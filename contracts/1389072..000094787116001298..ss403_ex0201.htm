AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of June 27, 2016
(the "Agreement Date"), is among Medtronic, Inc. ("Parent"), a Minnesota
corporation, Medtronic Acquisition Corp. ("Purchaser"), a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and HeartWare International, Inc.
(the "Company"), a Delaware corporation.

  

  

A. The respective boards of directors of the Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by the Parent upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

B. In furtherance of such acquisition, (i) Parent has agreed to cause the
Purchaser to commence a tender offer (such offer, as amended from time to time
as permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the shares
(the "Shares") of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") that are outstanding and not held by a Person
described in DGCL Section 251(h)(2)(a) through (d), at a price of $58.00 per
Share, paid to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (such amount or
any higher amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, the "Offer
Price") and (ii) as soon as practicable after the acquisition of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company, such
merger to be effected under Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL"), with the Company being the surviving corporation (the
"Merger"), and each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the
Offer, other than Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares, shall thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

C. The board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Transactions"), are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the
Offer and the Merger, and (iii) subject to the other terms and conditions of
this Agreement, resolved to recommend that all holders of Shares (the "Company
Stockholders") tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if required by
applicable Law, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger (the "Company
Board Recommendation").

  

  

D. The respective boards of directors of the Parent and the Purchaser have
approved this Agreement and Transactions, and have declared it advisable for
the Parent and the Purchaser, respectively, to enter into this Agreement.

  

  

E. The Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

  

  

Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE OFFER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Offer.

  

  

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, no later than the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall,
and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Terms and Conditions of Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) by Purchaser of those conditions set forth in Annex I (the "Offer
Conditions") as of any scheduled Expiration Date, Purchaser shall, and the
Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, accept for purchase and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly after such scheduled Expiration Date (the date and time of acceptance
for payment, the "Share Acceptance Time"). The Parent shall provide or cause
to be provided to the Purchaser on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase
and pay for any and all Shares that the Purchaser becomes obligated to accept
for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid net to the holder of such Share in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of any Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with Section 3.5.

  

  

(c) Offer to Purchase; Waiver of Conditions. The Offer shall be made by means
of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that describes the terms and
conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including the Offer
Conditions. The Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right (but
shall not be obligated) to increase the Offer Price, waive any condition to
the Offer (except the Minimum Condition) or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that unless previously
approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the
Offer Price payable in the Offer, (ii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer (other than by adding non-cash consideration, so long as
doing so does not materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Transaction), (iii) reduce the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the
Offer, (iv) impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (vi) amend or modify the
Offer Conditions in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or
impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to consummate the Offer,
(vii) extend the Expiration Date except as required by Section 1.1(e), or
(viii) otherwise amend any other term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the
holders of Shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Expiration of Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer shall expire on the twentieth (20th) Business Day (calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) following
the commencement of the Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date") or, if the Offer
has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, at the time and date to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in accordance with
this Agreement, the "Expiration Date").

  

  

(e) Extension of Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by (w) applicable Law, (x) applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff, (y)
any of the rules and regulations, including listing standards, of Nasdaq or
other United States national securities exchange registered under the Exchange
Act on which the applicable common stock is then traded (the "Securities
Exchange Rule") or (z) until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
and any applicable Antitrust Law in the countries set forth on Schedule 7.1
attached hereto in respect of the Transactions shall have expired or been
terminated, (ii) the Purchaser shall extend the Offer if at any then scheduled
Expiration Date, the Company shall have brought any action in accordance with
Section 9.12 to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser (x) for the period during
which such action is pending or (y) for such other time period established by
the court presiding over such action, (iii) in the event that any of the Offer
Conditions are not satisfied or waived, other than the Minimum Condition, as
of any then scheduled Expiration Date, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for successive extension periods of not more than ten (10) Business Days each
in order to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer, and (iv)
in the event that the Minimum Condition is not satisfied as of any then
scheduled Expiration Date and the Purchaser is not otherwise obligated to
extend the Offer pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, (A) the Company
may, by written notice at least two (2) Business Days prior to such scheduled
Expiration Date, require that the Purchaser extend the Offer for a up to two
(2) periods of ten (10) Business Days each, until the Minimum Condition is
satisfied, so long as there has not been a Change of Recommendation and (B)
the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for up to two (2)
periods of ten (10) Business Days each, until the Minimum Condition is
satisfied; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this Section 1.1(e), in no event shall the Purchaser be
required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (1) the date this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof or (2) the End Date;
and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 1.1(e) shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parent or
Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof. The
Purchaser shall not and the Parent agrees that it shall cause the Purchaser
not to terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

  

  

(f) Termination of Offer. The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to
any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the
Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Purchaser shall, and
the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, promptly terminate the Offer and
shall not acquire the Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by
the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 prior
to the acquisition of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days of such termination) return, or
cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares that have not then been
purchased in the Offer to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Schedule TO; Offer Documents. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the
date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act), the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in
accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall
include, as exhibits: the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal,
a form of summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and
instruments required by the Exchange Act or other applicable Law pursuant to
which the Offer shall be made (collectively, the "Offer Documents"). Subject
to Section 6.3, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the Company Board Recommendation. The Parent and Purchaser shall
disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders of the Shares as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. The Parent and the Purchaser shall cause
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects
with the requirement of applicable United States federal securities Laws and,
on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or
given to holders of Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except no covenant
is made by the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to information supplied by
the Company in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule TO or Offer Documents. The Parent and the Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct
any information provided by such party for use in the Offer Documents, if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the
Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to Company Stockholders, in each
case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and the Parent and the
Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, the
Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review any such written responses and the Parent and the Purchaser shall
give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel and shall use reasonable best
efforts to respond promptly to any such SEC comments.

  

  

(h) Certain Adjustments. The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a record date
is established) after the Agreement Date and prior to the payment by the
Purchaser for Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in connection
with the Offer.

Section 1.2 Company Action.

  

  

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date the
Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall, in a manner that
complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 6.3(e), contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the applicable United States federal securities Laws and
Delaware corporation Law and, on the date first filed with the SEC and on the
date first published, sent or given to holders of the Shares, not to contain
any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by the Parent or the Purchaser in writing
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
the Company Stockholders. The Company, on the one hand, and the Parent and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by such party for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it
is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Parent,
the Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide the
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments,
and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses thereto. The Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the
Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel and
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such SEC
comments. After the commencement of the Offer, the Company will not publish,
send or give to Company Stockholders supplemental or revised materials without
the Parent's prior written consent, except as (i) as may be required by Law or
(ii) as contemplated or permitted by Section 6.3.

  

  

(b) Communication Materials. Promptly after the Agreement Date (and in any
event in sufficient time to permit the Purchaser to commence the Offer in a
timely manner) and otherwise from time to time as requested by the Purchaser
or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial
owner lists and any other listings or computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such
information (including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their
addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its
agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial
owners of Shares, in connection with the preparation and dissemination of the

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 2.1 The Merger.

  

  

(a) Effect of Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and shall be governed by Section 251(h) of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and the Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
the Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(b) Charter and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Company's certificate of
incorporation (the "Company Charter") shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of
incorporation of the Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that all references therein to the Purchaser shall be deemed to
be references to the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law; provided, however, that
ARTICLE I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is
HeartWare International, Inc." The bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, except that all references therein to the Purchaser shall be
deemed to be references to the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

(c) Directors and Officers. The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, from
and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Other Conveyance Documents. The parties agree to take all necessary action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Closing without a meeting of the Company Stockholders, as provided in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, that any deeds,
bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.2 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and
pursuant to the DGCL (including Section 251(h) of the DGCL), the closing of
the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP,
Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts, as soon as
practicable following the Share Acceptance Time, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing), or at such other place as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.
At the Closing, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and
time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate
of Merger and agreed to by Purchaser and the Company, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time") and will make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

  

Section 3.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, pursuant to this
Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, the Purchaser or the holder of any Shares or any shares of
capital stock of the Purchaser:

  

  

(a) Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall convert into and
become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Parent or
the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no payment or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect
thereto.

  

  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)
and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, payable to the holder thereon, without any interest thereon,
equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time,
all such Shares shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of Shares not represented
by certificates ("Book Entry Shares") and the holders of certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares (the
"Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
other than the right to receive, upon transfer of such Book Entry Shares or
delivery of such Certificates in accordance with Section 3.2, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such Share held by them.

  

  

(d) If at any time between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time any
change in the number of outstanding Shares shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, other
than the Merger, the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
3.1(c) shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

  

  

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares.

  

  

(a) Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive
the consideration to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall
become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(c). At or prior to the Closing, the
Parent shall deliver, in trust, to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash hereinafter referred
to as "Consideration Fund"). In the event the Consideration Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by Section
3.1 (including with respect to former Dissenting Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL), the Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be
delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to
the deficiency required to make such payments.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book Entry Shares
whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1: (i) a letter of transmittal, in customary form, that
shall specify that delivery of such Certificates shall be deemed to have
occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(g)) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 3.2(g)) in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration in customary form. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(g)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and with
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid to holders
of Shares in connection with, or accrued on, the Merger Consideration. If any
Merger Consideration is to be paid to any natural person or any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or other entity or
organization, including any Governmental Entity ("Person") other than a Person
in whose name the Shares are registered, it shall be a condition of such
exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Shares, or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
pursuant to this ARTICLE III. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or
more Book Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such evidence, if any,
as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such Share and the Book
Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

  

  

(c) The Consideration Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in
excess of the amounts payable to Company Stockholders shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be
paid to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the Parent directs. No
investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by
this ARTICLE III, and following any losses from any such investment, the
Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying Agent for
the benefit of the Company Stockholder at the Effective Time in the amount of
such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Consideration Fund.

  

  

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE III, except as
otherwise provided by Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Company Stockholders
six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III with respect to such Certificates
or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
not have been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any
holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this ARTICLE III with respect thereto shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
not have been surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such
Certificate pursuant to this ARTICLE III.

  

  

Section 3.3 Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than as
provided in Section 3.3(b), any Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until
such Company Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholder's right to obtain payment of
the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, but
shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Dissenting
Shares as may be granted to such stockholder under the DGCL. From and after
the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to vote for any
purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions
(except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record
prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments, notices, petitions, or other
communication received from stockholders or provided to stockholders by the
Company with respect to any Dissenting Shares or shares claimed to be
Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with
the prior written consent of the Parent, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such dissent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If any Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
stockholder's right to obtain payment of the fair value of such stockholder's
Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such stockholder's
Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such
effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, shall be
treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration, without interest, as set forth in Section
3.1(c).

  

  

Section 3.4 Company Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or the appropriate
committee of the Company Board) shall adopt such resolutions or shall take
such other actions as are required to approve the transactions contemplated by
this Section 3.4. Prior to adopting any such resolutions or taking any such
action, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon such resolutions or action.

  

  

(b) Each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted under a
Company Equity Plan (each, a "Company Option") that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and for which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the exercise price of such Company Option, without
regard to the extent then vested or exercisable, shall be automatically
cancelled as of the Effective Time and, in consideration of such cancellation,
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly, but in no event
later than fifteen (15) days after the Effective Time, a cash payment in
respect of such cancellation from the Company in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number of unexercised
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Option for which, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration does not exceed the exercise price of
such Company Option shall be automatically cancelled as of the Effective Time
without any consideration being paid in respect thereof.

  

  

(c) Each restricted stock unit granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a
"Company Restricted Stock Unit") that is outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled as of the
Effective Time and, in consideration of such cancellation, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15)
days after the Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such cancellation
from the Company in an amount equal to the product of (x) the Merger
Consideration and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company Restricted Stock Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (with any such Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to
performance-based vesting being deemed earned assuming achievement of all
performance milestones).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) As of the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company shall be cancelled.

  

  

(e) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing and to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no
person shall have any right under the Company Equity Plans or any Benefit Plan
to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the payment timing
described previously in this Section 3.4 with respect to any payment made
pursuant to this Section 3.4, the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation retain the right to defer payment of any such amounts to the
extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall provide notice to each holder of Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock Units granted under the Company Equity Plans of his or her
ability to exercise or convert such awards immediately prior to the occurrence
of a change of control or change in control event (as such terms or other
similar terms are defined in the applicable Company Equity Plan) in accordance
with the terms of such plan.

  

  

Section 3.5 Withholding Tax. Each of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation,
and the Parent or their respective payment agent shall be entitled to deduct
or withhold from the consideration payable to any Person pursuant to ARTICLE
I, II, or III hereof such amounts required to be deducted or withheld with
respect to such payment under applicable Tax Law. If the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, so withholds such
amounts and so long as such amounts are actually paid to the applicable Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction
or withholding.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as disclosed in (a) the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company prior
to the Agreement Date (excluding any disclosure set forth therein under the

looking statement to the extent that they are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature) or (b) the disclosure schedule of the Company
delivered to the Parent concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which
the information stated in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates; provided
that (i) disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable or relevant to such other Section and (ii)
the mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect), the Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the
Purchaser as follows:

Section 4.1 Organization.

  

  

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has the requisite entity power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made available to the Parent a copy of its Company Charter and
bylaws (the "Company Bylaws"), each as amended to the date of this Agreement
(including an amendment to the Company Bylaws approved by the board of
directors of the Company to include an exclusive forum bylaw prior to the date

Section 4.5 SEC Reports; Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed all reports and other documents with the SEC
required to be filed by the Company since December 31, 2013 (the "Company SEC

complied in all material respects with, to the extent in effect at the time of
filing, the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto in effect at the time of such filing, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as

basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of

(the "Balance Sheet Date"), there has been no change in the Company's
accounting policies or the methods of making accounting estimates or changes

as described in the Company SEC Reports or except as may be required by any
regulatory authority.

(b) Since December 31, 2013, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has had
in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) reasonably designed and
maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company maintains internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

Subsidiaries has, since the Balance Sheet Date, incurred any liabilities or
obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, matured,
determined, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be
reflected in the Company's financial statements in accordance with GAAP),
except for (a) liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet
Date in the ordinary course of business, (b) liabilities and obligations
incurred in connection with the Transactions, (c) liabilities and obligations
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (d) liabilities and obligations

Each such contract described in clauses (i)-(x) is referred to herein as a
"Material Contract."

  

  

Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms and, to the Company's Knowledge, each other party
thereto, and is in full force and effect, and the Company has performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it to the
Agreement Date under each Material Contract and, to the Company's Knowledge,
each other party to each Material Contract has performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under such Material
Contract. The Company has not received written notice, nor does the Company
have Knowledge, of any material violation of or material default of any
obligation under (or any condition which with the passage of time or the
giving of notice would cause such a material violation of or material default
under) any Material Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound.

(b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person
(including an entity) that together with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or at any relevant time was treated as a single employer under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, together with the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries, an "ERISA Affiliate") has ever contributed or
been required to contribute to, or has ever sponsored, maintained or
participated in, (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of

4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which an ERISA Affiliate could reasonably be
expected to incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the
Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has,
prior to the date hereof, incurred any liability or obligation on account of a
"partial withdrawal" or a "complete withdrawal" (within the meaning of
Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from, or otherwise in respect of, any
multiemployer plan that has not been satisfied in full. No event has occurred
and no condition exists that is likely to subject the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates to any material liability under
Title IV of ERISA.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is covered by a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). No such determination or opinion letter
has been revoked, and, to the Company's Knowledge, revocation has not been
threatened. To the Company's Knowledge, no such Benefit Plan has been amended
or operated since the date of its most recent determination or opinion letter
in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect its qualification.

  

  

(d) Each Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms. Each Benefit Plan, including
any associated trust or fund, has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in compliance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws (including, where
applicable, non-U.S. Laws), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan that has subjected or could
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any
material liability or Tax under applicable Law. All material filings and
reports with respect to each Benefit Plan required to have been submitted to
the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or any other Governmental
Entity have been duly and timely submitted.

  

  

(e) No Benefit Plan provides health or life insurance benefits following
retirement or other termination of employment, and neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to provide any such benefits following
retirement or other termination of employment, in each case except for benefit
continuation coverage to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Code,
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any similar Law.

  

  

(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan, there is no pending, or the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened lawsuit, claim, administrative investigation,
action, inquiry, audit or other proceeding by the IRS, U.S. Department of
Labor or other Governmental Entity, and no other lawsuit, claim, action,
inquiry, voluntary compliance request, proceeding or other controversy, other
than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course and proceedings with
respect to qualified domestic relations orders, is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

  

  

(g) With respect to each Benefit Plan, all contributions (including salary
reduction contributions), premiums and other payments (i) to the extent due,
have been timely made, and (ii) to the extent not yet due, have been
appropriately accrued on the books of the Company or, if applicable, its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(h) Each Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") has
been documented and operated in all material respects in compliance with
Section 409A.

  

  

(i) Except for the Benefit Plans listed in Section 4.9(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Benefit Plan is subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States of America, whether or not United States Law also
applies. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands and the Virgin
Islands shall be considered jurisdictions other than the United States.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) Except for the Benefit Plans listed in Section 4.9(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each Benefit Plan and its related documentation or
agreement, summary plan description, or other written communication
distributed generally to employees by its terms expressly and adequately
reserves the right to amend and terminate such Benefit Plan, and each Benefit
Plan may be terminated without material liability to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, except for vested benefits accrued through the date of termination
and the administrative and professional costs incurred in such transaction.
Except as listed in Section 4.9(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Benefit Plan subject to ERISA includes in its assets any securities issued by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

  

  

(k) Except as listed in Section 4.9(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Transactions, either alone or in combination with another event, including
a termination of employment or service, will: (i) entitle any Covered Employee
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof to any severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment; (ii) result in or accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of, or otherwise increase, any amounts due to any Covered
Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof under any Benefit Plan, or
(iii) result in any payment or benefit that would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is obligated to "gross up" any Tax incurred by any Person
pursuant to Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code.

effect, except where the failure to obtain or have any such Permit would,
individually or in the aggregate, not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and no proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened to revoke, suspend, cancel, terminate or materially
adversely modify any such Permit. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or in
default under, any Law, in each case, applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and properties. Notwithstanding

a whole, as currently conducted, in each case, free and clear of all
imperfections of title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements,
except (i) liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable, that are payable
without penalty or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, (ii) such imperfections of title, restrictions, encroachments,
liens and easements as do not and could not reasonably be expected to
materially detract from or materially interfere with the use or value of the
properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair
business operations involving such properties and (iii) liens securing debt
which are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. There are no written or oral
subleases, licenses, occupancy agreements or other contractual obligations

Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Real Property"), and there is no
person in possession of the Real Property other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries. There is no pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

and each Subsidiary that are used in the operations of business are in all
material respects (i) in good operating condition and repair (ordinary wear
and tear excepted) and (ii) have been maintained in accordance with normal
industry practices. Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all

by Environmental Law necessary to enable them to conduct their respective

Material Adverse Effect. All such permits are in full force and effect and, to
the Company's Knowledge, there are no pending or threatened claims that seek
the revocation, cancellation, suspension or any adverse modification of any
such permits, except where the failure to have any such Permit would not,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND THE PURCHASER

  

  

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule of the Parent and the Purchaser
delivered to the Company concurrently herewith (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule") (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which
the information stated in such Parent Disclosure Schedule relates); provided
that (a) disclosure in any section of such Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable or relevant to such other Section and (b)
the mere inclusion of an item in such Parent Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, the Parent and the Purchaser jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

  

  

Section 5.1 Organization. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Parent has made
available or will make available to the Company a copy of the articles of
incorporation or certificate of incorporation, as the case may be, and bylaws
or other equivalent organizational documents of the Parent and the Purchaser,
as currently in effect.

  

  

Section 5.2 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action. Each of
the Parent and the Purchaser has the requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Parent and the Purchaser of this
Agreement, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action of
the Parent and the Purchaser (other than the adoption of this Agreement in
respect of the Merger, with respect to which the written consent of the sole
stockholder of the Purchaser shall occur promptly following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement), and no other corporate action on the part of the
Parent or the Purchaser is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
by the Parent and the Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation by them
of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Parent and the Purchaser and, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Company, is a valid and binding
obligation of each of the Parent and the Purchaser, enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, except that (a) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and (b) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Parent and the Purchaser do not, and the performance
by the Parent and the Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Parent and the Purchaser of the Transactions will not, (a) violate any
provision of the articles of incorporation or certificate of incorporation, as
the case may be, or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the
Parent or the Purchaser, (b) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any Contract
to which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them or any of their properties or assets is bound, (c) violate any Law
applicable to the Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties
or assets or (d) other than in connection with or compliance with (i) the
DGCL, (ii) requirements under other state corporation Laws, (iii) the HSR Act
and other Antitrust Laws, (iv) Securities Exchange Rules, and (v) the Exchange
Act, require on the part of the Parent or the Purchaser any filing or
registration with, notification to, or authorization, consent or approval of,
any Governmental Entity; except, in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), for
such violations, breaches or defaults that, or filings, registrations,
notifications, authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to
make or obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.4 Disclosure Documents.

  

  

(a) The Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed, distributed or
disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and

connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Company or its

respect to (i) any projections or forecasts, estimates or budgets for the
Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) any materials, documents or information

Knowledge of the Parent, threatened against or affecting, the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Parent's or the
Purchaser's ability to consummate the Transactions. Neither the Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries, is subject to any Order against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or naming the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a party that

Section 6.2 Access to Information. From the Agreement Date until the earlier
of the Share Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to
Representatives of the Parent and the Purchaser reasonable access, in a manner
not materially disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
the properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether
in the direct possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries or held by its
Representatives) and, during such period, shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in each case as may reasonably be requested and necessary to
consummate the Transactions (and not to conduct further due diligence or other
investigation of the Company); provided, however, that nothing herein shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to
the Parent or the Purchaser if such disclosure would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, (a) violate applicable Law or the provisions of any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (provided
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers of
any such restrictions) or (b) waive attorney-client privilege. Promptly after
the Agreement Date, the Company shall provide to the Parent a copy of the
Company financial advisor's fairness opinion, a summary of the analysis
underlying such fairness opinion and a copy of the relevant portions of the
Company financial advisor's presentation to the Company Board related thereto.
That certain letter agreement, dated January 19, 2016, by and between the
Company and the Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall apply with
respect to information furnished hereunder by or on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.3 Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.3(b), 6.3(e) and 6.3(f), the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, from the Agreement
Date until the Share Acceptance Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VIII (i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly
encourage or facilitate, or participate or engage in any negotiations,
inquiries or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or proposal reasonably likely to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, disclose or furnish any nonpublic information or
data to any Person concerning the Company's business or properties or afford
any Person other than the Parent or its Representatives access to its
properties, books, or records, except as required by a governmental demand for
information, (iii) enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute,
any agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, endorse,
recommend or make or authorize any statement, recommendation, or solicitation
in support of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal relating to an
Acquisition Proposal other than with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the
Transactions (other than any confidential statement, recommendation or
solicitation by and among the Company, the Company Board and their
Representatives); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company may refer any third party to this Section 6.3.
The Company will, and will direct its Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations that commenced
prior to the Agreement Date regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time following the Agreement Date and prior to the Share Acceptance
Time the Company is contacted by any third party expressing an interest in
discussing an Acquisition Proposal or receives an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case, that is not the result of the Company having materially breached
Section 6.3(a), the Company and the Company Board may participate or engage in
negotiations, inquiries or discussions (including, as a part thereof, making
any counterproposal) with, or disclose or furnish any nonpublic information
and data to, any Person or Persons (but only after any such Person enters into
a confidentiality agreement, that is no less restrictive in terms of
confidentiality than, the Confidentiality Agreement, with the Company which
may not provide for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may
not restrict the Company from complying with this Section 6.3(b)) making such
contact or making such Acquisition Proposal and their respective
Representatives and potential sources of financing, if, and only if, prior to
the Share Acceptance Time the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors, that such Person or Persons have
submitted to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with counsel, that the failure to
participate in such negotiations, inquiries or discussions, disclose or
furnish such information, would reasonably be expected to violate the
fiduciary duties of the Company's directors under applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify the Parent in writing of
the receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business or, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall notify the Parent, in writing, of any decision of
the Company Board as to whether to enter into discussions or negotiations with
any third parties concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to disclose or
furnish nonpublic information with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such determination was reached (and in any event
no later than twenty-four (24) hours after such determination was reached).
The Company will (i) provide the Parent with written notice setting forth all
such information (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal) as is reasonably necessary to keep the Parent informed of the status
and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any material
amendments thereto, (ii) promptly provide the Parent a copy of all written
information provided by or on behalf of such Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or provided by or on behalf of the Company or its
Representatives to such Person (other than any information which has
previously been made available to Parent or its Representatives), and (iii)
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such
determination) notify the Parent of any determination by the Company Board
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement
with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date that would restrict the
Company's ability to provide to Parent the information set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii) above, and, if the Company is a party to any agreement that would
prohibit the Company from providing such information to Parent, prior to
providing non-public information to, or engaging in discussions or
negotiations with, the counterparty to such agreement, the Company will obtain
approval from the counterparty to such agreement to allow the Company to
provide such information to Parent.

  

  

(d) Subject to Section 6.3(e) and 6.3(f), unless and until this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (w) withdraw,
qualify, or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify (other than in
any confidential communication by and among the Company, the Company Board and
their Representatives), in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the
Company Board Recommendation, (x) make any public disclosure inconsistent with
the Company Board Recommendation, or, fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal
within two (2) Business Days of a written request by Parent; (y) approve,
adopt, or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt, or recommend (other than in
any confidential communication by and among the Company, the Company Board and
their Representatives), any Acquisition Proposal or (z) in the event of a
tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding Shares, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company
Stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement thereof (any
action described in clauses (w)-(z) being referred to as a "Change of
Recommendation") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding (x)
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (y) requiring it to abandon,
terminate, or fail to consummate the Transactions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Share Acceptance Time, the
Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor (in the case
of clause (i) below) that (i) (x) a written Acquisition Proposal received by
the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the
Company's directors under applicable Law, or (ii) in the absence of an
Acquisition Proposal, due to events, facts or developments not known by the
Company or, in the Company Board's estimation, not reasonably likely to occur
(or the consequences of which were not known by the Company or, in the Company
Board's estimation, not reasonably likely to occur) as of the Agreement Date
(which events, facts or developments do not relate to (A) any Acquisition
Proposal, (B) any events, facts or developments relating to the Parent,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, (C) clearance of the Merger under any
applicable Antitrust Laws or (D) the mere fact that the Company meets or
exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or
predictions of revenue, earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for
any period ending on or after the date hereof or changes in the market price
or trading value of the Shares or the credit rating for the Company (but not
including the underlying cause thereof)), the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the Company's
directors under applicable Law, (1) make a Change of Recommendation, or (2) in
the case of clause (i) above, terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (2) and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (2)
shall be void and of no force or effect unless, in advance of or concurrently
with such termination, the Company (A) pays the Termination Fee as required by
Section 8.2, (B) simultaneously with such termination enters into a merger
agreement, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, purchase agreement
or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (the
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement") and (C) terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii); provided, further, that the Company Board may
not effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) unless (A) the
Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent at least five
(5) calendar days in advance (the "Notice Period") of its intention to take
such action with respect to such Superior Proposal or otherwise make a Change
of Recommendation, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
marking such Superior Proposal) or the reasons for such Change of
Recommendation in the absence of a Superior Proposal, as the case may be, (B)
prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall direct its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with the Parent in good faith
(to the extent the Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (C) following the Notice Period
(and giving effect to any proposed adjustments to the terms of this Agreement)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel (and financial advisor in the case of clause (i) below)
that (i) such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or (ii) the
failure to make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to
violate the fiduciary duties of the Company's directors under applicable Law.
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal or material
changes to the facts and circumstances necessitating such Change of
Recommendation after the start of the Notice Period, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.3(e) with respect to such new written notice,
and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such
new notice, but with respect to any such notices references herein to a period
of "five (5) calendar days" shall be deemed references to a period of "three
(3) calendar days". Any Change of Recommendation shall not change the approval
of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other Law to be inapplicable to the Transactions, including each of the Offer
and the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder; provided that nothing in this
clause (f) shall alter the consequences of a Change of Recommendation. For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate statement that describes the
Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change
of Recommendation.

  

  

Section 6.4 Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who remains in the
employment of Parent or Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") with (i) a base
salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less than the
base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity in effect for each
such Continuing Employee immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits (including severance, vacation, sick, and personal time off
benefits, but excluding any equity-based, retention-related or change-in-
control related compensation and bonus plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those
provided to Continuing Employees immediately preceding the Effective Time;
provided, however, that during the period set forth in this subsection (a)
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive long-term incentive
compensation on the same basis as provided to similarly situated employees of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its or its Affiliate's employee benefit
plans, program or policies following the Effective Time and subject to
applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, recognize the prior
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including prior service
with predecessor employers where such prior service is recognized by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, of each Continuing Employee for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and determination of level of benefits in any employee benefit plans,
programs or policies of Parent or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees
are eligible to participate (but not (A) for purposes of vesting in stock
options and other equity awards, (B) for the purposes of benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan or (C) to the extent that such
recognition would result in duplication of benefits).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Subject to applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its subsidiaries to, cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of
Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents to the extent such Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable Benefit Plans
as of the time immediately preceding the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall, following consultation with Parent, use their
reasonable best efforts to satisfy all notice, consultation and consent
requirements with respect to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under applicable Law, or the terms of any collective bargaining agreement or
other Contract with a labor union or other employee representative body or
works council.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.4 will (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, including any
Benefit Plan or (ii) limit or prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or terminating any employee
benefit plan, including any Benefit Plan. The provisions of this Section 6.4
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement, and no
provision of this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or otherwise.

  

  

Section 6.5 Publicity. The initial press release by each of the Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to
the Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor the Parent (nor any of
their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
without the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by
Law or by any Securities Exchange Rule, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable
best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any
such public announcements; provided that the Company will no longer be
required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with the Parent in
connection with any such press release or public announcement if the Company
Board has made a Change of Recommendation or in connection with any such press
release or public announcement pursuant to Section 6.3(e), provided, that the
Company, in all such events, shall provide Parent with a copy of any such
press release or public announcement a reasonable time in advance of public
dissemination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.6 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at
any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company
or any of its present or former Subsidiaries or corporate parents
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions) to the fullest extent
that the Surviving Corporation is permitted by Law, and the Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent that the Surviving Corporation is permitted by
Law. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement
of expenses set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as amended, restated and in effect on the Agreement Date, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties,
unless such modification is required by Law.

  

  

(b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 6.6, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions
of, any agreement in effect as of the Agreement Date between or among the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(c) The Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six
(6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any
other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such
insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Insured
Parties") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefore would
not be in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the last annual
premium paid prior to the Effective Time (the "Maximum Premium").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a so-called "Reporting Tail Endorsement"
with an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, in which case,
provided that the Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time, the Parent shall be relieved from its other
obligations under this Section 6.6.

  

  

(d) This Section 6.6 is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. The Parent
hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of
the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this Section 6.6 and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) After the Effective Time, the Parent guarantees the full performance of
the Surviving Corporation of its covenants and obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6.

  

  

Section 6.7 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and to make all other filings required by applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of any applicable legal
deadline (provided that the filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act will be made within ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement
Date) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be required pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law. The parties shall also consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any such Antitrust Laws.
Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree (i) to give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) to the extent practicable, to give each
other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with
any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws, (iii) if any
Governmental Entity initiates a substantive oral communication regarding any
Antitrust Laws, to promptly notify the other party of such communication, and
(iv) to provide each other with copies of all written communications from any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or
provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Parent agrees, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, to use reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions
necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in
connection with Antitrust Laws, and to enable all waiting periods under
applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to use reasonable best efforts to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under applicable Antitrust Laws
asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to cause the Transactions
to occur prior to the End Date, including but not limited to (x) promptly
complying with or modifying any requests for additional information (including
any second request) by any Governmental Entity, and (y) contesting, defending
and appealing any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order
that would adversely affect the ability of any party hereto to consummate the
Transactions and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.7(a), in no event shall Parent or the Purchaser be required to
offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any of
the capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries. Each party shall bear its own expenses and costs incurred in
connection with any HSR Act filings or other such competition filings and
submissions which may be required by such party for the consummation of the
Transactions pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by Section 6.7(a), the Company, the Parent and the
Purchaser shall, and the Parent and the Company shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, each use their reasonable best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable;

  

  

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders and
send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by the Company or the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions; provided that in connection therewith none
of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required to (nor, without the prior
written consent of the Parent, will) make or agree to make any payment or
accept any material conditions or obligations, including amendments to
existing conditions and obligations;

  

  

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and
notifications, and thereafter make any other submissions and applications with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions required under any applicable
statute, law, rule or regulation; and

  

  

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions, or to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and the Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate) all information
required for any filing, submission, application or request to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.7(a)
shall modify, limit or otherwise affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 6.7(a).

  

  

Section 6.8 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Share Acceptance Time, the
Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition of equity securities of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.9 Tax Matters. Except as otherwise provided herein, all real and
personal property, transfer, documentary, sales, use registration, value
added, stamp duty and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with the
Transactions shall be borne by the Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
transfer Taxes shall not include any Taxes measured in whole or in part by net
income.

Section 6.11 Delisting. The Company agrees to cause to be taken all actions
necessary to (a) delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and (b) to
terminate the registration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act;
provided that such delisting or termination shall not be effective until after
the Effective Time. The Parent will use all reasonable best efforts to cause
the Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a Form 25 on the date of
the Closing and (b) a Form 15 on the first Business Day that is at least ten
(10) days after the date the Form 25 is filed (such period between the Form 25
filing date and the Form 15 filing date, the "Delisting Period"). If the
Surviving Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the Company will
deliver to the Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing a
substantially final draft of any such reports reasonably likely to be required
to be filed during the Delisting Period ("Post-Closing SEC Reports"). The
Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.11
will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading and (ii) comply in all material respects with
the provisions of applicable Laws.

  

  

Section 6.12 401(k). Except with the prior written consent of the Parent,
during the period from the Agreement Date to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not (a) make any discretionary contribution to the Company's 401(k)
plan, other than employer matching contributions at the rate in effect
immediately prior to the Agreement Date, or (b) make any required contribution
to the Company's 401(k) plan in Shares. If requested by the Parent in writing
at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled Expiration Date, the Company
shall terminate the Company's 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

Section 6.13 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Agreement Date, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) has taken all
such steps as may be required to cause any and all employment compensation,
severance and employee benefit agreements and arrangements entered into by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or contemplated hereby with any of their
respective officers, directors or employees to be approved as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d−10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d−10(d)
under the Exchange Act. The Company has provided Parent with copies of all
such actions.

  

  

Section 6.14 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give the Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the
Share Acceptance Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Parent's or its Subsidiaries' operations. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44

Purchaser shall not engage in any other business activities and shall not have
incurred any liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein.

the Parent or the Purchaser or any wholly owned Subsidiaries of their ultimate
parent shall acquire any Shares except pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.17 Treatment of Convertible Notes.

  

  

(a) The Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent will take all necessary
action to execute and deliver supplemental indentures to the Trustee (as
defined in the Indenture, dated as of December 15, 2010 (the "Base
Indenture"), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association,
as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated
December 15, 2010 (the "2017 Indenture"), between the Company and Wilmington
Trust, National Association, as further amended and supplemented by the Second
Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 13, 2015 (the "2021 Indenture"),
between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the Base
Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the 2017 Indenture and the 2021
Indenture, the "Indenture")) prior to the Effective Time with respect to each
of the 2017 Convertible Notes and the 2021 Convertible Notes, respectively, to
provide, among other things, that at and after the Effective Time, the right
to convert the Convertible Notes shall be changed into a right to convert each
$1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes into cash in an amount equal to
the Conversion Rate (as defined in each of the 2017 Indenture and 2021
Indenture, as applicable) in effect on the relevant Conversion Date (as
defined in each of the 2017 Indenture and the 2021 Indenture, as applicable),
multiplied by the Offer Price in accordance with Section 4.06 of each of the
2017 Indenture and the 2021 Indenture. As promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement and otherwise as reasonably requested by Parent,
the Company will provide Parent with the position listing of the Convertible
Notes, including the number of record holders. In addition, (1) the Company
will provide notice of the anticipated effective date of the Fundamental
Change (as defined in each of the 2017 Indenture and the 2021 Indenture) and
the Merger (and such other matters as may be required or permitted under the
Indenture) to holders of the Convertible Notes and the trustee, paying agent
and conversion agent of the Convertible Notes promptly after the date of this
Agreement and in any event within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof and
file such notice with the SEC as a pre-commencement communication under
Schedule TO and make such notice available on the Company's website pursuant
to Section 4.01(b) and Section 4.09 of each of the 2017 Indenture and the 2021
Indenture and (2) prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Surviving
Corporation will take all such other actions as may be required in accordance
with, and subject to, the terms of the Indenture including delivery of any
supplemental indentures, legal opinions, officers' certificates or other
documents or instruments required to comply with the Indenture. Prior to
taking any of the foregoing actions, the Company shall consult with and
reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to the action and the intended
manner and form thereof. Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any notice, announcement, certificate or legal opinion before such
document is provided to the trustee under the Indenture, and the Company shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent.
The Company will not make any settlement election under or make any change to
the terms of the Indenture without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, each
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with Parent and
Purchaser in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable with respect to
the Convertible Notes and as promptly as practicable, make all filings and
notifications as reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser, and execute or
deliver any additional instruments with respect to the Convertible Notes as
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser; provided, however, consummation
of any amendments to the Indenture or the Convertible Notes made pursuant to
the foregoing provision will not be effective prior to the Effective Time and
in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII,
Parent will reimburse the Company for any reasonable expenses with respect to
the foregoing obligations.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

  

CONDITIONS

  

  

Section 7.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
obligations of the Company, on the one hand, and the Parent and the Purchaser,
on the other hand, to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction
(or waiver by the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser, if permissible under
Law) of the following conditions:

  

  

(a) no Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, the Parent or
the Purchaser shall have enacted or issued any Law or Order or taken any other
action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

  

(b) the Purchaser (or the Parent on the Purchaser's behalf) shall have
accepted for payment and paid for all of the Shares validly tendered pursuant
to the Offer and not properly withdrawn, provided, however, that this Section
7.1(b) shall not be a condition to the obligation of the Parent or the
Purchaser to consummate the Merger if the failure to satisfy such condition
shall arise from the Parent's or the Purchaser's breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.2 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, the Parent
or the Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section

in good faith or use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Transactions, as required by and subject to Section 6.7.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46

to the Share Acceptance Time:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and the Parent;

Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
whose material breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of such conditions to be satisfied on or prior to such date; or

  

  

(ii) if any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, the

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that if
such breach or inaccuracy is capable of being cured prior to the earlier of
(x) the End Date and (y) the date that is twenty (20) Business Days from the
date the Parent is notified in writing by the Company of such breach or

Section 8.1(c)(i) shall not be available to the Company if it has failed to
perform in any material respect any of its obligations under or in connection
with this Agreement;

  

  

(ii) prior to the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, in
order to accept a Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 6.3(e); or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) if, for any reason, (x) the Purchaser shall have failed to commence the
Offer by 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is five (5) Business Days
after the date set forth in Section 1.1(a), provided, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(iii) (x) if such
failure to commence the Offer has resulted from the breach of Section 1.2 or
Section 6.2 by the Company, (y) the Purchaser terminates or makes any change
to the Offer in breach of the terms of this Agreement or (z) the Purchaser
shall have breached its obligations to accept for purchase all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn as of the Initial Expiration Date or any
subsequent Expiration Date established in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

  

  

(d) By the Parent or the Purchaser:

  

  

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be untrue, in any case
such that an Offer Condition would not be satisfied; provided, however, that
if such breach or inaccuracy is capable of being cured prior to the earlier of
(x) the End Date and (y) the date that is twenty (20) Business Days from the
date the Company is notified in writing by the Parent of such breach or
inaccuracy, the Parent and the Purchaser may not terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) (1) prior to such date if the Company is
taking reasonable best efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy and (2)
following such date if such breach or inaccuracy is cured at or prior to such
date; provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(d)(i) shall not be available to the Parent or the Purchaser if
either of them has failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under or in connection with this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) if, prior to the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer,
the Company Board shall have made a Change of Recommendation.

  

  

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made and a reasonably detailed description of the basis
therefor, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and there
shall be no liability on the part of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company
or their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to the Parent,
the Purchaser and the Company, the obligations pursuant to this Section 8.2,
and ARTICLE IX, the last sentence of Section 6.2 and Section 6.5; provided,
however, that except as set forth in Section 8.2(b) nothing contained in this
Section 8.2 shall relieve the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company from
liability for fraud or intentional and material breach of their respective
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If

  

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii),

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii),

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i)
following a knowing, material breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Representatives of Section 6.3, or

  

  

(iv) (x) this Agreement is terminated by (A) the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i) (but only if at such time the Parent would not be prohibited
from terminating this Agreement by the proviso in Section 8.1(b)(i)) but only
as a result of the failure of the Minimum Condition or the Offer Conditions
set forth in clauses (c)(ii), (c)(iii) or (c)(v) of Annex I, or (B) by the
Parent or the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), (y) there has been
publicly disclosed after the Agreement Date and prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal that remains outstanding
and not withdrawn as of the date of termination of this Agreement, and (z)
within twelve (12) months after such termination of this Agreement, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Qualifying
Transaction or consummates a Qualifying Transaction (in each case regardless
of whether the Qualifying Transaction is the Acquisition Proposal referred to
in clause (y)),

  

  

then the Company shall pay to the Parent a termination fee of $27,500,000 in
cash (the "Termination Fee"),

  

  

(A) concurrently with any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii),

  

  

(B) within one (1) Business Day after termination pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii) or pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) if Parent is entitled to the
Termination Fee under Section 8.2(b)(iii), and

  

  

(C) within one (1) Business Day after the Company executes and delivers a
definitive agreement with respect to (or, if earlier, consummates) a
Qualifying Transaction as set forth in Section 8.2(b)(iv);

  

  

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Upon payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant Section 8.2(b)(i), the Company shall have no further liability to the
Parent or the Purchaser and such payment shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and the Purchaser for any loss with respect to this Agreement
or the Transaction, provided that nothing herein shall release the Company
from liability for intentional and material breach of this Agreement or fraud.
All payments contemplated by this Section 8.2(b) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Parent
and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. If the Company fails to
promptly make any payment required under this Section 8.2(b) and the Parent
commences a suit to collect such payment, the Company shall indemnify the
Parent for its fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such suit and shall pay interest on the amount of
the payment at the prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors or
assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2(b).

damages against any other party hereto in connection with or arising out of

ANNEX I

  

  

Capitalized terms used in this Annex I and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to
which it is attached (the "Agreement").

  

  

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, the Purchaser shall not be
required to, and the Parent shall not be required to cause the Purchaser to,
accept for payment, purchase or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-19(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, pay for any validly tendered Shares and may delay the acceptance
for payment of, purchase or, subject to the restrictions referred to above,
the payment for, any validly tendered Shares, if:

  

  

(a) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at the Expiration
Date;

  

  

(b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and any applicable
Antitrust Law in the countries set forth on Schedule 7.1 attached hereto in
respect of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement has not expired or
been terminated at or prior to the Expiration Date;

  

  

(c) any of the following conditions exists or has occurred, and is continuing
at the Expiration Date:

  

  

(i) there shall be any Law or Order enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or
deemed applicable, pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf
of a Governmental Entity, prohibiting or making illegal the Offer or the
Merger;

  

  

(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement shall not be true and accurate when made or at the consummation
of the Offer, except (1) those representations and warranties that address
matters only as of a particular date or only with respect to a specific period
of time, which representations and warranties need only be true and accurate
as of such date or with respect to such period, (2) any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in Section 4.2(a) or (b) (subject to de
minimis exceptions), and Section 4.3 shall be deemed to be not true and
accurate if it fails to be true and accurate in all respects, and (3) for any
representation or warranty of the Company (other than any representation or
warranty referred to in clause 2 above), where failure to be so true and
accurate, individually or in the aggregate, does not have or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "material adverse
effect" set forth therein);

  

  

(iii) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to
perform or to comply with any agreement or covenant required to be performed
or complied with by it under the Agreement;

  

  

(iv) since the date of the Agreement, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall
have occurred and be continuing;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) the Parent and the Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate
executed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer or President on behalf of
the Company, dated as of the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, to the
effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this Annex I have not occurred; or

  

  

(vi) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

  

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Parent and the
Purchaser and may be asserted by the Parent or the Purchaser regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by the
Parent or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time
in their sole discretion (except the Minimum Condition may not be waived), in
each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and applicable Laws. The
failure by the Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.
