BACKGROUND

  



   | A| Under the terms of a sale and purchase agreement entered into on 31
October 2019 (the "SPA") between the Parties, subject to certain conditions
being met, Spirit agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of
Short Brothers Plc ("SB PLC") from BAUK ("Project Atlantic"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | B| Clause 3.4 of the SPA provided that, on completion of Project
Atlantic ("Completion"), Spirit shall procure that an amount equal to £100m
(the "Special Contribution") is paid to the Short Brothers Pension Scheme
("SBPS"). Under Clause 4.1(e) of the SPA, Completion is conditional on the
triennial valuation of the SBPS as at 31 December 2018 being agreed and
finalised by SB PLC and Short Brothers Pension Trustee Limited (the
"Trustee") on a basis consistent with the terms of a Memorandum of
Understanding entered into between BI, Spirit and the Trustee (the
"MoU Parties") on 31 October 2019 (the "MoU"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | C| The MoU is non-legally binding and sets out the MoU Parties'
understanding and intentions at the time it was entered into in connection
with the SBPS in the event that Spirit is successful in acquiring the entire
issued share capital of SB PLC. Under Clause 4.3 of the MoU, subject to
Completion (referred to as "Closing" in the MoU), Spirit agreed to procure
the payment of the Special Contribution to the SBPS. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | D| Clause 6.2.5 of the MoU further provided that the Parties intended
the core deficit reduction contributions payable to the SBPS by SB PLC (as
agreed at the 2015 actuarial valuation) to continue until 30 June 2025 subject
to a reassessment at the 2021 actuarial valuation of the SBPS. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | E| Following discussions between the MoU Parties, on or around the
date of this Deed, the MoU Parties have entered into an agreement to vary the
MoU which provides, amongst other things, for: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the deferral of the payment of the Special Contribution so that
the Special Contribution is payable on the first anniversary of Completion;
and 
---|---|---

   | (ii)| the provision, with effect from Completion, of a parent company
guarantee (generally capped at £112,400,000) for the benefit of the SBPS by
SAI. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | F| Clause 31 of the SPA provides that the SPA may be altered by
agreement in writing duly executed by each Party that refers to the SPA.
Having regard to the amendments made to the MoU as referred to at Recital E
above, the Parties wish to amend certain provisions of the SPA that relate to
the SBPS. 
---|---|---

" _SBPS Guarantee_ _means the guarantee (generally capped at £112,400,000) to
be provided by the US Buyer for the benefit of the Short Brothers
Pension Scheme in the form appended to this Agreement at Schedule 15_";

  



   | 2.2| by replacing the definition of "Pension Scheme MoU" at Clause 1.1
of the SPA with the following: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

" _Pension Scheme MoU_ _ means the memorandum of understanding in connection
with the Short Brothers Pension Scheme entered into between BI, the UK
Buyer and the Pension Scheme Trustee on or about the date of this Agreement
as amended from time to time by agreement of those parties_ ";

  



   | 2.3| by replacing Clause 3.4 of the SPA with the following: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

" _3.4 By or before the first anniversary of Completion, the UK Buyer
shall procure that:_

  



  

 _(a) Shorts is put in funds to enable Shorts to pay to the Short Brothers
Pension Scheme an amount either equal to £100,000,000 (the Pension
Scheme Amount), or such lesser amount as is agreed by the Buyer, BI and the
Pension Scheme Trustee; and _

  



  

 _(b) Shorts pays the Pension Scheme Amount to the Short Brothers Pension
Scheme._ ";

  



   | 2.4| by adding a new Clause 3.4A of the SPA immediately after the

2(b) and replacing it with " _; and_ "; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.5.3| by adding a new paragraph 2(c) to Schedule 5 as follows: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

" _(c) deliver to the Pension Scheme Trustee the duly executed SBPS
Guarantee. "_; and

  



  

   

2

 



    



   | 2.6| by adding a new Schedule 15 to the SPA in the form of the
schedule included at Appendix A to this Deed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3| SPA provisions 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any provisions of the SPA not expressly varied by this Deed shall remain in
full force and effect on their existing terms.

_Counterparts_ ), 35 ( _Agreement binding_ ), 36 ( _Rights of Third Parties_
) and 38 ( _Notices_ ) to 42 ( _Service of Process_ ) of the SPA shall be
deemed to be incorporated into this Deed, save that references therein to
"this Agreement" shall be deemed to be references to this Deed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.2| This Deed shall be presumed to be delivered and is intended by
the Parties to be a deed (and shall take effect as a deed) only when and not
before it is dated. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

IN WITNESS whereof the Parties have executed this Deed as a deed on the date
shown on page one.
