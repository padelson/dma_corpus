Section 2.6 _Treatment of Company Options_.

  



  

(a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof,
be converted into the right to receive an option (a " _Parent Option_ ") (i)
with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the applicable number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the

conversion shall in all events be done in a manner that complies with the

of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, but shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same vesting and exercise terms and conditions as applied to
the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions and take
such other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the
Company Options as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each outstanding Parent
Option, and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof, and the number and
kind of shares available for issuance with respect to such assumed Parent
Option shall be adjusted to reflect shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Company Option Plan and the

Section 2.7 _Exchange Procedures for Company Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Procedures_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall mail or
otherwise deliver, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise
deliver, to each Company Stockholder entitled to receive the Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ , a letter of transmittal substantially in the
form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto, with such changes as may be agreed
between the Company and Parent prior to the Closing or as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent (the " _Company Letter of Transmittal_ "),
together with any notice required pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article VII_ , in the event that at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
Company Stockholder does not deliver to the Exchange Agent a duly executed
and completed Company Letter of Transmittal, then such failure shall not
alter, limit or delay the Closing; _provided_ that such Company Stockholder
shall not be entitled to receive its respective Consideration until such
Person delivers a duly executed and completed the Letter of Transmittal to the
Exchange Agent (in the case of a Letter of Transmittal). Upon delivery of
such duly executed Letter of Transmittal by such Company Stockholder to the
Exchange Agent, such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Consideration in respect
of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock referenced in such Letter of
Transmittal. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.7_ , each
share of Company Common Stock shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled pursuant to
this _Article II_.

  



  

   

-7-

 



    



  

(b) _No Further Rights_. All Consideration paid upon the surrender of Company
Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to
have been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the securities represented by such Company Stock and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of the shares of Company Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
holders of Company Stock shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the
Company, except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) _Changes in Parent Stock_. If at any time between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Class B Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number of kind of shares or securities as a
result of a subdivision, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or other
similar change in capitalization, in each case other than in connection with
the Merger, then the definition of Reference Price and the per share price set
forth in _Section 6.24_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.7(c)_ shall be construed to
permit Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no evidence of book-entry shares representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for Company Stock. In lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which each holder of Company
Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down
to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, with a fraction of 0.5
rounded up. No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional
shares eliminated by rounding.

  



  

(e) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, shall be paid to any Company Stockholder that has not delivered a
properly completed, duly executed Company Letter of Transmittal. After the
delivery of such materials, the Company Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which had become payable with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable
to such Company Stockholder.

(f) _Company Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Company Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into the right to receive its applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Company
Dissenting Share pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of Company Dissenting
Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for
such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but
only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to the DGCL). If, after the Effective Time, any
Company Dissenting Share shall lose its status as a Company Dissenting Share,
then any such share shall immediately be converted into the right to receive
its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if such share never had
been a Company Dissenting Share, and Parent shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the holder
thereof, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
this _Section 2.7_ , its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if
such share had never been a Company Dissenting Share. The Company shall give
Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company, and (b) the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand with respect to any Company
Dissenting Share. The Company shall (or shall cause their Affiliates to)
enforce any contractual waivers that the Equityholders have granted regarding
appraisal rights that would apply to the Merger.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parties, the Surviving
Company, the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment under all applicable Laws; provided, however, except (i) with respect
to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees or former
employees or (ii) any withholding resulting from the failure of the Company to
provide a FIRPTA Certificate pursuant to _Section 6.8(c)_ , that prior to any
such withholding, the Parent Stockholders or the Company Stockholders, as
applicable, shall be provided reasonable notice of such intent to withhold
and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to reduce or
eliminate any such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Parties, the Surviving Company, the Escrow Agent or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Parent Stockholders or the
Equityholders, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) The Merger Consideration shall be increased or reduced as set forth in
_Section 2.9(f)_ hereof. Any increase or decrease in the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ shall be referred to as a " _Merger
Consideration Adjustment_ ". Any issuance of stock made in respect of any
Merger Consideration Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes
unless otherwise required by any applicable Law.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Majority Stockholder a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing

Capital as of 11:59 pm on the day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Cash and Cash Equivalents held by the
Company as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Cash_ "), and (iii) the
aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company as of the Effective Time
(the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), in each case prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and to the extent in accordance with GAAP, the accounting principles,
policies, procedures, practices, applications and methodologies used in
preparing the Financial Statements, along with reasonable supporting detail
to evidence Parent's calculations, explanations and assumptions for the
calculation of such amounts.

  



  

(c) The Majority Stockholder shall have a period of thirty (30) days after
the date it receives the Preliminary Closing Statement from Parent to deliver
to Parent written notice of the Majority Stockholder's disagreement with any
item contained in the Preliminary Closing Statement, which notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "). During the thirty (30) day period following the Majority
Stockholder's receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement, Parent shall (i)
permit the Majority Stockholder and its accountants to consult with the
Company and Parent's accountants as reasonable, and (ii) provide to the
Majority Stockholder and its accountants reasonable access during
normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to all relevant
books and records relating to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Statement. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Parent, then the
Preliminary Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (A) or
(B) below) shall become the Final Closing Statement and become final and
binding upon the Parties on the earlier of the date (A) on which the Majority
Stockholder and Parent resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (B)
all matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm. During the sixty (60) days following Parent's receipt of a Notice of
Disagreement, Parent and the Majority Stockholder shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and upon such resolution, the Final
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of
Parent and the Majority Stockholder.

(d) If Parent and the Majority Stockholder are unable to resolve the disputed
items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement within fifteen (15) days
following Parent's receipt of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer
period as Parent and the Majority Stockholder may mutually agree in writing),
following notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be submitted to, and all
issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by, the dispute
resolution group of a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed
upon by Parent and the Majority Stockholder or, if Parent and the Majority
Stockholder cannot agree on an accounting firm within sixty (60) days after
timely delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, each of Parent and the Majority
Stockholder shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm and such two
(2) accounting firms shall designate the dispute resolution group of a third
nationally recognized accounting firm that neither presently is, nor in the
past three (3) years has been, engaged by either Party or any of their
respective Affiliates. The dispute resolution group of the accounting firm so
agreed to by Parent and the Majority Stockholder, or the dispute resolution
group of a third accounting firm so selected by the two (2) accounting firms,
acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Accounting Firm_ ". Parent and the Majority Stockholder shall submit to the
Accounting Firm, as experts and not as arbitrators, for review and
resolution all matters (but only such matters) that are set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement which remain in dispute. Parent and the
Majority Stockholder shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one (1) of
its partners experienced in purchase price adjustment disputes to make a
final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash and
Closing Indebtedness calculated with reference to the items that are in
dispute as set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. Parent and the Majority
Stockholder shall instruct the Accounting Firm that, in resolving Parent
items in the Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute and in
determining the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing
Indebtedness, the Accounting Firm shall (i) not assign to any item in dispute
a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by
Parent, on the one hand, or the Majority Stockholder, on the other hand, or
(B) less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one
hand, or the Majority Stockholder, on the other hand, (ii) make its
determination based on a review (which will be in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement) and a single written
presentation submitted by each of Parent and the Majority Stockholder and a
single written response of each of Parent and the Majority Stockholder to each
such presentation so submitted (iii) render a final resolution in writing to
Parent and the Majority Stockholder (which final resolution shall be
requested by Parent and the Majority Stockholder to be delivered not more than
thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters to the
Accounting Firm), which, absent manifest error, shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness, and (iv) provide a written report to
Parent and the Majority Stockholder, if requested by either of them, which
sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firm's final
determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by
the Company.

  



  

(e) The Preliminary Closing Statement (as adjusted by the agreement of the
Parties or at the direction of the Accounting Firm, as applicable) shall be
deemed final for the purposes of this _Section 2.9_ upon the earliest of the
(i) failure of the Stockholders' Representative to notify Parent of a dispute

Preliminary Closing Statement, (ii) resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
_Section 2.9(c)_ , by Parent and the Majority Stockholder, and (iii)

and Final Closing Indebtedness in accordance with _Section 2.9(c)_ or _Section

solely from the Working Capital Escrow Fund the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the lesser of (A) the remaining amount of the
Working Capital Escrow Fund, and (B) the Final Deficit, and Parent and the
Majority Stockholder shall promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing it to release such amount to Parent for
cancellation; and

  



  

   

-11-

 



    



  

(ii) if there is a Final Surplus, then Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, an amount of Parent Common
Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to such Final Surplus
_multiplied by_ the aggregate Pro Rata Percentages of the Company
Stockholders, which the Exchange Agent shall distribute to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

  



  

(g) If any shares of Parent Common Stock remain in the Working Capital Escrow
Fund after giving effect to the payments in _Section 2.9(f)_ , Parent and the
Majority Stockholder shall promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing it to release to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of
the Company Stockholders, the number whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to such remaining Working Capital Escrow Fund _multiplied by_ the aggregate

(h) The Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount
to be deposited in the Indemnification Escrow Fund and the Working Capital
Escrow Fund, respectively, shall be issued in the names of the Company
Stockholders (in restricted book entry form) in accordance with their

amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period which relate to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the

board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to Parent's stockholders
under applicable Law. Parent shall promptly, but in any event no later than 5
Business Days, notify the Company in writing of any final determination to
make a Change in Recommendation. Parent agrees that its obligation to

Section 10.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the

permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of the Parent Parties

respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations
of the Company under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to

reimbursement, cause of action or other right. Notwithstanding

the rights of the Equityholders to pursue damages in the event of a material
breach of this Agreement by any of the Parent Parties, in which event the
damages recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of the
Equityholders shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would
have been recoverable by the Equityholders if all such Equityholders brought
an action against the Parent Parties and were recognized as intended
third party beneficiaries hereunder.

Section 10.6 _Section Headings_. The Article and Section headings contained
in this Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part
of the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc._. Each Party hereby and any
Person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she
or it irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the
federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with
this _Section 10.7_ is pending before a court, all actions, suits or
proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute,
including any counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court. Each Party and any Person asserting
rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it hereby
waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any Legal Dispute, that (a) such
Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts
for any reason, (b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in such court, (c) such Party's property is exempt or immune
from execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or (e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is
improper. A final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this
_Section 10.7_ following the expiration of any period permitted for appeal
and subject to any stay during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Laws. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A
THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR
COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING
THERETO. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS
AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A
NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY
SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH
A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in entering into this
Agreement, such Party has not relied on any promises or assurances, written
or oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto) or the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge that the rights
of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique
and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may
have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that such non-
breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce its rights
and the other Party's obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions
for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security), including any order, injunction or decree sought by such non-
breaching Party to cause the other Party to perform its respective
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement. Each Party further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Amendment; Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time only by written agreement of the
Parties.

  



  

Section 10.13 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

Section 10.14 _Schedules_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement
in respect of which the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedules is not intended to imply that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of
such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein or
included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement or otherwise.

Section 10.15 _No Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Ancillary Agreements, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the Parties. No
Person who is not a Party, including any current, former or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any Party, or any current, former or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with,
or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach (other than as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements), and, to the
maximum extent permitted by Laws, each Party hereby waives and releases all
such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Laws (other than as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements), (a)
each Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or
causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or
granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Party or
otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether
granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b)
each Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect
to the performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

Section 10.17 _Indemnification and Survival_

  



  

(a) Parent and its officers, managers, members, employees, agents and
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) (each, a " _Parent Indemnitee_
") shall be entitled to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement with
respect of (1) any inaccuracies in, or any breach of, any representation or
warranty of the Company or the Majority Stockholder contained in this
Agreement (including any schedule or exhibit attached hereto), (2) the breach
or nonperformance of any covenant of the Majority Stockholder contained in
this Agreement (including any schedule or exhibit attached hereto), and (3)
the exercise of appraisal or dissenters rights by any Company Stockholder (it
being agreed that only Losses in excess of the amount such Person would have
received in respect of such Person's shares of Company Stock if such Person
had received such Person's portion of the final Merger Consideration in
respect thereof and not exercised such appraisal or dissenters rights shall
constitute a Loss), from the Indemnification Escrow Amount hereunder, from
and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, diminution in
value, penalties, fines, judgments, awards, settlements, Taxes, costs, fees,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and
costs) and disbursements (collectively, " _Losses_ "); provided, however,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than
in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, no Parent Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification under this _Section 10.17(a)_ against any Losses
(whether direct or indirect) if such Losses arise out of or result from, in
whole or in part, the Requisite Stockholders' approval of, or the execution,
filing or effectiveness of, the CoD Amendment.

  



  

(b) Parent shall compensate and reimburse the Equityholders from and against
any and all Losses, regardless of whether such Losses relate to any third
party claim, based upon, arising out of or otherwise relating to or in respect
of (i) any inaccuracies in any representation or warranty of the Parent
Parties contained in this Agreement (including any schedule or exhibit
attached hereto) or (ii) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or
agreement of the Parent Parties or the Surviving Company contained in this
Agreement (including any schedule or exhibit attached hereto).

  



  

   

-74-

 



    



  

(c) Each of the representations and warranties of the Company, the Parent
Parties and the Majority Stockholder contained in this Agreement (including
in any schedule or exhibit attached hereto) or in any Ancillary Agreement
shall survive the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby for a
period of twelve (12) months (the date that is last day of such twelve
(12)-month period, the " _Expiration Date_ "), after which no claim for
indemnification for the breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement (including any schedule or exhibit attached hereto) or in any
Ancillary Agreement may be brought _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
"Expiration Date" for any Liability Claim relating to a breach of the Parent
Fundamental Representations and the Company Fundamental Representations shall
be a period of seven (7) years, and (ii) any Liability Claim pending on the
applicable Expiration Date for which a Claims Notice has been given in
accordance with this _Section 10.17_ on or before such Expiration Date may
continue to be asserted and indemnified against until finally resolved. All of
the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (including any
schedule or exhibit attached hereto) shall survive until such covenants and
agreements are fully satisfied and require no performance or forbearance.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including any schedule or exhibit attached hereto), the following
limitations on indemnification shall apply:

  



  

(i) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 10.17(a)_ for any individual or series of related Losses which do
not exceed fifty thousand dollars $50,000 (which Losses shall not be counted
towards the other limits in this _Section 10.17(d)_ ).

  



  

(ii) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 10.17(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses of the
Parent Indemnitees exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Basket_
"), after which the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the full
amount of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket shall not
apply to any Losses with respect to any inaccuracies in, or any breach of, any
Company Fundamental Representation or any claim arising out of fraud criminal
activity or intentional representation.

  



  

(iii) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 10.17(a)_ in excess of the then-available Indemnification Escrow
Amount (the " _Cap_ "); provided that the Company Fundamental Representations
shall not be subject to the Cap.

  



  

(e) For the purposes of (i) determining whether there is an inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representation or warranty made by the Company or the Majority
Stockholder in this Agreement (including in any schedule or exhibit attached
hereto) or in any Ancillary Agreement and (ii) calculating the amount of
Losses in connection therewith, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect, "in
all material respects" or similar qualifications in such representation or
warranty the inclusion of which would limit or potentially limit the Losses
recoverable by the Parent Indemnitees hereunder shall be disregarded (as if
such words or phrases were deleted from such representation or warranty).

  



  

   

-75-

 



    



  

(f) In addition to any and all other remedies hereunder or at Law or in
equity, Parent shall be entitled to recover any monetary
indemnification payment, monetary payment or other specified monetary amounts
due to any Parent Indemnitee hereunder by retaining and setting off such
monetary amount (regardless of whether such monetary amount has been
liquidated or reduced to judgment) against any amounts due or to become due
from Parent or the Surviving Company to the Equityholders (or their
Affiliates) hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

(g) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Equityholders, on the one
hand, or a Parent Indemnitee, on the other hand, becomes aware of claim,
whether direct or from a third party claim, that such party has under _Section
10.17(a)_ that may result in a Loss (a " _Liability Claim_ "), such party
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give notice of such Liability Claim (a "
_Claims Notice_ ") to the other party (or to the Majority Stockholder, if the
Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnitee) (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). A
Claims Notice must describe the Liability Claim in reasonable detail and must
indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible) of
the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. No delay
in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 10.17(g)_ will adversely affect
any of the other rights or remedies that the Indemnified Party has under this
Agreement, or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party, in each case, except to the extent that such
