 (a) At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Person: 

   

       | (i)  |   | each share of Merger Sub common stock which
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one share of Interchange Common Stock;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | each share of Interchange Common Stock held
as Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be
issued in exchange therefore; and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | with the exception of Treasury Stock and the shares
of restricted Interchange Common Stock cancelled and paid for pursuant to
Section 3.3, each outstanding share of Interchange Common Stock which is
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall become and be
converted into the right to receive $23.00 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration").  
   

  

 3.2. _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (a) TD Banknorth shall appoint an agent, which shall be reasonably acceptable to Interchange (the "Exchange Agent"), for the purpose of exchanging certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Interchange Common Stock (the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) No later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or make available to each holder of record of a Certificate a notice and letter of transmittal reasonably satisfactory to Interchange disclosing 

    ##### 

  

    

the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for exchanging Certificates
for the Merger Consideration. Such letter of transmittal shall specify that
delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title shall pass only upon
proper delivery of Certificates to the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall deliver, or cause TD Banknorth, NA to deliver, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Certificates (other than the holders of Treasury Stock) an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to such holders of Certificates. 

   

 (d) Each holder of any outstanding Certificate (other than holders of Treasury Stock) who surrenders such Certificate to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding Certificate which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent shall, except as provided in Section 3.1, evidence ownership of only the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest. 

   

 (e) The Exchange Agent and TD Banknorth, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration until the holder surrenders a Certificate as provided in this Section 3.2, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably required in each case by the Exchange Agent or TD Banknorth. If any check is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a check in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by TD Banknorth or TD Banknorth, NA pursuant to Section 3.2(c) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of Interchange for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to TD Banknorth or TD Banknorth, NA, as applicable. Any shareholders of Interchange who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.2(d) shall thereafter look only to TD Banknorth for the Merger Consideration. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of TD Banknorth or TD Banknorth, NA, as applicable (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all Liens of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the Parties hereto shall be liable to any holder of Interchange Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. TD Banknorth, TD 

    ##### 

  

    

Banknorth, NA and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock
transfer books of Interchange to establish the identity of those persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. 

   

 (g) The Exchange Agent, TD Banknorth or TD Banknorth, NA shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any state, local or foreign tax law or regulation thereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, TD Banknorth or TD Banknorth, NA, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 3.3. _Interchange Stock Options and Other Equity Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Interchange Stock Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be terminated and the holder thereof shall be paid by Interchange immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of that option by (ii) the number of shares of Interchange Common Stock that the holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of that option) had that holder exercised that option immediately before the Effective Time, less applicable tax withholding. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unvested share of restricted Interchange Common Stock granted under the Interchange Stock Plans which is then outstanding shall be terminated and the holder thereof shall be paid by Interchange an amount equal to the Merger Consideration therefor. Subject to the foregoing, the Interchange Stock Plans and all Interchange Stock Options and other equity awards issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Interchange shall take such actions as may be necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3, including, without limitation, the provision of any notices to holders of Interchange Stock Options and other equity awards thereunder as may be provided for in the Interchange Stock Plans and the adoption of any necessary amendments to such plans.

Each of Interchange and TD Banknorth agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and related form of proxy to be cleared for use by Interchange under the Exchange Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. After the Proxy Statement and related form of proxy are cleared for use, Interchange shall promptly mail such materials to its shareholders. Interchange shall provide TD Banknorth a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, form of proxy and any other soliciting materials, in preliminary and definitive form, as well as any amendments or supplements thereto, prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and distribution of any such documents to shareholders of Interchange. 

  

 (b) Each of Interchange and TD Banknorth shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities and other third parties which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require TD Banknorth to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any conditions or restrictions, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities or other third parties that would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred to in Section 8.2(c). 

  

 (c) Interchange and TD Banknorth shall promptly inform each other of any material communication from, and shall give the other a reasonable opportunity to review in

advance any material communication intended to be given by it to, any
Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than any confidential portion thereof that relates solely to
the party receiving such communication from or providing such communication
to such Governmental Entity). 

   

 (d) Each of Interchange and TD Banknorth shall, upon request, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application to be made by or on behalf of any Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Interchange further agrees to cooperate with TD Banknorth and TD Banknorths counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the Proxy Statement and any other such statement, filing, notice or application. 

  

 Section 7.2. _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Interchange shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of TD Banknorth access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of Interchange and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, Interchange shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to TD Banknorth (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking, mortgage lending, real estate or consumer finance or protection laws (other than reports or documents which Interchange is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as TD Banknorth may reasonably request. Neither Interchange nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule or regulation applicable to the institution in possession or control of such information. Interchange and TD Banknorth shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

  

 (b) All information furnished to TD Banknorth by Interchange pursuant to Section 7.2(a) shall be subject to, and TD Banknorth shall hold all such information in accordance with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 27, 2006, between Interchange and TD Banknorth (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

  

 (c) No investigation by TD Banknorth or its respective Representatives shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Interchange set forth herein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.3. _Shareholder Approval_. 

  

 (a) Interchange shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable following the date hereof (the "Interchange Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Interchange Vote and, subject to Section 7.3(b), shall take all lawful action to solicit the approval of this Agreement by such shareholders. The Interchange Board shall recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of Interchange (the "Interchange Recommendation") and shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to TD Banknorth such recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement in connection with the Interchange Shareholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in Interchange Recommendation"), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7.3(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Interchange Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Interchange at the Interchange Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of approving this Agreement and nothing contained in this Section 7.3 or Section 7.4 shall be deemed to relieve Interchange of such obligation. In addition to the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement Interchange shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Required Interchange Vote, Interchange and the Interchange Board may effect a Change in Interchange Recommendation if and only to the extent that: 

  

       | (i)  |   | Interchange has complied in all material
respects with its obligations under Section 7.4,  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Interchange Board, after consultation with
its outside counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take
such action would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | Interchange or the Interchange Board (A)
has received an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from
a third party which the Interchange Board concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of
the adjustments which may be offered by TD Banknorth pursuant to clause
(C) below, (B) has notified TD Banknorth, at least five Business Days
in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in
Interchange Recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal and furnishing to TD Banknorth a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements, if such exist, with the Person
making such Superior Proposal and (C) during the period of not less than
five Business Days following Interchanges delivery of the notice referred
to in clause (B) above and prior to effecting such a Change in
Interchange Recommendation, has negotiated, and has used reasonable best
efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with TD
Banknorth in good faith (to the extent that TD Banknorth desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of  
    

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 7.4. _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) Interchange agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4(a), in the event that, prior to obtaining the Required Interchange Vote, Interchange receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and the Interchange Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, Interchange may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential information or data to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and participate in negotiations or discussions with such third party regarding such Acquisition Proposal to the extent that the Interchange Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that prior to providing (or causing to be provided) any confidential information or data permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, Interchange shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to Interchange than the terms of Section 7.2(b) hereof, and provided further that Interchange also shall provide to TD Banknorth a copy of any such confidential information or data that it is providing to any third party pursuant to this Section 7.4 to the extent not previously provided or made available to TD Banknorth. 

  

 (b) Interchange will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their employees, agents and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Person other than TD Banknorth with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce (and will not release any third party from its obligations under) any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential information previously furnished by Interchange thereunder and by using its reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions or other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. Interchange will promptly (within one Business Day) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal advise 

   ##### 

  

 

TD Banknorth of the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep TD Banknorth apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis (and, in any
event, within 48 hours of the occurrence of such developments, discussions
or negotiations). 

   

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Interchange or the Interchange Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement, and provided further that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Interchange Recommendation for purposes of Article IX hereof unless the Interchange Board expressly reaffirms the Interchange Recommendation in such disclosure. 

  

 (d) Interchange agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.4 by any director, officer, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained Representative) of Interchange or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent or prior Knowledge of Interchange or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.4 by Interchange. 

  

 Section 7.5. _Legal Conditions to the Merger_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Parties to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be obtained by any Party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that no Party shall be required to take any action pursuant to the foregoing sentence if the taking of such action or the obtaining of such consents, authorizations, orders, approvals or exemptions is reasonably likely to result in a condition or restriction having an effect of the type referred to in Section 8.2(c). 

  

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the proviso in Section 7.5(a)), each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) modify or amend any contracts, plans or arrangements to which it is a party (to the extent permitted by the terms thereof) if necessary in order to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in Article VIII hereof, (ii) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) defend any litigation 

   ##### 

  

 

seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeking material damages in connection therewith (in
which litigation Interchange shall provide TD Banknorth the reasonable
opportunity to participate). 

   

 Section 7.6. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of Interchange or a Subsidiary of Interchange, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including any amounts paid in a settlement effected with the prior written consent of TD Banknorth) incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of Interchange or, while a director, officer or employee of Interchange, is or was serving at the request of Interchange as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the Interchange Certificate as of the date hereof (which right to indemnification shall include the advancement of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt from an Indemnified Party of any required undertaking). 

  

 (b) Without limitation of the foregoing, TD Banknorth agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties in the respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of Interchange or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Effective Time, provided, that nothing contained in this Section 7.6(b) shall be deemed to preclude any liquidation, consolidation or merger of TD Banknorth or any of its Subsidiaries, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation or merger. In any case in which approval by TD Banknorth, one of its Subsidiaries or the board of directors thereof is required to effect any indemnification, at the election of the Indemnified Party, the determination of any such approval shall be made by a majority of the independent directors then in office or, if no such directors are then in office, by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between TD Banknorth and the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.6, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify TD Banknorth, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve TD Banknorth of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices TD Banknorth. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) TD Banknorth shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and TD Banknorth shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal 

   ##### 

  

 

expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if TD
Banknorth elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between TD Banknorth and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to TD Banknorth, and TD
Banknorth shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) TD
Banknorth and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate reasonably in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) TD Banknorth shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) TD Banknorth
shall have no obligation hereunder to the extent that indemnification of
an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations or by an applicable federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the persons serving as directors and officers of Interchange immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Interchange (provided that TD Banknorth may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing comparable terms and conditions as such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to Interchanges existing coverage limits and which is not less advantageous to such directors and officers) for a six-year period following the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall TD Banknorth be required to expend for any one year more than an amount equal to 200% of the current annual amount expended by Interchange to maintain such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if TD Banknorth is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.6(d) as a result of the preceding provision, TD Banknorth shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. 

  

 (e) If after the Effective Time TD Banknorth or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of TD Banknorth shall assume the obligations of TD Banknorth set forth in this Section 7.6 and under Section 7.10. 

  

 (f) Following the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall not knowingly take, directly or indirectly, any action that would or would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of TD Banknorth to fulfill its obligations under this Section 7.6 or under Section 7.10. 

  

 (g) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 Section 7.7. _Advice of Changes_. Each of Interchange and TD Banknorth shall promptly advise the other of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 

   ##### 

  

 

Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to
cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein, provided, however, that
any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the failure to be
satisfied of a condition set forth in Article VIII or give rise to any right
of termination under Article IX unless the underlying breach shall
independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right. 

   

 Section 7.8. _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than 20 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, Interchange shall furnish to TD Banknorth (a) consolidated and consolidating financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and stockholders equity) of Interchange and each of its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period and (c) any reports provided to the Interchange Board or any committee thereof relating to the financial and risk performance of Interchange. In addition, Interchange shall furnish TD Banknorth with a copy of each report filed by Interchange or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Entity within three Business Days following the filing thereof. All information furnished by Interchange to TD Banknorth pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall be held in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.9. _Transition Matters_. 

  

 (a) Commencing following the date hereof, TD Banknorth and Interchange shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of the businesses and operating systems of Interchange and its Subsidiaries with those of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Interchange and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with U.S. GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of TD Banknorth, provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b); and provided further that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by Interchange or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.9(b) shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of Interchange or its management with any such adjustments. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Interchange agrees to complete the liquidation and dissolution of Clover Leaf Mortgage Company and any other inactive direct or indirect Subsidiary of Interchange as may be requested by TD Banknorth not less than 30 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall take all reasonable action so that employees of Interchange and its Subsidiaries who become employees of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") shall be entitled to participate, effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each TD Banknorth employee benefit plan of general applicability (collectively, the "TD Banknorth Benefit Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of Interchange and its Subsidiaries in the TD Banknorth Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans and that any grants to any former employee of Interchange or its Subsidiaries under any equity compensation plan of TD Banknorth shall be discretionary with TD Banknorth). To the extent that Continuing Employees are not entitled to participate in any TD Banknorth Benefit Plan effective as of the Effective Time, such employees shall continue to participate in the corresponding employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Interchange and its Subsidiaries so as to ensure that there is not a lapse in participation or coverage (but in no event to provide duplicate participation or coverage), as applicable, prior to participation in such TD Banknorth Benefit Plan, provided that in no event shall TD Banknorth be required to continue any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Interchange for which there is no corresponding TD Banknorth Benefit Plan. TD Banknorth shall cause each TD Banknorth Benefit Plan in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the TD Banknorth Benefit Plans (other than for benefit accruals under TD Banknorths defined benefit pension plan, supplemental retirement plan and supplemental retirement agreements) the service of such employees with Interchange and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited generally for such purpose by Interchange and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. TD Banknorth shall assume and honor the accrued but unused vacation and sick time of the Continuing Employees at the Effective Time under the applicable policies of Interchange, as set forth on Section 7.10(a) of the Interchange Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (b) If Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, health or disability plan of TD Banknorth or its Subsidiaries, TD Banknorth shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, dental or disability plans of TD Banknorth and are covered under the applicable medical, health, dental or disability plans of Interchange, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, unless such employee had not yet satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Interchange Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) An employee of TD Banknorth or any of its Subsidiaries who was an employee of Interchange or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any employee who is party to an employment agreement, change-in-control 

   ##### 

  

 

agreement or any other agreement which provides for severance payments) whose
employment is terminated during the one-year period following the Effective
Time shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance with, and
to the extent provided in, the severance plan for Interchange adopted by TD
Banknorth in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (a copy of
which Interchange acknowledges has been delivered to it). 

   

 (d) As of the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of TD Banknorth to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all Interchange Benefit Plans, including all written employment, termination, severance, change in control and other compensation agreements, existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement which have been disclosed in Section 4.11(a) of the Interchange Disclosure Schedule, except as otherwise provided in the agreements referred to in Section 7.10(i) below. TD Banknorth acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a "Change in Control" for purposes of the Interchange Benefit Plans. 

  

 (e) With respect to each Interchange Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code, Interchange agrees to amend each such plan or cause each such plan to be amended to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code (or to cause such plan, in whole or in part, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the Code by preserving the terms of such plan, and the law in effect, for benefits earned and vested as of December 31, 2004) prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the deadline imposed by the IRS. Such amendments shall be provided to TD Banknorth and its counsel at least ten days prior to their proposed adoption by Interchange or Interchange Bank and shall be subject to the prior approval of TD Banknorth, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.10, nothing contained in this Section 7.10 shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any Interchange Benefit Plan, TD Banknorth Benefit Plan or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings in accordance with their terms and applicable law, provided that no such amendment, modification or termination shall reduce or eliminate a vested benefit. 

  

 (g) Interchange shall cooperate in providing information reasonably requested by TD Banknorth that is necessary for TD Banknorth to prepare and distribute notices that TD Banknorth may desire prior to the Effective Time under the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988. 

  

 (h) For a period of six months following the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall make available (through written notice or its website) to employees of Interchange and its Subsidiaries whose employment was terminated at or following the Effective Time other than for cause, disability or retirement, and who requests to be so notified, of opportunities for positions with TD Banknorth or any of its Subsidiaries for which TD Banknorth reasonably believes such persons are qualified and shall consider any application submitted by such persons, provided, however, that any decision to offer employment to any such person shall be made in the sole discretion of TD Banknorth. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, (i) Interchange and TD Banknorth shall enter into a Termination and Release Agreement with each of Anthony S. Abbate, Anthony J. Labozzetta, Patricia D. Arnold, Charles T. Field and Frank R. Giancola substantially in the form set forth in Section 7.10(i)(x) of the Interchange Disclosure Schedule and (ii) TD Banknorth shall enter into a Consulting and Noncompetition Agreement with Anthony S. Abbate substantially in the form set forth in Section 7.10(i)(y) of the Interchange Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Related Agreements").

Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement all references to "dollars" or "$" are to United States dollars. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation. 

   

 Section 10.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

   

 Section 10.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and the disclosure schedules hereto and the other documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_  

   

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal law are applicable). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, for any action, proceeding or investigation in any court or before any governmental authority ("Litigation") arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, the defense of sovereign immunity, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 10.7, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by 

    ##### 

  

    

applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or
delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is
entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such Litigation by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail. 

   

 (c) Each Party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each Party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each Party makes this waiver voluntarily and (d) each Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.7(c). 

   

 Section 10.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party or its shareholders. Upon any such determination, Interchange and TD Banknorth shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties. 

   

 Section 10.9. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of Interchange or TD Banknorth hereunder shall be assigned by Interchange or TD Banknorth (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder other than with respect to the provisions of Section 7.6, which shall inure to the benefit of the directors and officers of Interchange referred to therein and their respective heirs and personal representatives, who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 10.10. _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, TD Banknorth may at any time change the structure of the Merger and/or the Bank Merger, provided that in any such case no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (ii) materially increase the overall amount of federal, state or local taxes resulting from the Merger or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger. In the event TD Banknorth elects to make such a change, the Parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change. 

    ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective officers hereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.

be permitted: (i) transfers by will or operation of law, in which case this
Agreement shall bind the transferee, subject to applicable law, (ii)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iii) transfers

relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee

transfers to any other shareholder of Interchange who has executed a copy of
this Agreement on the date hereof with respect to some or all of the Shares
held by such shareholder, and (vi) such transfers as TD Banknorth may

violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void. 

   

 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with TD Banknorth as follows: 

   

 A. _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 B. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles. 

   

 C. _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder. 

   

 D. _Ownership of Shares_. Shareholder (or an affiliate of shareholder) has good title to all of the Shares as of the date hereof, and, except as set forth on Annex I hereto, the Shares are so owned free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other encumbrances. 

   

 4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to TD Banknorth if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, TD Banknorth will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that TD Banknorth has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with TD 

   ##### 

  

   

Banknorths seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after
discussing the matter with Shareholder, TD Banknorth shall have the right to
inform any third party that TD Banknorth reasonably believes to be, or to
be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from
Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this
Agreement and of the rights of TD Banknorth hereunder, and that participation
by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of
Shareholders agreement with TD Banknorth set forth in this Agreement may
give rise to claims by TD Banknorth against such third party. 

   

 5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. 

   

 A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. 

   

 B. This Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time of the Merger or the earlier of (i) at any time prior to consummation of the Merger by the written consent of the parties hereto and (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. 

   

 6\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. No party hereto may assign any rights or obligations hereunder to any other person, except as required by Section 2 or upon the prior written consent of each other party. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   

 7\. _Notices_. Notices may be provided to TD Banknorth and the Shareholder in the manner specified in the Merger Agreement, with all notices to the Shareholder being provided to him or her at the address set forth in Annex I hereto. 

   

 8\. _Miscellaneous_. 

   

 A. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or application shall be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid or unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and the remainder of this Agreement, shall not be affected.

   ##### 

  

   

shall apply to Shareholder in his or her capacity as a director, officer
or employee of Interchange or in any other fiduciary capacity. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any
manner, the obligations of the Shareholder to comply with his or her
fiduciary duties as a director of Interchange. 

   

 C. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

   

 D. _Headings_. All Section headings herein are for convenience of reference only and are not part of this Agreement, and no construction or reference shall be derived therefrom. 

   

 E. _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made under, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of law principles.
