The Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided in the DGCL, except that Article I thereof shall be amended in the Merger to read in its entirety as follows: "The name of the Corporation is Veridian Corporation."

ARTICLE 3   

CONVERSION OF SHARES 

  

 3.1 Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Target or any holder of Target Capital Stock:   

 (a) Each of the shares of the Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share of Target (the _" _Target Common Stock_ "_) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Target Common Stock held in the treasury of Target or by any Subsidiary of Target) shall be converted into the right to receive $35.00 (the _" _Merger Consideration_ "_) payable upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Target Common Stock. All shares of Target Common Stock when converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a Target Certificate (as defined in _Section 3.4(e)_) will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive such Merger Consideration. In the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the    ##### 

  

Effective Time,the outstanding shares of Target Common Stock are changed into
a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration will be adjusted to reflect such change.   

 (b) Any Target Common Stock held in the treasury of Target and any Target Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist.   

 (c) The terms of each outstanding option to purchase shares of Target Common Stock under any employee or director stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of Target (the _" _Target Employee Stock Options_ "_) that is outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any plans related thereto), shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, such Target Employee Stock Options shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive, in full satisfaction of such Target Employee Stock Options, cash from Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to (X) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of each such Target Employee Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to adjustment pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 3.1(a)_ ) multiplied by (Y) the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable pursuant to such Target Employee Stock Option as of the Effective Time (in each case whether or not such Stock Option had been fully vested and fully exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time), which cash payment will be treated as compensation and will be net of any applicable federal or state withholding taxes.   

 (d) Each warrant to purchase shares of Target Common Stock (the _" _Target Warrants_ "_) which is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive, in full satisfaction of such Target Warrant, cash from Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to (X) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Target Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to adjustment pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 3.1(a)_) multiplied by (Y) the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable pursuant to such Target Warrant as of the Effective Time.   

 3.2 Acquisition Sub Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror as the sole shareholder of Acquisition Sub, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Acquisition Sub ( _" _Acquistion Sub Common Stock_ "_) shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share of Surviving Corporation.   

 3.3 Dissenting Shares. Target Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Target Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL (the _" _Dissenting Shares_ "_) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, in which case such shares of Target Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger    ##### 

   

Consideration. Target shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any demands
received by Target for appraisal of shares of Target Common Stock,
and Acquiror shall have the right to participate fully in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, Target shall not make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares under the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, will receive payment thereof from the
Surviving Corporation and such shares of Target Common Stock will no longer
be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease
to exist.   

 3.4 Surrender and Payment.   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each record holder of a Target Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon surrender thereof to a paying agent reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and Target (the _" _Paying Agent_ "_),a check payable to the order of such holder or, at the election of such holder, a funds transfer via the Federal Reserve System Fedwire, in the amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.   

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) until holders or transferees of Target Certificates have surrendered them for exchange as provided herein, no dividends or Merger Consideration shall be paid with respect to any shares represented by such Target Certificates and (ii) without regard to when such Target Certificates are surrendered for exchange as provided herein, no interest shall be paid on any dividends or any portion of the Merger Consideration.   

 (c) If any payment for shares of Target Common Stock is to be made in a name other than the name in which the Target Certificate surrendered for payment therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the surrendered certificate be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting payment either (i) pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the surrendered certificate or (ii) establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   

 (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall make available to the Paying Agent the cash required to effect the payments referred to in  _Section 3.4(a)_ above.   

 (e) Within two business days following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Target Common Stock (the _" _Target Certificates_ "_) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Target Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Target Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Target Certificates in exchange for cash. Upon surrender of Target Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent shall reasonably require, the holder of record of such Target Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check or wire transfer in payment of the consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1, and the Target Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled.    ##### 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Target Common Stock for any
portion of the consideration delivered to a public official as required by
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   

 (f) Promptly following the date which is nine months after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Acquiror all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Target Certificate may surrender such Target Certificate to Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Acquiror, the Acquisition Sub, Target or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder of Target Common Stock for any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws.   

 (g) In the event any Target Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Target Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and provided Targets records indicate such person is the registered owner of the related Target Common Stock, Surviving Corporation shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Target Certificate the aggregate Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with this _Article 3._ When authorizing such payment in exchange therefor, the Secretary of Surviving Corporation may, in his discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Target Certificate to give Surviving Corporation such indemnity as he may reasonably direct as protection against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Target Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

 3.5 Closing. The closing (the _" _Closing_ "_) of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at the offices of Andrews and Kurth L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., or such other location as shall be mutually agreeable to Acquiror and Target on the third business day immediately following the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ is fulfilled or waived, or at such other time and place as Acquiror and Target shall agree (the date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the _" _Closing Date_ "_).   

 3.6 Closing of Targets Transfer Books. At and after the Effective Time, holders of Target Certificates shall cease to have any rights as Stockholders, except for the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration into which the shares of Target Common Stock evidenced by such Target Certificate were converted, as contemplated by _Section 3.1._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Target shall be closed and no transfers of shares of Target Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Target Certificates formerly representing Target Common Stock are presented to Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the aggregate Merger Consideration into which the shares of Target Common Stock evidenced by such Target Certificate were converted, in accordance with this _Article 3,_ provided that the Target Certificate is surrendered as provided in _Section 3.4_ and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer (including evidence of payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes).    ##### 

 

 3.7 Withholding. Acquiror will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Target Common Stock all amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld therefrom. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Target Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub.   

ARTICLE 4   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ACQUIROR AND ACQUISITION SUB

Each of Acquiror and Acquisition Sub is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing will not, when taken together with all other such failures, have a Material Adverse Effect.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Target, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of Acquiror and Acquisition Sub enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) general equitable principles.   

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub do not violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in   #####

right of termination or acceleration under, or give rise to any obligation to
make payments or provide compensation under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) the
respective charters, by-laws, partnership agreements, trust declarations, or
other similar organizational instruments of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of any court or
Governmental Entity applicable to Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets or (iii) any note, bond, mortgage,

lease, partnership agreement, joint venture agreement or other instrument,
obligation or agreement of any kind to which Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected. The
consummation by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in any violation, conflict, breach,
termination, acceleration or creation of any Liens under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the
preceding sentence, subject, in the case of the terms, conditions
or provisions described in clause (ii) above, to obtaining (prior to the
Effective Time) the Acquiror Required Statutory Approvals. There are no
consents required from commercial lenders, lessors or other third parties and
all material violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
accelerations, payments, compensations or creations of Liens referred to in
the foregoing sentences of this paragraph (b). Excluded from the foregoing
sentences of this paragraph (b), insofar as they apply to the terms,
conditions or provisions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first
sentence of this paragraph (b), and from the preceding sentence, are such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations,
payments, compensations or creations of Liens, that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
or materially impair Acquirors ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.   

 (c) Except for Acquiror Required Statutory Approvals, no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror or Acquisition Sub or the consummation by Acquiror or Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated thereby. Excluded from the foregoing sentence are such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made or obtained, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair Acquirors ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   

 4.3 Litigation. Other than matters existing or arising under Regulatory Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are to be dealt with as provided in _Section 6.5,_ there are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against, relating to or affecting Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator that seek to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Merger. Except as set forth in the initial clause of the preceding sentence, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any arbitrator,   ##### 

   

which prohibits or restricts the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 4.4 No Acquiror Stockholders Approval Required. There is no requirement of any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment of any governmental or regulatory body or authority (including, without limitation, any exchange upon which securities of Acquiror are publicly traded) which requires the approval or adoption by the shareholders of Acquiror of this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 4.5 Investment Intent. Acquiror has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of acquisition of the Target Common Stock. Acquiror confirms that Target has made available to Acquiror the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management employees of Target and to acquire all information Acquiror desires about the business and financial condition of Target. The Target Common Stock is being acquired by Acquiror pursuant to the Merger for the account of Acquiror, with no intention of distributing or reselling such stock or any part thereof, and Acquiror will not distribute or resell such stock or any part thereof, in any manner or transaction which would be in violation of the Securities Act or the securities law of any state.   

 4.6 Financial Capability. Acquiror has the financial capacity to perform and to cause Acquisition Sub to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement, and Acquiror has currently available all funds necessary to pay the consideration set forth in _Article 3_ and any other amounts contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Acquirors ability to consummate and to cause Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is not contingent on Acquirors ability to complete any public offering or private placement of equity or debt securities or to obtain any other type of financing prior to or on the Closing Date.   

 4.7 No Additional Representations. Target acknowledges that neither Acquiror nor Acquisition Sub, nor any other person or entity acting on behalf of Acquiror, Acquisition Sub, or any Affiliate of Acquiror or Acquisition Sub has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Acquiror or Acquisition Sub, in each case, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.   

ARTICLE 5   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET 

  

 Except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Schedule of Target attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (the " _ _Target Disclosure Schedule__ "), Target represents and warrants to Acquiror and Acquisition Sub as follows:   

 5.1 Organization and Qualification. Target is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Target is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to    ##### 

   

be so qualified and in good standing will not, when taken together with all
other such failures, have a Material Adverse Effect. True, accurate and
complete copies of Targets certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each
case as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments thereto, have
heretofore been delivered to Acquiror or are otherwise publicly available
through the EDGAR system.   

 5.2 Capitalization.   

 (a) The authorized capital stock of Target consists of 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.0001 par value per share, none of which are currently issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, and 130,000,000 shares of common stock, $.0001 par value per share, 34,816,350 of which were issued and outstanding as of June 7, 2003. All of such issued and outstanding shares are validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.   

 (b) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, calls, contracts, commitments, understandings, restrictions, arrangements, stock appreciation rights (SARs), phantom stock, rights or warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or other agreement and also including any rights plan or other anti-takeover agreement, obligating Target to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of Target Capital Stock, or obligating Target to grant, extend or enter into any such agreement or commitment. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings to which Target is a party or is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of Target Capital Stock. As of Closing, the terms of the agreements evidencing the Target Employee Stock Options and the Target Warrants will permit the actions contemplated by _Section 3.1(c)_ and _Section 3.1(d),_ respectively.   

 (c) The Board of Directors of Target has not declared any dividend or distribution with respect to the Target Common Stock the record or payment date for which is on or after the date of this Agreement.   

 (d) As of the date hereof, (i) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Target having the right to vote are issued or outstanding, and (ii) there are no outstanding contractual obligations of Target or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Target or any of its Subsidiaries.   

 (e) The Target Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. No other securities of Target or any of its Subsidiaries are listed or quoted for trading on any United States domestic or foreign securities exchange.   

 5.3 Subsidiaries.   

 (a) Each Subsidiary of Target is a corporation duly incorporated or an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, has all corporate, partnership or other entity derived powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not, individually or in the   ##### 

   

aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of Target is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or entity, as the case may
be, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Subsidiary of Target is in default in any respect in the
performance, observation or fulfillment of any provision of its articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents). Other than its
Subsidiaries, Target does not beneficially own or control, directly or
indirectly, 5% or more of any class of equity or similar securities of any
corporation or other organization whether incorporated or
unincorporated.   

 (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of Target is owned by Target, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any other limitation or restriction (including, without limitation, any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests), other than any restrictions imposed under the Securities Act. There are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any of Targets Subsidiaries, (ii) securities of Target or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any of Targets Subsidiaries or (iii) options or other rights to acquire from Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of Target or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, any of Targets Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding obligations of Target or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the securities referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this _Section 5.3(b)._   

 5.4 Authority; Non-Contravention; Approval.   

 (a) Target has full corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the Stockholders Approval and the Target Required Statutory Approvals, to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors of Target has adopted resolutions approving this Agreement, determining that the Merger is in the best interests of Targets Stockholders, and recommending that the Stockholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, and such resolutions shall be in force and effect and neither rescinded nor superseded prior to or as of the Closing Date. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Target are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or, except for the Stockholders Approval, the consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated hereby. Target has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of Target enforceable against Target in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) general equitable principles.   

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target does not violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of,   ##### 

  

or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or give rise to any obligation to make
payments or provide compensation under, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Target under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of (i) the respective charters, by-laws, partnership
agreements, trust declarations, or other similar organizational instruments
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)any statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of
any court or governmental authority applicable to Target or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (iii) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit,
concession, contract, lease, partnership agreement, joint venture agreement
or other instrument, obligation or agreement of any kind to which Target or
any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Target or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected. The consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in any violation, conflict, breach, termination,
acceleration or creation of Liens under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence,
subject (A) in the case of the terms, conditions or provisions described in
clause (ii) above, to obtaining (prior to the Effective Time) Target Required
Statutory Approvals and the Stockholders Approval and (B) in the case of the
terms, conditions or provisions described in clause (iii) above, to obtaining
(prior to the Effective Time) consents required from lessors or other third
parties. Excluded from the foregoing sentences of this paragraph (b), insofar
as they apply to the terms, conditions or provisions described in clauses
(ii) and (iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph (b) are such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations,
payments, compensations or creations of Liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
or materially impair Targets ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.   

 (c) Except for Target Required Statutory Approvals, no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental or regulatory body or authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target or the consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated thereby. Excluded from the foregoing sentence are such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made or obtained, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair Targets ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   

 (d) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Target Common Stock (the __"Stockholders  Approval"_) _is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Targets capital stock necessary to approve the Merger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 5.5 SEC Documents.   

 (a) Target has previously delivered (except to the extent such filings are publicly available on the EDGAR system) to Acquiror each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than preliminary materials) filed by Target with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( _" _SEC_ "_) since January 1, 2002, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, and    ##### 

  

Target has timely filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC pursuant to relevant securities statutes,
regulations, policies and rules since such time (collectively, the _" _Target
Reports_ "_). As of their respective dates, the Target Reports (i) were
prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder
and complied with the then applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included
in the Target Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Target and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity included in the
Target Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in
all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholders equity, as the case may be, of Target and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in the case of unaudited statements, for year-end audit
adjustments and as otherwise may be noted therein.   

 (b) Target maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning Target and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Targets filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents.   

 5.6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Target did not have at December 31, 2002, nor, to the knowledge of Target, has it incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except liabilities, obligations or contingencies which (a) are disclosed in the Target Reports, (b) were incurred after December 31, 2002 in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, (c) could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (d) have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date hereof. Target has not been a party to any securitization transactions or "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act) at any time since January 1, 1999.   

 5.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in or contemplated by this Agreement or the Target Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2002, Target has not suffered or experienced any Material Adverse Effect and has not engaged in any material transaction of a kind that would be prohibited after the date hereof pursuant to _Section 6.1._   

 5.8 Litigation. Other than matters existing or arising under Regulatory Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are to be dealt with as provided in _Section 6.5,_ there are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Target, threatened against, relating to or affecting Target before any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator that seek to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or seek other relief or remedy and which could reasonably be expected, either alone or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions or proceedings not otherwise disclosed in _Section 5.8_ of the Target Disclosure Schedule, to have    ##### 

   

a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the initial clause of the
preceding sentence, neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any
arbitrator, which prohibits or restricts the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or which could reasonably be expected, either
alone or in the aggregate with all judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or
orders, to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

 5.9 No Violation of Law. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or has been given notice or been charged with any violation of, any law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment of any governmental or regulatory body or authority, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Target and its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations of and registrations with and under all laws, and from all Governmental Entities, required by Target and its Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to have such permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations and registrations, individually or in the aggregate with such other failures not otherwise disclosed in _Section 5.9_ of the Target Disclosure Schedule, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

 5.10 Compliance with Agreements. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or violation of or in default in the performance or observance of any term or provision of, and no event has occurred which, with lapse of time or action by a third party, could result in a default under, (a) the charter and by-laws of Target or (b) the contracts, commitments, agreements, leases, licenses, and other instruments specifically disclosed in the Target Reports (the _" _Material Contracts_ "_) or _Section 5.16_ of the Target Disclosure Schedule, except, in the case of clause (b) above, for breaches, violations and defaults which, alone or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

 5.11 Taxes.   

 (a) Target and its Subsidiaries have (i) duly filed with the appropriate governmental authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed for all periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time, and for which a tax return is required by applicable law to be filed on or prior to such Effective Time (including pursuant to extensions properly obtained), and such filed Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects, (ii) duly paid in full or made adequate provision for the payment of all Taxes for all periods ending at or prior to December 31, 2002 and (iii) duly withheld and paid all Taxes required by applicable law to have been withheld and paid as of the Effective Time in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, or other third party. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where any of Target or its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The liabilities and reserves for Taxes reflected in the balance sheet included in the Target Reports as of and for the period ended December 31, 2002 are adequate to cover all Taxes of Target and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending at or prior to the date of such balance sheet and there are no material Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of either of Target or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due. No audit or administrative or judicial Tax proceeding is pending or being conducted with respect to Target or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Target nor any Subsidiary has received any notice    ##### 

  

indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, a request for
information related to Tax matters, or notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted or assessed. Target has
delivered to Acquiror correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax
Returns filed for 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, if filed, and for all other open
years. There are no unresolved issues of law or fact which, to the knowledge
of Target, exist or which arise out of a notice of deficiency, proposed
deficiency or assessment from the Internal Revenue Service or any other
governmental taxing authority with respect to Taxes of Target or
its Subsidiaries. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency other than waivers
and extensions which are no longer in effect. Neither Target nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement providing for the allocation
or sharing of Taxes with any entity that is not, directly or indirectly, a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Target. Excluded from this _Section 5.11_ are any
Taxes, Tax Returns or other matters pertaining to Taxes of Target which,
alone or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   

 (b) Neither Target nor any Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code §280G, or (ii) any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of Code §162(m).   

 5.12 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.   

 (a) The Target Disclosure Schedule lists all material compensation and employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and practices, including employee benefit plans within the meaning set forth in section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Target (the _" _Target Plans_ "_), or to which it makes or is obligated to make contributions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (the _" _Union Plans_ "_). No Target Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or section 412 of the Code.   

 (b) There have been no prohibited transactions within the meaning of section 406 or section 407 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code with respect to any of the Target Plans that could result in penalties, taxes or liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a Material Adverse Effect. No liability has been or is expected to be incurred under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any of the Union Plans. Each of the Target Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable laws and agreements during the period of time covered by the applicable statute of limitations, to the extent any such failure could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Target Plans which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified. To the knowledge of Target, there are no material pending, threatened or anticipated claims involving any of the Target Plans other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course. To the knowledge of Target, all contributions required to have been made to the Target Plans and the Union Plans by Target have been made.   

 5.13 Labor. There are no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of Target, threatened between Target or any of its Subsidiaries and any representatives of any of their employees. To the knowledge of Target, there are no organizational efforts presently being made involving any of the presently unorganized employees of Target or its Subsidiaries and no    ##### 

  

executive or key employee or group of employees of Target has any plan to
terminate his or her employment with Target. Target and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all laws relating to employment and labor, including, without
limitation, any provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, collective
bargaining and the payment of social security and similar Taxes. No person
has asserted that Target or any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any arrears
of wages or any Taxes or penalties for failure to comply with any of such
laws. Excluded from the foregoing sentences of this _Section 5.13_ are
controversies, organizational efforts, non-compliance and liabilities which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   

 5.14 Real Estate.   

 (a) The Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth the address of all material real property owned by Target or any Subsidiary of Target as of the date hereof (the __"Owned Real Property_ "_). Target or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, holds good and marketable title to the Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens except for (i) Liens for current Taxes or assessments that are not yet delinquent, (ii) builder, mechanic, warehousemen, materialmen, contractor, workmen, repairmen, carrier or other similar Liens arising and continuing in the ordinary course of business for obligations that are not yet delinquent, (iii) the rights, if any, of vendors having possession of tooling of Target and its Subsidiaries, (iv) liens arising from the receipt by Target and its Subsidiaries of progress payments by the United States government, (v) Liens securing rental payments under capital lease arrangements and (vi) other Liens which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

 (b) The Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth the address of all material real property in which Target or any Subsidiary of Target holds a leasehold or subleasehold estate (the __"Leased Real Property_ "_; the leases or subleases for such Leased Real Property being referred to as the __"Leases"__ ). With respect to each of the Leases: (i) Target or such Subsidiary, as applicable, holds good and marketable title to the leasehold interest thereunder; and (ii) neither Target nor any Subsidiary has assigned, subleased, mortgaged, deeded in trust or otherwise transferred or encumbered such Lease, or any interest therein.   

 5.15 Environmental Matters. Target and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, having all permits, licenses and other approvals and authorizations necessary for the operation of their business as presently conducted. None of the properties currently or, to the knowledge of Target, formerly owned or operated by Target and its Subsidiaries contain any Hazardous Substance in amounts exceeding the levels permitted by applicable Environmental Laws. Target and its Subsidiaries have not received any notices, demand letters or requests for information from any Governmental Entity or third party, which has not heretofore been resolved with such Governmental Entity or third party, indicating that Target or any of its Subsidiaries may be in violation of, or liable under, any Environmental Law. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or to the knowledge of Target, threatened against Target or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any violation, or alleged violation, of any Environmental Law. No reports have been filed, or are required to be filed, by Target or any of its Subsidiaries concerning the release of any Hazardous Substance or the threatened or actual violation of any Environmental Law which have not   ##### 

  

heretofore been resolved. No Hazardous Substance has been disposed of,
released or transported in violation of any applicable Environmental Law from
any properties owned by Target or any of its Subsidiaries. No remediation or
investigation of Hazardous Substances is occurring at any property owned or
operated, or formerly owned or operated, by Target or any of its
Subsidiaries. Target and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
properties are not subject to any liabilities or expenditures (fixed or
contingent) relating to any suit, settlement, court order, administrative
order, regulatory requirement, judgment or claim asserted or arising under
any Environmental Law. Excluded from this _Section 5.15_ are any violations
or conditions that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

 5.16 Contracts and Commitments. Except for the Material Contracts, neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by: (a) any agreements with any present Stockholder, employee, officer or director (or former stockholder, employee, officer or director to the extent there remain at the date hereof obligations to be performed by Target or any of its Subsidiaries); (b) any material agreements with a consultant or sales representative not terminable upon 30 days written notice; (c) agreements or indentures relating to the borrowing of money having a remaining principal balance on the date hereof in an amount exceeding $1,000,000; (d) any joint venture or profit-sharing agreement; (e) contracts, not entered into in the ordinary course of business on an arms-length basis, that are material to Target; (f) any collective bargaining agreements, memoranda or understanding, settlements or other labor agreements with any union or labor organization applicable to Target, its Affiliates or their employees; (g) any agreements or arrangements for the acquisition or sale of any business of Target entered into since January 1, 2001 or any such agreement or arrangement, regardless of when such agreement or arrangement was entered into, that has not yet been consummated; (h) any agreement which imposes non-competition or non-solicitation restrictions other than any organizational conflict of interest prohibition, restriction, representation, warranty, or notice provision or any other restriction on future contracting set forth in Targets Government Contracts; (i) any employment, severance or other similar agreement which contains a change of control or "golden parachute" provision; and (j) any other agreements to which Target or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or any of their assets are bound and which involves consideration or other obligation in excess of $10,000,000 annually.   

 5.17 Intellectual Property Rights.   

 (a) To the knowledge of Target, (i) Target and its Subsidiaries own all right, title and interest in or have valid and enforceable rights to use, by license or other agreement, all of the Intellectual Property Rights that are currently used in the conduct of Targets or any of its Subsidiarys business, free of all liens, pledges, charges, options, rights of first refusal, security interests or other encumbrances of any kind, (ii) no action, claim, arbitration, proceeding, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation or suit (whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or informal) has commenced, been brought or heard by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator or is pending or is threatened in writing by any third Person with respect to any Intellectual Property Rights owned or used by Target or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with their respective businesses as currently conducted, including any of the foregoing that alleges that the operation of any such business infringes, misappropriates, impairs, dilutes or otherwise violates the rights of others, and there are no grounds for the same, and Target and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling,    ##### 

  

charge, settlement, or other dispute involving any third Persons
Intellectual Property Rights, and (iii) no person has infringed,

otherwise violating, any Intellectual Property Rights owned or used by Target
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with their respective businesses as

 5.21 No Additional Representations. Acquiror and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that neither Target nor any other Person advising or acting on behalf of Target or any Affiliate of Target (i) has made any representation or warranty express or implied, including any implied representation or warranty, as to the condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose of any of the assets used in the businesses of or held by Target, or (ii) has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Target or the business conducted by Target, in each case except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to be set forth in the Target Disclosure Schedule.

such information to any such third party, Target shall give written notice to
Acquiror.

Target shall be required to comply with its obligations under _Section 6.4(a)_ whether or not its Board of Directors withdraws, modifies, withholds, or changes its    ##### 

  

recommendation or declaration regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or recommends or declares the advisability of any other
offer or proposal.

 (c) Neither the supplementation of the disclosure schedules pursuant to the obligation in _Section 6.11(b)_ nor any disclosure after the date hereof of the untruth of any representation and warranty made in this Agreement shall operate as a cure of any breach of (i) the failure to disclose the information, nor (ii) any untrue representation or warranty made herein.
