Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Accountant that the
determinations of such firm with respect to any Disagreement shall be rendered
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the referral of the Disagreement or as
soon thereafter as reasonably possible. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accountant shall be limited to whether the unresolved items in
dispute that were included in the Notice of Dispute were prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Accounting Principles, and the
engagement agreement with the Accountant shall instruct the Accountant to
determine, on such basis, whether and to what extent the Closing Statement
requires adjustment. The engagement agreement with the Accountant shall
provide that the Accountant's decision shall be based solely on written
submissions and presentations by Seller and Buyer and their respective
representatives and not by independent review. The engagement agreement with
the Accountant shall provide that the Accountant shall address only those
items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item by either Party or smaller than the smallest value for
such item claimed by either Party. The determination of the Accountant
pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) shall be final and binding on the Parties. The
fees, costs, and expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated between Seller,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the Accountant that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the
Accountant) bears to the total amount of disputed items so submitted;
provided, that such fees, costs, and expenses shall not include, so long as a
Party complies with the procedures of this Section 2.5, the other Party's
outside counsel or accounting fees. The Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Cash Balance, and Closing Indebtedness Amount, each
as set forth on the Closing Statement as finally determined in accordance with
the terms of this Section 2.5(d), shall be referred to as the "Final Closing
Balance Sheet," "Final Net Working Capital," the "Final Cash Balance", the
"Final Indebtedness Amount" and the "Final Seller Transaction Expense Amount",
respectively.



(e) Adjustment Amount



(i) The "Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount" means (A) if the Final Net
Working Capital less the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is equal to a
negative number, an amount equal to the sum of such difference (expressed as a
negative number)) plus Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($850,000) (up to
a maximum of zero (0)); or (B) if the Final Net Working Capital less the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is equal to a positive number or zero
(0), an amount equal to zero (0).



(ii) The "Indebtedness Adjustment Amount", which may be positive or negative,
means the Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount less the Final Indebtedness
Amount.

(iii) The "Cash Adjustment Amount" means (A) if the Final Cash Balance less
the Estimated Closing Cash Balance is equal to a negative number, an amount
equal to such difference (expressed as a negative number) or (B) if the Final
Cash Balance less the Estimated Closing Cash Balance is equal to a positive
number or zero (0), an amount equal to zero (0).



(iv) The "Seller Transaction Expense Adjustment Amount", which may be positive
or negative, means the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses less the Final
Seller Transaction Expense Amount.



(v) The "Final Adjustment Amount", which may be positive or negative, means
the sum of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount plus the Indebtedness
Adjustment Amount plus the Cash Adjustment Amount plus the Seller Transaction
Expense Adjustment Amount.



(f) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Seller shall be
entitled to receive from Buyer an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment
Amount. If the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Buyer shall be
entitled to receive from Seller an amount in cash equal to the absolute value
of the Final Adjustment Amount.



(g) If no payment is to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5(f) or if Seller is
entitled to receive payment pursuant to Section 2.5(f), (i) Buyer shall, not
more than five (5) Business Days after determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount, make payment of the absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to, or as directed by, Seller and
(ii) Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds not more than five (5) Business Days after determination of
the Final Adjustment Amount, the entire amount of the Adjustment Escrow Funds
to, or as directed by, Seller.



(h) If Buyer is entitled to receive payment pursuant to Section 2.5(f), Buyer
and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to pay, not more than five (5) Business Days after
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, to Buyer, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, the Final Adjustment Amount from the Adjustment
Escrow Funds. In the event that such Final Adjustment Amount is less than the 

Adjustment Escrow Funds (such remaining amount of the Adjustment Escrow Funds
after payment of the Final Adjustment Amount, the "Remaining Adjustment Escrow
Funds"), Buyer and Seller shall simultaneously with delivery of the
instructions in the immediately foregoing sentence, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay, by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds
from the Adjustment Escrow Account to, or as directed by, Seller. In the event
that such Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Funds,
Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to cause the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Indemnity Escrow Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to Buyer the amount by which such
Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Funds (up to the amount
in the Indemnity Escrow Funds).



2.6 Escrow



(a) At the Closing, as provided in Section 2.3(c) hereof, Buyer shall deliver,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (i) an aggregate amount equal
to the Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit into a
separate escrow account (the "Adjustment Escrow Account") and (ii) an
aggregate amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Deposit Amount to the Escrow
Agent for deposit into a separate escrow account (the "Indemnity Escrow
Account"), in each case, established pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Adjustment Escrow Funds shall be maintained separately in the
Adjustment Escrow Account. The Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be maintained
separately in the Indemnity Escrow Account. Buyer and the Seller shall each be
responsible for one half (1/2) of the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Section 2.6 shall be construed as limiting claims by a Buyer Indemnified
Person for satisfaction of any indemnification or other claims pursuant to
Section 8.2 or otherwise, to the amount then held in escrow.



(b) Seller, the Company, and Buyer agree for all Tax purposes that: (i) the
right of Seller to the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow
Amount shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for
installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding
provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate; (ii) interest may
be imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code;
(iii) Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and
the Indemnity Escrow Amount and all interest and earnings earned from the
investment and reinvestment of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, or portion thereof, shall be allocable to Buyer pursuant to
Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation 1.468B-8; and
(iv) in no event shall the total amount of the Adjustment Escrow Amount or the
Indemnity Escrow Amount paid to Seller under this Agreement exceed an amount
designated by the Parties prior to Closing.



(c) On the third (3rd) Business Day after the twelve (12)-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent (in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) to such account(s) designated by Seller, the
amount of any remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds that are not claimed by Buyer,
on or prior to the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, to be 

owed to a Buyer Indemnified Person, together with any interest earned on any
such amount, for distribution to Seller, all as may be provided in and
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

or other similar power, authority and capacity to execute and deliver this
Agreement and any Related Agreement to which Seller or the Company is a party,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate the

and the Company.



3.2. Valid and Enforceable Agreement; Non-contravention.



(a) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Seller and
the Company and, assuming the due execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Seller and the Company,
enforceable against each of Seller and the Company in accordance with its
terms, except that such enforcement may be subject to (i) bankruptcy,

with the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreement by Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary or the consummation
by Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. The execution of this Agreement and the Related Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will
not result in the creation of any Lien against the Shares, or against Seller,
the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets.

which only the Shares are issued and outstanding. Seller is the sole owner,
whether of record or beneficially, of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens,
and the Shares constitute the only issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company. There are no shareholder agreements, buy-sell agreements, voting
trusts, or other agreements or understandings to which Seller or the Company
is a party or to which it is bound relating to any Shares, all such agreements
previously in effect having been terminated on or prior to the date hereof.
All of the Shares were duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid

beneficially by one or more of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, free
and clear of all Liens, in the respective amounts and percentages set forth on

Subsidiary is a party or by which such Subsidiary is bound with respect to the
voting, registration under any securities Law, transfer or other disposition
of Equity Interests of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary. No holder of
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary has any right (x) to convert or
exchange such Indebtedness for any Equity Interests of the Company or any
Subsidiary or (y) to vote for the election of directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary or to vote on any other matter. Except for the Subsidiaries listed

3.24 Employee Benefit Matters.



(a) Plans. Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 3.24(a), (i) neither the

party to or otherwise have any Liability or obligation with respect to any
material Plan and (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to or

deferred compensation plan.

Section 4980B, HIPAA policies and procedures and HIPAA notice of privacy
practices.



(c) Valid Obligations; Amendment and Termination.



(i) None of the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary under any Plan will be
impaired by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all of the rights of the Company and the Subsidiaries thereunder

and there are no defaults thereunder.



(d) Compliance with Applicable Law. With respect to each Plan, no prohibited
transactions (as defined in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975) and no
violations of ERISA Section 407 have occurred. Each Plan (and its related
trust) that is intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) and to be tax-
exempt under Code Section 501(a), if any, is so qualified under and has been
determined by the IRS to qualify thereunder for all applicable requirements
and nothing has since occurred to cause the loss of the Plan's qualification
and each other Plan that is intended to qualify for Tax-preferential treatment
under applicable Law so qualifies and has received, where required, approval
from the applicable Government authority that it is so qualified and no event
has occurred or circumstance exists that may give rise to disqualification or
loss of Tax-preferential treatment. Each Plan that is intended to meet the
requirements of Code Section 408(p) as a simple retirement account has at all
times met such requirements, including, without limitation, all contribution,
documentation, notice, eligibility, and non-discrimination requirements, and
nothing has occurred that would cause such Plan to fail to meet such 

requirements or otherwise to lose its tax-favored status as such a plan. Any
employee training and participant or other notices required by ERISA, HIPAA,
COBRA, the Code, or any other state or federal Law or any ruling or regulation
of any state or federal administrative agency with respect to each Plan have
been appropriately and timely given.



(e) Claims/Liability. Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 3.24(e),
there is no pending or threatened legal action, proceeding, investigation,
suit, grievance, arbitration or other manner of litigation, claim, or Action
involving any Plan and no facts exist that would give rise thereto, other than
routine claims for benefits. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any of
their directors, officers, employees or any Plan fiduciary has any Liability
for failure to comply with ERISA, HIPAA, COBRA, the Code or other applicable
Laws. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liability by virtue of
its being a member of a controlled group with a Person who has Liability under
the Code or ERISA. Each Plan and any related trust agreement or funding
instrument complies with and is, and has been, administered, operated and
maintained in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has any direct or indirect liability under the
requirements provided by any and all applicable Laws.



(f) Financial Statements. All expenses and liabilities relating to all of the
Plans have been, and will on the Closing Date be, fully and properly accrued
on the Company's (or to the extent applicable, the Subsidiary's) books and
records and the Financial Statements reflect all of such liabilities in a
manner satisfying the requirements of all applicable Financial Accounting
Standards pronounced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The
statements of assets and liabilities of the Plans as of the end of the most
recent three fiscal years for which information is available, and the
statements of changes in fund balances, financial position and net assets
available for benefits under such Plan(s) for such fiscal years, copies of
which have been certified by the Company and furnished to Buyer, fairly
represent the financial condition of such Plan(s) as of such date and the
results of operations thereof for the year ended on such date, all in
accordance with GAAP.



(g) Contributions/Premiums. Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule
3.24(e), all contributions with respect to the Plans for all periods ending
prior to the Closing Date will be made prior to the Closing Date by the
Company or any Subsidiary. All contributions to the Plans have been made on a
timely basis in accordance with all applicable Laws, and all insurance

is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on such
review and based upon and in reliance on the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and, except for the representations and warranties made by Seller
in Article 3, in any Side Agreement or in any certificate delivered in
accordance with this Agreement, it is not relying upon any representation or
warranty of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof or
any officer, director, employee, agent or advisor thereof, or any of them, nor

after giving effect to the consummation of the Closing, (i) the sum of the

binding and enforceable obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer,
each of the other respective parties thereto (as the case may be) with respect
to the RandW Insurance Policy, provided that the coverage under the RandW
Insurance Policy shall be subject to the conditions to the insurer's

ARTICLE 6

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



6.1. Restrictive Covenant.



(a) Seller covenants and agrees that during period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending three (3) years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and
shall cause Seller's Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) induce or
attempt to induce any employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to
leave the employ of the Business, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or
in any way intentionally interfere with the relationship between the Business,
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and any of their respective employees,
(ii) intentionally interfere with the relationship between Buyer, the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries and any of the Persons that employ the individual
consultants used by Buyer, the Company of any of the Subsidiaries with the
purpose of causing such Persons employing the individual consultants to 

cease or materially decrease doing business with the Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary (it being understood that nothing restricts Seller from hiring any
of the individual consultants employed by such Persons) or (iii) hire or
engage any Person who was an employee or officer of the Business, the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries within twelve (12) months after such Person ceased
to be an employee or officer of the Business, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries; provided that nothing herein shall be construed as restricting
Seller or its Affiliates from engaging in a general solicitation of employment
not specifically directed at employees of the Business, the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries (it being agreed, however, that the provisions of clause
(iii) above shall in any event continue to apply, including with respect to
any Person that responds to any such solicitation described in this proviso).



(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause Seller's Affiliates not to, use or
disclose to anyone except authorized personnel of the Company, the
Subsidiaries, Buyer, or Buyer's Affiliates, any trade secrets or confidential
matters concerning the Business, the Company or any Subsidiary, including,
without limitation, secrets, customer lists, and credit records, employee
data, sales representatives and their territories, mailing lists, consultant
arrangements, pricing policies, operational methods, marketing plans or
strategies, product development and techniques or plans, research and
development programs and plans, business acquisition plans, new personnel
acquisition plans, designs and design projects, any Intellectual Property
(unless previously publicly disclosed in a manner which would not and does not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other relevant agreement) and any
other research or business information concerning the Company or any
Subsidiary, which Seller, the Company, or any Subsidiary currently treats as
confidential (whether or not a trade secret under applicable law); provided
that the foregoing shall not prohibit any employee, director or officer of
Seller or any of its Affiliates who is not also an employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary from using information of the Business that exists in the
memory of such Person (unaided by reference to records relating to the
Business) and consists of general business information and strategies common
to participants in the industry in which the Business operates (including
pricing policies, marketing plans or strategies common to participants in the
industry in which the Business operates and not specific to the Company or any
Subsidiary), provided that such information is not, and/or to the knowledge of
such person, considered by the Company or its Subsidiary to be a trade secret
under applicable law and/or such use does not infringe upon any Intellectual
Property of the Company or any Subsidiary.



(c) For purposes of this Section 6.1, all references to the "Business" shall
be deemed to include, during any period or at any time following the Closing,
Buyer or such of its Affiliates as is then carrying on the Business, or the

requires.



(d) Seller acknowledges that the foregoing restrictions are reasonable and
agrees that in the event of any breach thereof the harm to Buyer, the Company,

and therefore that injunctive relief with respect thereto will be appropriate,
in each case without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual
damages. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
any of the foregoing provisions are unenforceable as stated, the Parties
intend that such 

restrictions be modified to permit the maximum enforceable restriction on
Seller's and its Affiliates' competition with the Business, the Company and
the Subsidiaries.



6.2. Taxes.



(a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and
charges, whether imposed on Buyer, Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary,
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall be paid one half by Seller on one hand and one half by
Buyer on the other hand when due, and Seller will, at its own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes, fees and charges and, if required by applicable Law, Buyer will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation. Except as otherwise provided herein, Seller shall
remain liable for any Taxes imposed on it as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate, including a resale certificate,
or other document from any Government authority as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).



(b) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary for any taxable year
or period ending on or before the Closing Date in a manner consistent with
prior practice, except for changes required by Law or fact ("Pre-Closing
Periods") and, to the extent not set forth in the calculation of Net Working
Capital and taken into account in the calculation of Purchase Price, pay or
remit any Tax due with respect to such Tax Returns. Seller shall permit Buyer
to review any such Tax Returns and shall incorporate any reasonable comments
to such Tax Returns prior to filing. For all purposes of this Agreement, the
Parties agree that, to the extent allowed by applicable Law, each of Buyer,
the Company and each Subsidiary shall report any deductions, expenses, losses
or similar items resulting from any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as being deductible for Income Tax purposes for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Any amounts payable
by Seller pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) shall be treated as an amount
payable under Section 8.2(a)(iv) for all purposes of this Agreement.



(c) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary for any Tax year or
period commencing on or prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
Date ("Straddle Period"). To the extent not set forth in the calculation of
Net Working Capital and taken into account in the calculation of Purchase
Price, Seller shall pay to the Company within seven (7) Business Days after
the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such Straddle Periods an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit Seller to review, comment, and
grant or reasonably withhold consent to any such Tax Returns prior to filing.
For purposes of Section 6.2(b) and this Section 6.2(c), the portion of such
Taxes that relate to the portion of such Tax period ending as of the Closing
Date shall (x) in the case of property, ad valorem and other Taxes imposed on
a periodic basis, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Tax period ending as of the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in 

the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income, gains, receipts, gross margins, employment, sales, use, or other Taxes
imposed on a non-periodic basis reasonably allocable using a closing-of-the-
books approach, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended as of the Closing Date pursuant to an interim
closing-of-the-books. Any credits relating to a Tax period that begins on or
before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though
the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the allocations described in this Section 6.2(c)
shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice, except for changes
required by Law or fact. Any amounts payable by Seller pursuant to this
Section 6.2(c) shall be treated as an amount payable under Section 8.2(a)(iv)
for all purposes of this Agreement.



(d) Buyer and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and Tax filings) and
assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, the
conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter relating to the Company or any
Subsidiary. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any such Tax audit or other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver
such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section 6.2. Any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding that relates
to a taxable period of the Company or any Subsidiary ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be a Third Person Claim subject to the
procedures set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement.



(e) [Reserved.]



(f) None of Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit the Subsidiaries to) (i) file,
amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part
to the Company or the Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) make any Tax
election (including, but not limited to, an election pursuant to Sections 336
or 338 of the Code) that has retroactive effect to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) file any ruling
or request with any taxing authority that relates to Taxes or Tax Returns of
any of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; or (iv) enter into any
voluntary disclosure with any taxing authority regarding any Tax or Tax
Returns of any of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including any
voluntary disclosure with a taxing authority with respect to filing Tax
Returns or paying Taxes for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on
or prior to the Closing Date in a jurisdiction that any of the Subsidiaries
did not previously file a Tax Return or pay Taxes), in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, it being understood that it would be unreasonable to withhold such
consent in any instance where such proposed action is required under
applicable Law; provided, however, that Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Affiliates may take such actions to the extent the
Buyer Indemnified Persons forego their rights to indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2 with respect to any Loss that is the result of the actions set
forth in this Section 6.2(f) and such actions would not subject Seller to
additional Tax liability.



6.3. Outstanding Class B Equity Grants. The Company and Seller hereby
acknowledge that Buyer does not and shall not assume any liability under any
outstanding award agreements granting Class B Units of Seller to any current
or former director, officer, manager, or employee of Seller, whether or not
granted under the Apollo Investors, LLC Incentive Plan.

ARTICLE 8

INDEMNIFICATION



8.1. Survival.



(a) Except as set forth below, none of the representations and warranties made
by Seller in this Agreement or any certificates or documents delivered
hereunder shall survive the Closing, and following the Closing, no Party shall
be entitled to any recovery in respect thereof or make any claim whatsoever
for any inaccuracy or breach of any such representation or warranty; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained herein:



(i) the representations and warranties contained in (i) Section 3.1 (Corporate
Existence and Power), Section 3.2(a) (Valid and Enforceable Agreement; Non-
contravention), Section 3.3 (Capitalization and Ownership), Section 3.4
(Subsidiaries), and Section 3.33 (Brokers, Finders) shall survive the Closing
Date indefinitely and not expire (collectively, together with the
representations set forth in Section 3.9 (Taxes), the "Fundamental
Representations");



(ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.9 (Taxes) shall
survive the Closing Date until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable to the underlying subject matter of such
representation or warranty (including any extensions or tolling thereof);



(iii) this Section 8.1 shall not limit any claim or recovery available to
Buyer (or any additional insured) under the RandW Insurance Policy;



(iv) the provisions of this Section 8.1 will not prevent or limit in any way a
cause of action on account of knowing and intentional actual fraud by Seller
(provided that with respect to any such fraud, only knowing and intentional
actual fraud by a Deal Team Member, and not any other individual, shall be
attributable to Seller or constitute actual fraud by Seller) with respect to
the matters relied upon by Buyer herein, in any Side Agreement or in any
certificate delivered in accordance with this Agreement (and, for
clarification and illustrative purposes, not including any constructive or
equitable fraud) (hereinafter referred to as "actual fraud"); and



(v) for the avoidance of doubt, all covenants and other agreements of Seller
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their
terms; 

except that any expiration referred to above shall have no effect on any
representations, warranties or obligations in respect of which a notice of
claim has been submitted hereunder prior to such expiration; and, in each case
described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), the applicable Party shall
be entitled to any recovery in respect thereof and to make claims with respect
to any inaccuracy or breach thereof or otherwise with respect thereto, as
provided in this Article 8.



(b) All of the representations and warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement
or any certificates or documents delivered hereunder shall survive the Closing
Date and will continue for a period of twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date, at which time they shall expire, except that such expiration
shall have no effect on any representations, warranties or obligations in
respect of which a notice of claim has been submitted hereunder prior to such
expiration and the applicable Party shall be entitled to any recovery in
respect thereof and to make claims with respect to any inaccuracy or breach
thereof or otherwise with respect thereto, as provided in this Article 8;
provided, however, that the representations and warranties contained in (i)
Section 4.1(a) (Existence and Power), Section 4.2 (Valid and Enforceable
Agreement; Authorization), Section 4.5 (Investment Intent), Section 4.6 (Due
Diligence Review), Section 4.7 (Solvency), Section 4.8 (Brokers, Finders), and
Section 4.9 (RandW Insurance Policy) shall survive the Closing Date indefinitely
and not expire. All covenants and other agreements of Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.



8.2. Indemnification for Buyer Indemnified Persons.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 8, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries), the
employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Affiliates, and the shareholders,
members, directors, managers, officers, partners, employees, successors,
assigns, representatives, and agents of each of them in their capacities as
such (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Persons"), from and against, and
Seller waives any claim for contribution or indemnity against the Company, the
Subsidiaries, and their Affiliates with respect to, any and all claims,
losses, monetary damages, obligations, liabilities, fines, fees, penalties,
expenses, or costs, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs,
and expert witness fees and expenses, incurred in connection therewith and/or
in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement (each individually a
"Loss" and collectively, "Losses") incurred or to be incurred by any of them
resulting from or arising out of or in connection with:



(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in the Fundamental Representations;



(ii) any breach of any covenant or other obligation of Seller made or incurred
under or pursuant to this Agreement, any Related Agreement, or any other
document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection with the Closing;



(iii) the Seller Transaction Expenses, to the extent not included in the Final
Seller Transaction Expense Amount;



(iv) Taxes imposed or assessed on the Company or any Subsidiary (A) for any
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, (B) for
the 

employer portion of any payroll Taxes, withholding Taxes or otherwise imposed
with respect to payments made in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 6.2(a),
or (C) resulting from a breach of any of the representations or warranties or
the covenants contained in Sections 3.9 and 6.2 hereof; provided that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall have no
obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons against, or reimburse any
Buyer Indemnified Persons for, any Losses pursuant to this Section 8.2 (or
otherwise) to the extent incurred or to be incurred resulting from or arising
out of or in connection with the Filing Issue;



(v) any Indebtedness of the Company or the Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing, to the extent not included in the Final Indebtedness Amount; and



(vi) any claim or threatened claim by any Seller Party or any actual or
purported holder of any Equity Interest in the Seller, Company or any
Subsidiary (including Seller), in their capacity as an equity or debt holder
(including with respect to any membership or ownership interest in Seller,
including any Class A Units or Class B Units of Seller, whether or not granted
under the Apollo Investors, LLC Incentive Plan or evidenced by an award
agreement granted to an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary), in each
case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding (other than
this Agreement and any of the other agreements executed and delivered by Buyer
in connection herewith) or otherwise at law or equity (other than claims for
which the facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim first occur
following Closing).



(b) From and after the Closing, without limiting the rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons hereunder or under the RandW Insurance Policy, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover any Losses which they are
entitled to recover hereunder from Seller or from the Seller Parties pursuant
to the terms of the Side Agreements, and if any Buyer Indemnified Person seeks
any such recovery from any Seller Party under the Side Agreements, such action
shall not relieve Seller or any other Seller Party from any obligations
hereunder or under a Side Agreement.



8.3. Indemnification for Seller Indemnified Persons. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article 8, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its representatives, agents, employees,
representatives, officers, managers, directors, successors, and assigns (the
"Seller Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Losses incurred or
to be incurred by any of them, resulting from or arising out of or in
connection with:



(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations or warranties of Buyer
contained in this Agreement; and



(b) any breach of any covenant or other obligation of Buyer made or incurred
under or pursuant to this Agreement, any Related Agreement, or any other
document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection with the Closing.



8.4. Notice of Claim; Order of Recoupment.



(a) In the event that Buyer seeks indemnification on behalf of a Buyer
Indemnified Person, or Seller seeks indemnification on behalf of a Seller
Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give reasonably prompt written notice to the indemnifying Party
(the "Indemnifying Party") specifying the facts constituting the basis for
such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted;
provided, that the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder shall not be
adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to
the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby.



(b) Payment of any indemnification obligations of the Seller pursuant to this
Article 8, subject in each case to the limitations in this Article 8, shall
first be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account, then from the RandW Insurance
Policy (if and to the extent covered thereby), and then to the extent such
indemnifiable Losses exceed the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Account and are
not covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, such excess shall be paid by the
Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, including the foregoing sentence, the
RandW Insurance Policy shall be deemed to not cover Losses for indemnification
obligations of Seller (i) that arise solely under Section 8.2(a)(ii), (ii)
until the Buyer has determined, in good faith, that the Retention (as defined
in the RandW Insurance Policy) has been fully eroded, (iii) for which a claim
has been made by Buyer under the RandW Insurance Policy and coverage has been
denied by the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy or (iv) once the RandW
Policy Amount is $0 or less. For the sake of clarity, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing sentence (A) has been provided for the
convenience of the Parties hereto in connection with identifying the order of
payment for certain types of indemnification claims by Buyer hereunder, and
that it is not intended, and shall not in any way be considered to be, a
complete list of the circumstances in which the RandW Insurance Policy may be
determined to not cover Losses for which the Buyer is entitled to
indemnification for hereunder or under the Side Agreements and (B) does not,
and shall not, affect, modify or change any obligations of the insurer under
and pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy. If any indemnification payment is to
be made from the Indemnity Escrow Account, Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent
to pay such amount not more than thirty (30) days after any Buyer Indemnified
Party provides notice to Seller of such amount. If any indemnification payment
is to be made by Seller directly, Seller shall pay such amount not more than
thirty (30) days after any Buyer Indemnified Party provides notice to the
Seller of such amount.



8.5. Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons.



(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Party hereunder
(a "Third Person"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be
adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to
the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.5, the Indemnifying
Party shall then have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party
(a "Defense Notice") within fifteen (15) days after receipt from the
Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, 

to investigate, contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a
"Third Person Claim"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has
unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect
to such Third Person Claim and to discharge any cost or expense arising out of
such investigation, contest, or settlement (subject to the limitation set
forth in this Article 8). The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in
(but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own
counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to
avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party
so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to
look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of
defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the
Defense Notice within said fifteen (15)-day period, (i) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to have the control over said defense and settlement of the
subject claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make
available to the Indemnified Party such assistance and materials as it may
reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at
its expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing, and the Indemnifying Party, if it is required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, will be liable for all costs and
settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection therewith. If the
Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the
Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of
any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by
clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the
defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each
other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such Third
Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof, including cooperation
with any insurer to the extent applicable.



(b) Subject to the other terms of this Section 8.5, in the event that the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with respect to such Third Person
Claim within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof and thereby elects to
conduct the defense of the subject claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to have control over said defense and, subject to the provisions set
forth below, settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance
and materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnified Party
shall have the rights at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing. In such an event, the Indemnifying Party will not
settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law
or any violation of the rights of any Person; (ii) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii)
the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such Third Person Claims effected without its consent, in
which cases the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.5,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may participate
in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control,
including the right to select defense counsel, over the 

defense or settlement of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining
order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against
the Indemnified Party, (ii) that involves criminal allegations against the
Indemnified Party, (iii) that, if successful, would set a precedent that would
materially interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on, the business
or financial condition of the Indemnified Party, or (iv) that imposes
liability on the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In such event, the Indemnifying
Party will still be subject to its obligations hereunder, and the Indemnified
Party will not settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
required by the carrier of the RandW Insurance Policy in connection with any
claim made by a Buyer Indemnified Person thereunder, the conduct of the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim will be assigned to counsel
selected or approved by the carrier of the RandW Insurance Policy, or otherwise
conducted in coordination with the carrier of the RandW Insurance Policy, in
each case without prejudice to the rights of the parties hereunder, and Seller
and the Buyer Indemnified Persons will reasonably cooperate at Buyer's expense
with the carrier of the RandW Insurance Policy and such counsel in the defense
of the Third Party Claim and otherwise comply with the requirements of the RandW
Insurance Policy applicable to such party in connection therewith.



8.6. Calculation of Losses.



(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article 8 by the Indemnifying
Party shall be (i) reduced by any Tax Benefits actually realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses
and (ii) increased by any Tax Detriment actually realized by the Indemnified
Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses. For purposes
hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean the actual amount of any reduction in Taxes
which are otherwise due, when and as actually realized (whether paid,
received, credited or otherwise realized). For purposes hereof, "Tax
Detriment" shall mean the actual amount of any increase in Taxes which are
otherwise due, when and as actually incurred (whether paid, reduction in
refund or credit or otherwise incurred). To the extent the Indemnified Party
realizes a greater Tax Benefit with respect to a particular Loss subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss
than was taken into account at the time of such indemnification payment, then
such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
such payment up to the amount of such greater incremental Tax Benefit.



(b) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Buyer has obtained the RandW Insurance
Policy for purposes of coverage of losses related to breaches by the Seller of
representations and warranties (including, without limitation, the Fundamental
Representations) and the indemnification obligations of Seller contained in
Section 8.2(a)(iv) of this Agreement. If any Losses sustained by a Buyer
Indemnified Person are covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, the Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under the
RandW Insurance Policy to the same extent Buyer would if such Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, (i) that the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall have no obligation to first submit a claim for, seek
to collect or to actually collect upon any coverage 

under the RandW Insurance Policy as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder or under any Side Agreement, being indemnified
therefor or obtaining indemnification payments from Seller, any Seller Party
or from the Indemnity Escrow Account for Losses therefor (except that, the
right of any Buyer Indemnified Person to actually receive indemnification
payments hereunder directly from Seller or any Seller Party under any Side
Agreement (i.e., not from the Indemnity Escrow Account) with respect to any
such matter shall be subject to satisfaction of the terms of Section 8.4(b))
and (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no obligation to litigate or
arbitrate with the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy or otherwise. If a
Buyer Indemnified Person receives any amounts under the RandW Insurance Policy
prior to receipt of an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder in respect of the same Loss, then the payment by an Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement with respect to such Loss shall be reduced by the
amount received by the Buyer Indemnified Person under the RandW Insurance
Policy, net of any direct, out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such
Buyer Indemnified Person in collecting such amount (to the extent such
expenses are not reimbursed by the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy). If
a Buyer Indemnified Person receives any amounts under the RandW Insurance Policy
subsequent to receipt of an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party
in respect of the same Loss, then such Buyer Indemnified Person shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any such indemnity payment made up to the
amount received by the Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy, net of any direct, out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such
Buyer Indemnified Person in collecting such amount (to the extent such
expenses are not reimbursed by the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy).
Seller shall assist and cooperate with Buyer (at Buyer's sole expense with
respect to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in connection
therewith) in a commercially reasonable manner in connection with any claim by
Buyer under, or recovery by Buyer with respect to, the RandW Insurance Policy.



(c) If any Losses sustained by a Buyer Indemnified Person are covered under
applicable insurance policies other than the RandW Insurance Policy, the Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available
under such other applicable policies to the same extent Buyer would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, (i)
that the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no obligation to first submit,
seek to collect or to actually collect upon any coverage under any such other
applicable insurance policies as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder, being indemnified therefor or obtaining
indemnification payments from Seller or from the Indemnity Escrow Account for
Losses therefor and (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no
obligation to litigate or arbitrate with the insurer under any such other
insurance policy or otherwise. If a Buyer Indemnified Person receives any
amounts under any such other applicable insurance policy prior to receipt of
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party hereunder in respect of
the same Loss, then the payment by an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement
with respect to such Loss shall be reduced by the amount received by the Buyer
Indemnified Person under such other applicable insurance policy, net of any
direct, out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Buyer Indemnified
Person in collecting such amount. If a Buyer Indemnified Person receives any
amounts under any such other applicable insurance policy subsequent to receipt
of an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party in respect of the same
Loss, then such Buyer Indemnified Person shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any such indemnity payment made up to the amount
received by the Buyer Indemnified 

Person pursuant to such other applicable insurance policy, net of any direct,
out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Person in
collecting such amount.



(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article 8 for any (i) Losses
relating to any matter to the extent that (A) the Indemnified Party shall have
otherwise been actually compensated for such matter pursuant to the Purchase
Price adjustment under Section 2.5 hereof in the form of an increase or
decrease thereof, as applicable (as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.5, and in any such case, as evidenced by any written statements
delivered hereunder or by written communications exchanged between Seller and
Buyer or their respective accountants, or the Accountant); or (B) following
the Closing, the Indemnified Party shall have otherwise actually recovered for
such matter pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, so as to avoid
duplication or "double counting" of the same Loss (provided that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to multiple
provisions of this Article 8); or (ii) Losses that are for remote,
speculative, exemplary or punitive damages (other than remote, speculative,
exemplary or punitive damages that are paid to a third party). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing contained in
this Section 8.6(d) shall limit, alter or waive in any manner or respect any
defenses available to any Person or any burdens of proof or legal standards
required to be met by any Person under applicable Law.



(e) To the extent required under applicable Law and subject to the other terms
of this Article 8, the Indemnified Parties shall use, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and
otherwise minimize their Losses to the extent reasonably possible promptly
after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any Losses.



8.7. Limitations on Indemnity.



(a) Except in the case of actual fraud, Seller shall have no obligation to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons against, or reimburse any Buyer
Indemnified Persons for, any Losses pursuant to Section 8.2 after the
aggregate amount of all payments made by Seller hereunder in respect of such
Losses equals the Purchase Price.



(b) No Seller Indemnified Person shall have any claim for contribution from or
against the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of any indemnification or
other payments made by Seller to any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Agreement.



(c) Except (i) pursuant to a Side Agreement, (ii) in the case of actual fraud
or (iii) for any claim against Seller or any equityholder of Seller or any
equityholder of a party to a Side Agreement in the event of a distribution or
transfer of assets to any such equityholder or a declaration or payment of
dividends or distribution, that in each case, violated (A) in the case of
Seller or a Seller Party that is a Delaware limited liability company, the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (assuming, for this purpose, that
Seller or such Seller Party remains a Delaware limited liability company
subject to the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act notwithstanding any
change in the organizational form of Seller after the Closing) or (B) in the
case of any other such Person, any applicable Law, no claim shall be brought
or maintained 

pursuant to this Article 8 by Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
successors or permitted assigns or any other Buyer Indemnified Person against
any officer, director, manager, equityholder or employee (present or former)
of Seller or any officer, director, manager or employee (present or former) of
the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding Seller itself), and, except
as set forth above, no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of
them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy
in or breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company or Seller set forth or contained in this Agreement or any Exhibit or
Schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder.



(d) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Buyer or its representatives of the Company, the Subsidiaries, any of their
respective businesses, assets, liabilities, or otherwise, shall in any way
limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification or other claim by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Person under
this Agreement.



(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
all "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality type
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.7(a)(ii)) shall be ignored and not given any effect for the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
for purposes of (i) determining the amount of any Losses incurred with respect
to the indemnification provisions hereof, (ii) determining whether or not a
breach of a representation or warranty has occurred and (iii) determining
whether any the limitations on indemnification hereunder have been surpassed.



(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Buyer Indemnified
Person to make claims against the RandW Insurance Policy. For purposes of
clarity, as between Buyer, on the one hand, and the insurer under the RandW
Insurance Policy, on the other hand, none of the terms, limitations,
conditions and restrictions (including time for asserting claims) on
indemnification set forth in this Article 8 shall affect the rights of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons under the RandW Insurance Policy, which rights shall
be governed solely thereby



(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
Taxes: (i) resulting from transactions or actions taken by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons on the Closing Date after the Closing outside of the
Ordinary Course except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
imposed for or with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, except to the extent attributable to a
breach of Section 3.9(t), or (iii) to the extent attributable to any breach of
the covenants contained in Section 6.2 by any of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons.



8.8. Characterization of Indemnity Payments. Any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered, to the extent permissible
under Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all purposes.



8.9. Exclusion of Other Remedies. From and after the Closing, except in the
event of actual fraud and except to the extent provided in the Side Agreements
or in Section 8.7(c) above, 

and without limiting any rights of the Buyer Indemnified Persons under the RandW
Insurance Policy, the Buyer Indemnified Persons' sole and exclusive remedy
against the Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
representatives, employees, directors, managers or officers, whether in any
individual, corporate or any other capacity, with respect to any and all
claims relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise, shall be solely pursuant to the provisions of this Article 8 and
the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The provisions in this Agreement
relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on the Buyer Indemnified
Persons' remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby were specifically bargained for between sophisticated
parties and were specifically taken into account in the determination of the
amounts to be paid to Seller hereunder. Nothing in this Article 8 shall limit
the rights of Seller or Buyer to seek specific performance of the other
Parties' obligations hereunder in accordance with Section 9.10. Nothing in
this Article 8 shall limit a Party's right to bring a claim for actual fraud.
For purposes of clarity, as between Buyer, on the one hand, and the insurer
under the RandW Insurance Policy, on the other hand, none of the terms,
limitations, conditions and restrictions (including time for asserting claims)
on indemnification set forth in this Article 8 shall affect the rights of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons under the RandW Insurance Policy, which rights shall
be governed solely thereby.

9.2. [Reserved.]



9.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (which includes the Schedules,
Disclosure Schedules, and Exhibits hereto) and the Related Agreement embody
the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior discussions, representations,
agreements, and understandings relative to such subject matter and shall not
be modified or affected by any offer, proposal, statement or representation,
oral or written, made by or for any Party in connection with the negotiation
of the terms hereof and thereof. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the
Closing.



9.4. Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may not be amended, altered or
modified except by a written instrument executed by Buyer and Seller (on
behalf of itself and the Company). No course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.



9.5. Assignment; Binding Agreement. This Agreement and various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors, and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be transferred, delegated, or
assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise) by a Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, except that Buyer shall have the right
to transfer and assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to
any entity which at the time of such transfer and assignment is controlled by
Buyer or by Affiliates of Buyer; provided, however, that Buyer shall remain
liable for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.



9.6. Waiver of Compliance. Any failure or delay of a Party to comply with any
obligation herein may be waived only by a written instrument signed by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Any such waiver or failure
to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.



9.7. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, (a) Buyer shall pay the
fees and expenses of its counsel, accountants, experts, other representative
and all other expenses incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates (as determined
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and not
including the Company or any Subsidiary) incident or relating to the
negotiation, preparation, and execution of this Agreement and the Related
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
performance by it of its obligations hereunder and thereunder (including all
expenses related to the Title Commitments or any title insurance issued in
respect thereof) and (b) all fees and expenses of Seller, the Company, and the
Subsidiaries incurred by any of them incident or relating to the negotiation,
preparation, and execution of this Agreement and the Related Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the performance by them of
their obligations hereunder (including, without limitation, their fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, experts, and other representatives) shall be
deemed to be Seller Transaction Expenses.



9.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including via fax or e-mail transmitted (including .pdf) signature pages),
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.



9.9. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance, shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.



9.10. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
Party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any Party seeking an
injunction, a decree or order of specific performance shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy
shall be in addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which
such Party is entitled at law or in equity.



9.11. Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in
accordance with and governed by the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.



9.12. No Third Party Beneficiaries or Other Rights. Except as set forth in
Article 8 with respect to the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller
Indemnified Person, and except as set forth in Section 5.3 or Section 5.6,
nothing herein shall grant to or create in any Person not a party hereto, or
any such Person's dependents, heirs, successors, or assigns, including any
employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, any right to any
benefits hereunder, and no such party shall be entitled to sue any Party to
this Agreement with respect thereto. The representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement are made for purposes of this Agreement only and
shall not be construed to confer any additional rights on the Parties under
applicable state and federal securities Laws.



9.13. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO
THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE CHANCERY COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE OR, IN THE EVENT (BUT ONLY IN THE EVENT) THAT SUCH COURT DOES NOT
HAVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION

"DELAWARE COURTS") FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY SUCH
ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING RELATING HERETO SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE DELAWARE
COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ANY PROCESS,
SUMMONS, NOTICE, OR DOCUMENT BY U.S. REGISTERED MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS
SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR
PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS TO WHICH IT HAS SUBMITTED TO
JURISDICTION IN THIS SECTION 9.13. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IN THE DELAWARE COURTS, AND
HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD
OR CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THESE COURTS HAS
BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM OR SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED, OR RAISE ANY
SIMILAR DEFENSE OR OBJECTION.



9.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR
PROCEEDING (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES CONTEMPLATED UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER
NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN LAW, CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY,

THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY
OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.



9.15. Headings; Interpretation. The article and section headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Each reference in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Disclosure Schedule, or Exhibit,
unless otherwise indicated, shall mean an Article or a Section of this
Agreement, or a Schedule, Disclosure Schedule, or Exhibit attached to this
Agreement, respectively. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise
requires, (i) words of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using
the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively; (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and derivative or
similar words refer to this entire Agreement; (iv) the terms "include,"
"includes," "including," and derivative or similar words shall be construed to
be followed by the phrase "without limitation"; (v) references herein to
"days" are to consecutive calendar days unless Business Days are specified;
and (vi) the words "made available," "delivered" or "provided" or terms of
similar import shall mean, for purposes of Article 3 of this Agreement, with

any material, that a copy of such material has been posted on or before 9:00

Delaware as required to be applied thereunder by a court sitting in the State
of Delaware. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken, the date that is the
reference date in beginning the calculation of such period shall be excluded
(for example, if an action is to be taken within two (2) days of a triggering

end of the day on Thursday) and if the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day. The sections of the Disclosure Schedules shall be arranged in separate
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections of Article 3, and
information disclosed in one section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed on another section of the Disclosure Schedules or shall

3, in each case, if the relevance of such information to such other section of
the Disclosure Schedules, is reasonably apparently on its face, without
reference to underlying documentation.
