AND REORGANIZATION   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION
(this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of March 20, 2004, by and
among: MOLECULAR DEVICES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT");
ASTROS ACQUISITION SUB I, INC., a California corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB I"); ASTROS ACQUISITION SUB II, LLC, a
California limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("MERGER SUB II," and together with Merger Sub I, "MERGER SUBS"); and AXON
INSTRUMENTS, INC., a California corporation (the "COMPANY"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.  
RECITALS   A. Parent, Merger Subs and the Company intend to effect (1) a
merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL") ("MERGER
I") and (2) immediately following the effectiveness of Merger I, a merger of
the Company with and into Merger Sub II in accordance with this Agreement and
the CGCL and the Beverly-Killea Limited Liability Company Act (the "LLC ACT")
("MERGER II," and together with Merger I, the "MERGERS"). Upon consummation
of the Mergers, the Company will cease to exist.   B. Parent, Merger Subs
and the Company intend that Merger I and Merger II shall be treated as an
integrated transaction and that the Mergers shall qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").   C. For financial accounting
purposes, it is intended that the Mergers be accounted for as a
"purchase."   D. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II have approved this Agreement and the Mergers and the board
of directors of the Company has approved this Agreement and Merger I.   E.
Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
holders of voting capital stock of the Company are executing and delivering
to Parent a voting agreement (a "VOTING AGREEMENT") of even
date herewith.   AGREEMENT   The parties to this Agreement, intending to
be legally bound, agree as follows:   SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF
TRANSACTION   1.1 MERGERS. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the CGCL, at the Effective
Time of Merger I, Merger Sub I shall be merged with and into the Company, and
the separate existence of Merger Sub I shall cease. The Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in Merger I ("SURVIVING ENTITY I").
Immediately following the Effective Time of Merger I, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the CGCL and the LLC Act, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub
II, and the separate existence of the Company shall cease. Merger Sub II
shall continue    1.  as the surviving entity in Merger II (the
"SURVIVING ENTITY") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of the Company in accordance with the CGCL and the LLC Act.  
1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGERS. The Mergers shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the CGCL and the
LLC Act.   1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIMES. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (as permitted by this Agreement and applicable Legal Requirements) of
the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than those conditions
that by their nature must be satisfied or waived at the Closing), the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward llp, located at
3175 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be
designated by Parent (the "CLOSING DATE"), which shall be no later than the
third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6 and 7, unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. Contemporaneously with or as promptly as
practicable after the Closing, the parties shall cause to be filed a properly
executed agreement of merger ("AGREEMENT OF MERGER") for Merger I conforming
to the requirements of the CGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of
California. Immediately following the Effective Time of Merger I, the parties
shall cause to be filed a properly executed Agreement of Merger for Merger II
conforming to the requirements of the CGCL and the LLC Act with the Secretary
of State of the State of California. Each Merger shall become effective at
the time such Agreement of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of California or at such other time as the parties may agree and
specify in the respective Agreement of Merger.   1.4 ARTICLES OF
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATING AGREEMENT; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.   (A) Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time of Merger I:  
(I) the Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Entity I immediately after the
Effective Time of Merger I shall be the Articles of Incorporation of Merger
Sub I immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I;   (II) the
bylaws of Surviving Entity I immediately after the Effective Time of Merger I
shall be the bylaws of Merger Sub I immediately prior to the Effective Time
of Merger I; and   (III) the directors and officers of Surviving Entity
I immediately after the Effective Time of Merger I shall be the
respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub I
immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I.   (B) Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time of Merger II:   (I) the
Articles of Organization of the Surviving Entity immediately after the
Effective Time of Merger II shall be in a form approved by Parent;   (II)
the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity immediately after the
Effective Time of Merger II shall be in a form approved by Parent; and  
(III) the directors and officers of the Surviving Entity immediately after
the Effective Time of Merger II shall be the respective individuals who are
directors and officers of Merger Sub II immediately prior to the Effective
Time of Merger II.    2.   1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES.   (A) Subject to
the other subsections of this Section 1.5 and Section 1.9, at the Effective
Time of Merger I, by virtue of Merger I and without any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company or any shareholder of the
Company:   (I) any shares of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") then held by the Company or any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries (or held in the Company\'s treasury) ("EXCLUDED
SHARES") shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist at the
Effective Time of Merger I, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;   (II) each share of Company Common Stock then held
by Parent, Merger Subs or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of Merger I, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   (III) each
share of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub I then
outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of Surviving
Entity I; and   (IV) except as provided in clauses 1.5(a)(i) and 1.5(a)(ii)
above and subject to Section 1.9, each share of Company Common Stock then
issued and outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive
(A) $0.1359 in cash (the "CASH CONVERSION RATIO") and (B) 0.007340 of a share
of Parent Common Stock (the "STOCK EXCHANGE RATIO").   (B) If, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of Merger I, the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to preserve the
economic benefits that the Company and Parent are reasonably expected on the
date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of Merger I
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (C) If any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time of Merger I are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued, and the cash paid,
in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Surviving Entity I and the
Surviving Entity shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time of Merger I, Parent is entitled to exercise
any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted
stock purchase agreement or other agreement.   (D) No fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with Merger I (including
pursuant to Section 1.6(a)), and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon
surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s) be paid in cash the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by $18.52.    3.   (E) Neither
Parent, Surviving Entity I nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock for any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any
cash amounts, required to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (F) By virtue of
Merger II and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub II
or Surviving Entity I, (i) each membership interest of Merger Sub II then
outstanding shall remain outstanding and each certificate therefor shall
continue to evidence one membership interest of the Surviving Entity and (ii)
each share of common stock of Surviving Entity I then outstanding shall
remain outstanding and each certificate therefor shall be converted into one
membership interest of the Surviving Entity.   1.6 STOCK OPTIONS.   (A) At
the Effective Time of Merger I, by virtue of Merger I and in accordance with
the prospectuses dated April 1, 2000 and January 28, 2000 lodged with ASIC by
the Company (the "PROSPECTUSES"), and without any action on the part of the
parties hereto, each stock option that is then outstanding under the
Prospectuses, whether vested or unvested (an "ENTITLEMENT OPTION"), shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares that
were issuable upon exercise of such Entitlement Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by 0.003280 and cash equal to the product of
the number of shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Entitlement
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by $0.06074.  
(B) At the Effective Time of Merger I, by virtue of Merger I and in
accordance with the Company\'s 2001 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company\'s
1993 Stock Plan, as amended (such plans collectively referred to as the
"COMPANY STOCK PLANS"), and without any action on the part of the
parties hereto, each stock option that is then outstanding under the Company
Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested (a "COMPANY OPTION"), shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement) of the Company Stock Plans, the stock option agreement by
which such Company Option is evidenced (including any amendments thereto) and
this Agreement and converted into an option to purchase Parent Common Stock
in accordance with this Section 1.6(b) (each, an "ASSUMED COMPANY OPTION").
Each Assumed Company Option so converted shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as set
forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and any agreements thereunder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective
Time, (i) each Assumed Company Option shall be exercisable (or shall become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option, whether or not excercisable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by 0.01468 (the "ASSUMED
OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO"), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Company Option so
converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Assumed Company Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Assumed Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, (iii) any reference in
the agreement evidencing the Assumed Company Option to the Company shall be
deemed a reference to Parent and (iv) any reference in the agreement
evidencing the Assumed Company Option to Company Common Stock shall be deemed
a reference to Parent Common Stock. For purposes of the foregoing, and
consistent with Section 1.5(a)(iv), the parties agree that the value of
Parent Common Stock in determining the Assumed Option Exchange Ratio shall be
the average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock as reported on
The    4.  Nasdaq Stock Market for the 10 trading days up to and
including the trading day that is two trading days prior to the execution of
this Agreement.   (C) Parent shall file with the SEC, as promptly
as practicable, and in no event later than 15 days after the date on which
Merger I becomes effective, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to
the Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Company Options. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained in such registration statement) for so long as the
Assumed Company Options remain outstanding. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time of Merger I, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an Assumed
Company Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holder\'s rights with
respect to such Assumed Company Option and indicating that such Assumed
Company Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as
were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I (subject
to the adjustments required pursuant to this Section 1.6).   (D) The
Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions that may be necessary
(under the Prospectuses, the plans pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6.
The parties intend that the assumption of Company Options provided for under
this Section 1.6 shall comply with the provisions of Section 424(a) of the
Code, and this Section 1.6 shall be interpreted consistent with such
intent.   1.7 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY\'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective
Time of Merger I: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I shall cease
to have any rights as shareholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I.
No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made
on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time of Merger I. If, after
the Effective Time of Merger I, a valid certificate previously representing
any shares of Company Common Stock (a "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATE") is
presented to Surviving Entity I, the Surviving Entity or Parent, such Company
Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in
Section 1.8.   1.8 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (A) On or prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in Merger I
(the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time of
Merger I, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates
representing the Stock Consideration up to the number of shares necessary to
satisfy the obligation to pay Stock Consideration to the holders
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Entitlement Options as of
the Effective Time, (ii) the Cash Consideration up to the amount necessary
to satisfy the obligation to pay Cash Consideration to the holders of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Entitlement Options as of the
Effective Time and (iii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d). The shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together
with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with
respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the "EXCHANGE
FUND."   (B) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
of Merger I, the Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Company
Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in    5.  customary form
and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a
provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company
Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent (1) the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock) and (B) an amount in cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 and (2) the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.8(b), each Company Stock Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time of Merger I, to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1. If any Company
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in
its discretion and as a condition to the issuance of any certificate
representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and
to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent,
Surviving Entity I or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued
to and an amount in cash may be delivered pursuant to Section 1.5 to a person
other than the person in whose name the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Company Stock Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other
than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.   (C) No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time of Merger I shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive in Merger I until such holder surrenders such
Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time
such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or
similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without
interest).   (D) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed
to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date one year after
the Effective Time of Merger I shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore
surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section
1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for
Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, their portion of the Cash Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (E) Each of the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other

fault of the employee or contractor). No current or former shareholder,
officer, director or employee of any Acquired Corporation has any
claim,    14.  right (whether or not currently exercisable) or interest

Corporation is or ever was a member or promoter of, or a contributor to, any
industry standards body or similar organization that could require or
obligate any Acquired Corporation to grant or offer to any other Person any
license or right to any Acquired Corporation IP.   (VI) The Acquired
Corporations own or otherwise have, and immediately after the Effective Time
of Merger II, the Surviving Entity will have, all Intellectual Property
Rights needed to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted

and enforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:   (I)
Each item of Registered IP is and at all times has been in compliance with
all applicable Legal Requirements and all filings, payments and other actions
required to be made or taken to maintain such item of Registered IP in full
force and effect have been made or taken by the applicable deadline.   (II)
No interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination or other Legal Proceeding
is pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened, in which the scope,
validity, or enforceability of any Registered IP is being, has been, or could
reasonably be expected to be contested or challenged. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, there is no basis for any non-frivolous claim that any Registered
IP is invalid or unenforceable.   (G) To the Company\'s Knowledge, since
January 1, 2001 no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated, and no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating, any Acquired Corporation IP. The Company has provided or

each such letter, communication or correspondence.   (H) Neither the

agreements entered into, or required to be entered into, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) nor the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, with or without

rise to any obligation on the part of any Acquired Corporation to undertake,
or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of any
nature. Except as set forth in Part 2.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter,

Corporations have all Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable each of
the Acquired Corporations to conduct its business in the manner in which its
business is currently being conducted, and all such Governmental
Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect, except where such
failure has not had, and would not, individually or in the aggregate, be

requirements of such Governmental Authorizations. Since January 1, 2002, none

no such extension or waiver has been requested from any Acquired Corporation,
other than extensions or waivers that are no longer in effect.   (D) No
claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or has been threatened against or with
respect to any Acquired Corporation with respect to any Tax. There are no
unsatisfied Liabilities    20.  for Taxes (including Liabilities for
interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with
respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by any
Acquired Corporation with respect to any Tax (other than Liabilities for
Taxes asserted under any such notice of deficiency or similar document which
are being contested in good faith by the Acquired Corporations and with
respect to which adequate reserves for payment have been established on the
Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet). There are no liens for Taxes upon any of

Section 7121 (or corresponding or similar provisions of state, local or
foreign income Tax law), or (iii) as a result of intercompany transactions or
any excess loss accounts described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502
(or corresponding or similar provisions of state, local or foreign income Tax
law).   (E) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract to
which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party covering any employee
or independent contractor or former employee or independent contractor of any
of the Acquired Corporations that, considered individually or
considered collectively with any other such Contracts, will, or could
reasonably be expected to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment by

disallowed pursuant to Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the Code (or any
comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws). The Company has not

any of its Subsidiaries been distributed, in a transaction to which Section

any obligation under any Employee Plan to provide, retiree life insurance,
retiree health benefits or other retiree employee welfare benefits to any
Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable
Legal Requirements. To the knowledge of the Company, other than obligations
made that involve no future costs to any of the Acquired Corporations, no
Acquired Corporation has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in
oral or written form) to any former or current employee, consultant or
director (either individually or as a group) or any other Person that any
such employee, consultant or director or other Person would be provided with
retiree life insurance, retiree health benefits or other retiree employee
welfare benefits, except to the extent required by COBRA or other applicable
Legal Requirements.   (G) Part 2.19(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists all "qualified beneficiaries" to whom the Acquired Corporations as of
the date of this Agreement are obligated top provide "continuation coverage"
under any of the provisions of COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements.   (H) Each of the Employee Plans has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
with applicable Legal Requirements, including, but not limited to ERISA, the
Code, applicable U.S. and non-U.S. securities laws and regulations and
applicable foreign Legal Requirements. The Acquired Corporations have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under,
are not in default or violation of, and the Company has no Knowledge of any
default or violation by any other party to, the material terms of any
Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained or may rely on a favorable determination
letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under
the Code, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no event,
condition or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to result in
disqualification of such Employee Plan under the Code (or in the case of a
Foreign Plan, the equivalent of disqualification under any applicable foreign
Legal Requirement). There are no actions, suits or claims pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than
routine claims for benefits) against any Employee Plan or against the assets
of any Employee Plan. To the Knowledge of the Company, no breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA with respect to any Employee Plan under which any of the
Acquired Corporations or one its fiduciaries could reasonably be expected to
incur a material liability has occurred. Each Employee Plan (other than any
Employee Plan to be terminated prior to the Effective Time of Merger I in
accordance with this Agreement) can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Effective Time of Merger I in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, without liability to any
of the Acquired Corporations (other than ordinary administration expenses
and liability for accrued and vested benefits). No Employee Plan is under
audit, investigation or other Legal Proceeding by the Internal Revenue
Service, Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Body, nor is any such
audit, investigation or Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened. No Acquired Corporation has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or transaction
prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA, which is not otherwise exempt under
Section 4975(c)(2) or (d) of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA. With respect
to the Employee Plans, there are no material benefit obligations for which
contributions have not been made, or which have not been properly accrued on
the appropriate Acquired Corporation\'s financial statements.   (I) None of
the Acquired Corporations has incurred or reasonably expects to incur, either
directly or indirectly (including as a result of an indemnification
obligation), any material Liability with respect to any Employee Plan under
(i) Title I or IV of ERISA (other than a routine claim for benefits), (ii)
the penalty, excise tax or joint and several liability provisions of the Code
or any foreign Legal Requirement relating to employee benefit plans
(including Section 406, 409, 502(i), 502(l), 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA, or
Section 4971, 4975 or 4976 of the Code) or (iii) any agreement, instrument
or    23.  Legal Requirement pursuant to or under which any of the
Acquired Corporations or any Employee Plan has agreed to indemnify any
Person.   (J) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement, nor the consummation of either Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with another event, whether contingent or otherwise) will (i)
result in any bonus, severance or other payment or obligation by any Acquired
Corporation to any current or former employee, consultant or director of any
of the Acquired Corporations (whether or not under any Employee Plan); (ii)
materially increase the benefits payable or provided by any Acquired
Corporation to, or result in a forgiveness of indebtedness to any Acquired
Corporation for any such employee, consultant or director of any Acquired
Corporation; (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of payment of any
compensation, equity award or other similar benefit from any Acquired
Corporation to any employee, consultant or director of any Acquired
Corporation; (iv) result in any "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the
Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be reasonable compensation
for services rendered) from any Acquired Corporation to any employee,
consultant or director of any Acquired Corporation; or (v) result in the
disallowance of the deduction of any compensation from any
Acquired Corporation to any employee, consultant or director of any Acquired
Corporation under Section 162(m) of the Code or any other provision of the
Code or any similar foreign Legal Requirement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing (and except as set forth in Part 2.19(j) of the
Company Disclosure Letter), the consummation of Merger I will not result in
the acceleration of vesting of any unvested Company Options.   (K) The fair
market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations
with respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan.
Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall cause any the assets or
insurance obligations to be less than the benefit obligations under such
Employee Plan or Foreign Plan.   (L) Except as set forth in Part 2.19(l) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Acquired Corporations maintains
any plan, agreement or arrangement, formal or informal, that provides
material benefits in the nature of severance or has outstanding any material
liabilities with respect to severance benefits.   (M) Except as set forth
in Part 2.19(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Acquired

laws of the State of Delaware, Merger Sub I is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
California and Merger Sub II is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of California. Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II has all
necessary corporate power and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the
manner in which its business is currently being conducted; (ii) to own and
use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and
used; and (iii) to perform its obligations under all Contracts by which it is

business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the laws of
all jurisdictions where the nature of its business requires such
qualification and where the failure to be so qualified would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II.   (B) Parent and
each of its officers and directors are in compliance with, and have complied,
in all material respects with (a) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated under

officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent has

such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to Parent\'s principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting Parent\'s principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to material information required to be included
in Parent\'s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Parent\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to Parent\'s auditors and
the audit committee of the board of directors of Parent (x) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and have identified for Parent\'s auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent\'s
internal controls. Parent has heretofore made available to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of all such disclosures to Parent\'s auditors and
audit committee of the board of directors of Parent. For purposes of this

consolidated financial statements (including any related notes) contained in
the Parent SEC Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii)

to such consultation; provided, however, that each of Parent and the Company
may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent or the Company and do not reveal non-public information regarding the
other party.   5.7 RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent on or
prior to the Closing the resignation of each officer and director from
positions as an officer and director of each of the Acquired Corporations
effective as of the Effective Time of Merger I.   5.8 TERMINATION OF
EMPLOYEE PLANS. To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall ensure
that its 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan shall be terminated immediately
prior to the Effective Time of Merger I.   5.9 FIRPTA MATTERS. At the
Closing, (a) the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (in such form as
may be reasonably requested by Cooley Godward llp) conforming to the
requirements of Section 1.897-2(h)(1)(i) of the United States Treasury
Regulations and (b) the Company shall deliver to Parent the notification
required to be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service under Section
1.897-2(h)(2) of the United States Treasury Regulations (collectively, such
notice and statement are referred to herein as a "FIRPTA STATEMENT").   5.10
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all provisions in Contracts
that provide any Person with rights of any nature with respect to the board
of directors of any Acquired Corporation (except as provided generally
by such Acquired Corporations\' articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) or by applicable law) are validly and
effectively terminated as of the Effective Time of Merger I.   5.11
EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.   (A) Parent agrees that all employees of the
Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Parent or the Surviving
Entity after the Effective Time of Merger I shall be eligible to continue to
participate in Parent\'s health, vacation and other employee benefit plans to
the same extent as employees of Parent in similar positions and at similar
grade levels and Parent shall credit on a year-for-year (or applicable
portion thereof) basis each such Continuing Employee\'s (as defined below)
service with the Acquired Corporations, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate in and vesting under (except for equity based
plans) such employee benefit plan of Parent; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section 5.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any such health,
vacation or other employee benefit plan at any time. For purposes of this
Section 5.11, "CONTINUING EMPLOYEES" shall mean employees of any of
the Acquired Corporations who are employed by Parent or the Surviving Entity
for any period of employment after the Effective Time of Merger I. Nothing in
this Section 5.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create
a right in any employee to employment with Parent or the Surviving Entity
and, subject to any other binding agreement between an employee and Parent or
the Surviving Entity, the employment with each Continuing Employee shall be
"at will" employment.    43.   (B) Prior to the Closing, the board of
directors of each of the Company and Parent, or an appropriate committee of
non-employee directors of each of the board of directors of the Company and
Parent, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of
the SEC so that the (i) disposition by any officer or director of the
Acquired Corporations of Company Common Stock or Company Options and (ii)
acquisition by any officer or director of the Acquired Corporations who may
become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder ("SECTION 16") of (A) the
Assumed Company Options to acquire Parent Common Stock or (B) shares of
Parent Common Stock, pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.   (C) Prior to the Closing,
the boards of directors of the Company and Parent, or appropriate committees
thereof, shall adopt resolutions confirming their interpretation of the
Company Stock Plans that no "Employee" or "Consultant" (as those terms are
defined in the Company Stock Plans) will be deemed to have terminated such
person\'s employment or consulting service within the meaning of the Company
Stock Plans solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.11(c) shall
be construed to prevent Parent from terminating an employee\'s or
consultant\'s employment or service with Parent, the Company or Sub II as of
or after the Effective Time, and with respect to any Company Options or other
stock awards under the Company Stock Plans, any such termination
of employment or service shall have the effects set forth in the Company
Stock Plans.   5.12 TAX MATTERS. If as of the Closing Date the ratio of (i)
the fair market value of the Parent Common Stock received by holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Merger I to (ii) the amount of cash and the
fair market value of any consideration other than cash received by holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Merger I is at least 0.42, then the parties
agree as follows:   (A) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall
they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be
taken any action that would disqualify the Mergers as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to take or cause to be
taken any action that would cause the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (B) Each of the Company
and Parent shall report the Mergers as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.   (C)
Nothing in this Section 5.12 shall require any change to the amount or type
of consideration that would otherwise be payable to any person pursuant to
this Agreement.   5.13 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS. During the Pre-
Closing Period, (a) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 6 to be satisfied on a timely basis
and (b) Parent and Merger Subs shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 7 to be satisfied on a timely
basis.   5.14 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.   (A) All rights
to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those Persons who are
directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this Agreement (the
"INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") for their acts and omissions as directors and officers
occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company\'s articles
of incorporation and bylaws (as in effect as of the    44.  date of this

Company and said Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) in the forms provided by the Company to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect (to the fullest extent such rights to indemnification are
available under and consistent with California law) for a period of six years
from the Effective Time of Merger I.   (B) Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Entity to, fulfill the obligations under Sections 5.14(a)
above. Parent will not, and Parent will not permit the Surviving Entity to,
merge or consolidate with any other Person unless the resulting or surviving
entity assumes (by operation of law or otherwise) the obligations imposed by
this Section 5.14.   (C) In the event Parent or the Surviving Entity
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee
of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.14.   (D) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, cause to be maintained in
effect for the benefit of the Company\'s current directors and officers an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance")
covering each such person currently covered by the officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance policies of the Company on terms with respect to coverage
and in amounts no less favorable than those of the Company\'s policies in
effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO; Insurance in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the

insurance that is available for such amount.   5.15 LETTER OF THE

letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Form S-4 Registration Statement.

prepare and cause to be lodged with ASIC the Australian Prospectus. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Australian Prospectus
to comply with the Australian Corporations Act (subject to any exemption or
modification granted by ASIC) and regulations to the extent applicable and to
respond promptly to any comments of ASIC or its staff. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to apply to ASIC for, and obtain, an
exemption from the provisions of the Australian Corporations Act to the
extent necessary or desirable to permit the issuance under Merger I of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Stock Options to persons resident in Australia by way
of a document or documents incorporating information required to be disclosed
