21

    

 business hours to review the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the working papers of Buyer, the Company, and the independent
accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and
the calculation of the Purchase Price, Preliminary Closing Cash, Preliminary
Closing Indebtedness, Preliminary Closing Net Working Capital, Preliminary

advisers of Buyer and the Company who were involved in the preparation of

Subsidiaries.

 

(b) _Closing Statement Review_. If the Sellers Representative disagrees with
Buyers calculation of any item in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, the Sellers Representative may, within forty-five
(45) days after delivery thereof, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with
such calculation and which specifies the Sellers Representatives
calculation of such amount and in reasonable detail the Sellers
Representatives grounds for such disagreement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_
"). The Notice of Disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to
which the Sellers Representative disagrees, and the Sellers Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_. If the
Notice of Disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.5(b)_, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, during the thirty (30)
days following such delivery, work in good faith to resolve any differences
that they may have with respect to the matters in the Notice of Disagreement.
If Sellers Representative does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement to Buyer
within forty-five (45) days after Buyer delivers the Closing Statement, then
the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement.

 

(c) _Closing Statement Dispute Resolution_. If Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to reach such agreement during the thirty (30) days
following the Sellers Representatives delivery of the Notice of Disagreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, then such disputes shall be referred to
PricewaterhouseCoopers or another firm of independent accountants of
internationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the
Sellers Representative (the " _Accountant_ "). The Sellers Representative
and Buyer shall each enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accountant. The Sellers Representative and Buyer shall furnish the Accountant
with a statement setting forth the items from the Notice of Disagreement which
are still in dispute (the " _Accountant Dispute Notice_ ") and the position,
including the specific amount proposed, of each of the Sellers Representative
and Buyer with respect to each such disputed item. In resolving such dispute,
the Accountant shall (i) consider only those items or amounts in the Closing
Statement as to which the Sellers Representative has disagreed in the Notice
of Disagreement, (ii) act as an arbitrator and not as an expert and (iii)
make a final determination based solely on written materials submitted by
Buyer and the Sellers Representative in accordance with this Agreement (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review). The Accountant shall be instructed
by Buyer and the Sellers Representative to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Buyer and the Sellers Representative, as promptly as
practicable, in any event no more than forty-five (45) days after referral, a
report setting forth 

 



22

    

 its determination of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in the
Closing Statement as to which there is disagreement as specified in the
Accountant Dispute Notice, including a description of the basis for such
determination. In the absence of fraud, bad faith or manifest error, such
report shall be final and binding upon the parties. With respect to each
disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either the Sellers Representative or Buyer, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the
Sellers Representative and Buyer in the Accountant Dispute Notice with
respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Accountant shall not review any line items or make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters in the Accountant Dispute
Notice that are in dispute. The Sellers Representative and Buyer shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to, cooperate and assist in such
review conducted by the Accountant, including making available books, records
and personnel. Neither Buyer, the Sellers Representative, Sellers, the
Company nor any of their respective Representatives shall engage in any ex
parte communications with the Accountant. The fees and expenses of the
Accountant shall be paid by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the
Sellers, on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded to the Sellers
or Buyer, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by
the Sellers Representative and Buyer.

(d) _Final Purchase Price_. For purposes of this Agreement, (the " _Final
Purchase Price_ " means the amount equal to (i) Base Purchase Price, _plus_
(ii) Final Closing Cash, _minus_ (iii) Final Closing Indebtedness, _plus_ (iv)
the amount, if any, by which Final Closing Net Working Capital exceeds Target
Net Working Capital, _minus_ (v) the amount, if any, by which Target Net
Working Capital exceeds Final Closing Net Working Capital, _plus_ (vi) Final
Growth Capex Expenditures, _minus_ (vii) Final Transaction Expenses;
_provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing calculations of the actual
Positive Adjustment Items, the sum of such Positive Adjustment Items for which
Buyer shall be responsible for pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall in no
event exceed the Positive Adjustment Cap.

(e) _Upward Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the Final Purchase Price is greater
than the Estimated Purchase Price (such amount, an " _Upward Adjustment
Amount_ "), Buyer shall pay each of the Sellers, in accordance with their
respective Ownership Percentage, the Upward Adjustment Amount by wire
transfer in immediately available U.S. funds. In such event, the Escrow Agent
shall pay each of the Sellers, in accordance with their respective Ownership
Percentage, all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 

(f) _Downward Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the Estimated Purchase Price is
greater than the Final Purchase Price (such amount, a " _Downward Adjustment
Amount_ "), then Buyer shall be entitled to claim solely from the Adjustment
Escrow Fund an amount of cash equal to the lesser of (i) the remaining amount
of the Adjustment Escrow Fund and (ii) the Downward Adjustment Amount, and
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall promptly deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing it to release such amount to
Buyer. In the event that the amount of funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund
exceeds the Downward Adjustment Amount, then the Escrow Agent shall, after
paying the Downward Adjustment Amount to Buyer, pay each of the Sellers, in
accordance with their respective Ownership Percentage, the remaining amount
of funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 



23

    

(g) _Designated Escrow Fund_. Upon expiration of the Designated Confirmation
Notice Deadline, the Escrow Agent shall pay each of the Sellers, in
accordance with their respective Ownership Percentage, the funds in the
Designated Escrow Fund; _provided_ , in the event that, prior to the
expiration of the Designated Confirmation Notice Deadline, (i) the
representation in clause (A) of the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.18_
with respect to the Designated Counterparty in connection with the WMA was
untrue as and when made and (ii) the Designated Counterparty terminates the
WMA pursuant to Section 1.4 thereof, then, upon either the joint written
instructions of the Parties or a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer the funds in the Designated
Escrow Fund.

(h) _Payments_. Any payment required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(e)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.5(g)_ shall be made as soon as
practicable, and in any case within five (5) Business Days after the party or
parties required to make such payment receives payment instructions from the
other party (with the Sellers Representative acting on behalf of all Sellers
to deliver and receive such instructions).

 

2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration or any payment otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Law, including United States federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law, _provided_ that if Buyer reasonably believes that any
withholding is required with respect to a payment under this Agreement, then
it shall provide written notice to the Sellers Representative at least three
(3) Business Days prior to making such payment and shall cooperate to the
extent commercially reasonable with the Sellers Representative to reduce or
eliminate any required withholding. If Buyer, the Company or the Escrow Agent
so withholds and pays such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority, any amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom Buyer, the
Company or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, made such deduction and
withholding.

other improvements included in the Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property (collectively, the " _Improvements_ ") are in material compliance

services appropriate for the operation of the Improvement located on such

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance

before the Closing. Buyer agrees to take all necessary actions to maintain
such policies in full force and effect and fulfill its obligations thereunder

the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act
would cause such breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing
is not a condition to the Closing.

(e) Buyer shall, upon the request of Sellers, keep Sellers informed on a
current basis of the status of the Financing and material developments with
respect thereto and provide Sellers promptly (and in no event later than
within one (1) Business Day) with copies of any material definitive
agreements related to the Financing.

6.7 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Debt Financing or any Substitute Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions specified in the Debt Commitment Letter (and, in any event, no
later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)(A)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and comply with all of their
respective covenants and obligations thereunder, (B) negotiate and, assuming
all conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ hereof have been
satisfied, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing reflecting the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, so that such agreements are in effect no later than the
time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3_ and (C) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions to the Debt Financing and the
definitive agreements related thereto that are in Buyers (or its
Affiliates) 

 



65

    

 control. In the event that all conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have
been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, and
the Closing should otherwise occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at Closing.

 

(b) Buyer shall promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day)
after obtaining knowledge thereof, give Sellers written notice (i) of any
breach or default by Buyer, its Affiliates, any Debt Financing Source or any
other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related
to the Debt Financing (or any event or circumstance, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would give rise to any breach or default)
that would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of any Debt Financing
Source to comply with its funding obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter
or that would prevent the Debt Financing from being consummated at Closing,
(ii) of receipt of written notice of any threatened or actual withdrawal,
repudiation, expiration, intention not to fund or termination of or relating
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or (iii) of any material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing (other than
ordinary course of business negotiations) that would be reasonably likely to
result in the failure of any Debt Financing Source to comply with its funding
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter or that would prevent the Debt
Financing from being consummated at Closing. Buyer may amend,
modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Commitment
Letter without the prior written approval of Sellers; _provided_ that Buyer
shall not, without Sellers prior written consent, permit any such amendment,
modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to
or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Debt
Commitment Letter which would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions existing on the
Effective Date)), (B) impose new or additional conditions to the Debt
Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing or (C) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision
of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing in a manner that in the
case of this clause (C) would reasonably be expected to (I) delay, prevent or
make less likely the consummation of the Transactions hereunder or the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Financing) at Closing, (II) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce
its rights against the Debt Financing Sources or any other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (III)
adversely affect the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the Transactions; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified to add additional Debt Financing Sources
who are not parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. In
the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in
accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
of the Debt Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.7(b)_, such new commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be
a part of the "Debt Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt Commitment Letter"
for all purposes of this Agreement. Buyer shall promptly (and in any event no
later than one (1) Business Day) deliver to Sellers true, correct and
complete copies of any termination, amendment, modification or replacement of
the Debt Commitment Letter. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, to (x) notify Sellers in writing thereof, (y) use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute debt financing

 



66

    

 sufficient to replace any Debt Financing that ceases to be available (the "
_Substitute Debt Financing_ ") on terms and conditions that are not less
favorable (taken as a whole) to Buyer than the terms and conditions (taken as
a whole) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (z) use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that
provides for such Substitute Debt Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof (and, in any event, no later than one (1) Business Day), deliver to
Sellers true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and the
related fee letters (redacted in a similar manner as described in _Section_
__ _ 5.9(a)_ hereof) and related definitive financing documents with respect
to such Substitute Debt Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Debt Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Debt Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Debt Financing
shall be deemed the "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(c) Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Commitment Letter.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyers obligations
hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon Buyer obtaining the Debt
Financing, any Substitute Debt Financing or any other Financing or financing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
including _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, Buyer may terminate the Debt Commitment
Letter or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to modify the size of the Facility
(as such term is defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) if Buyer (i)
determines reasonably and in good faith that Buyer otherwise has sufficient
funds to consummate the Acquisition without the use of all or part of the Debt
Financing and (ii) Buyer deposits an amount equal to the full amount necessary
to fund the payments required to be made by Buyer under  _Article_ __ _ II_
at the Closing (or an amount which, when combined with the Facility, shall
constitute the such full amount) into a restricted, secured or escrowed
account. If Buyer decides to terminate or amend the Debt Commitment Letter,
Buyer shall deliver prior written notice of such termination or amendment to
Sellers, accompanied with evidence of the funding into a restricted, secured
or escrowed account as contemplated by the foregoing sentence. Upon
the Sellers reasonable satisfaction that sufficient funds have been
deposited into such restricted, secured or escrowed account, Buyer may deliver
notice of termination or amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter to the Debt
Financing Sources.

 

6.8 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between Buyer and the Sellers for certain Tax matters:

(a) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including costs of
filing necessary Tax Returns and other documentation in connection with such
Taxes) shall be borne and paid when due fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and,
except as otherwise taken into account in the calculation of Indebtedness,
fifty percent (50%) by Sellers. The Sellers will file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation in connection with such Taxes and, if

 



67

    

 required by applicable Law, Buyer will join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation. The Sellers Representative, Buyer and the
Company shall, upon written request, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
Transactions).

(b) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Contests_.

 

(i) The Sellers Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
file, or cause to be filed, all Pass-Through Tax Returns for the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in each case, for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are filed
after the Closing Date (collectively, " _Seller-Prepared Tax Returns_ "). Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice,
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Sellers
Representative shall deliver to Buyer, for its review and comment, a draft of
each such Tax Return at least fifteen (15) days prior to the applicable
filing deadline of such Tax Return and shall consider any reasonable comments
from Buyer in good faith. If Buyer and Sellers Representative are unable to
resolve any disputes with respect to Buyers comments through negotiation in
good faith within fourteen (14) days of Sellers Representatives receipt of
Buyers comments, unless Buyer and Sellers Representative agree to continue
to attempt to resolve any such dispute in good faith, such dispute shall be
submitted to the Accountant for resolution, which resolution shall be final
and binding upon the Parties hereto.

 

(ii) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of Blocker and all
Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries which, in each case, are not
Tax Returns prepared, or caused to be prepared, by Sellers Representative
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)(i)_ (collectively, " _Buyer-Prepared Tax
Returns_ ").

(iii) Buyer will promptly notify the Sellers Representative in writing of
any proposed Tax assessment or claim or the commencement of any audit or
Proceeding involving the Company or its Subsidiaries that relates to a Seller-
Prepared Tax Return (" _Seller Tax Contest_ "). Such notice shall contain
factual information to the extent known describing the asserted Tax Liability
in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Tax Authority in respect of any such asserted
Tax Liability. The Sellers Representative shall have the sole right to
control the conduct of any Seller Tax Contest; _provided_ , that, the Sellers
Representative shall keep Buyer informed regarding the progress and
substantive aspects of each such Seller Tax Contest, and shall provide Buyer
with copies of all written correspondence with a Governmental Authority
relating to the proceedings. Buyer, at its expense, shall be entitled to
participate in any such Seller Tax Contest, and Sellers Representative shall
not compromise or settle any such Seller Tax Contest, if such compromise and
settlement would adversely affect Buyer, without obtaining Buyers prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned. If any proposed Tax assessment, claim, audit or Proceeding
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, (A) relates to a Buyer-Prepared Tax
Return, or (B) could reasonably be expected to result in Taxes being
imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing for
which the Buyer would be

 



68

    

 economically responsible (a " _Regarded Tax Contest_ "), the Buyer shall
have the sole right to control the conduct of any Regarded Tax Contest at
their sole expense, provided that if the outcome of such Regarded Tax Contest
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect any Seller, Buyer shall keep
the Sellers Representative informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Regarded Tax Contest, and shall provide the Sellers
Representative with copies of all written correspondence with a Governmental
Authority relating to the proceedings, the Sellers Representative shall, at
the expense of Sellers, be entitled to participate in any such Regarded Tax
Contest, and Buyer shall not compromise or settle any such Regarded Tax
Contest in a manner that has a disproportionate and materially adverse effect
on the Sellers without obtaining the Sellers Representatives prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

(iv) From and after the Closing, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
reasonably cooperate and provide each other with such information as either of
them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund ( _provided_ that such filing or claim is not
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement), determining a Tax Liability or a
right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Actions_. Following the Closing, except with the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to (i) amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any
Pass-Through Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make any Tax
election or change any accounting period or method with retroactive effect
with respect to any Pass-Through Tax Return for such Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(iii) take any action to extend the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any Pass-Through Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iv)
initiate any discussion or enter into any voluntary disclosure program (or
similar program or agreement) with a Governmental Authority regarding any
Pass-Through Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date will (A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related
to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B) in the
case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on
the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date will be taken into account as though the
relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

 



69

    

(e) _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) (i) Buyer, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative and the Company agree
that the sale and purchase of (A) the Blocker Shares will be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and applicable state and local income tax purposes
as a sale of Blocker Shares under Section 1001 of the Code, and (B) the
Membership Interests will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
applicable state and local income tax purposes, pursuant to Revenue Ruling
99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 1), (i) by the Holdco Sellers as a sale of
partnership interests of the Company under Section 741 of the Code and (ii) by
Blocker as a purchase of assets of the Company (the " _Transaction Tax
Treatment_ "). Buyer, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative and the
Company shall not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to) take
any position on any Tax Return or any other filings, declarations or reports
with the Internal Revenue Service and/or other taxing authorities that
is inconsistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment unless otherwise required
pursuant to a final determination (within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a))
or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

 

(ii) Buyer, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative and the Company shall act
in good faith to agree upon an allocation of the Final Purchase Price that is
allocable to the Membership Interests (and any amounts treated as purchase
price for Tax purposes) among the assets of the Company, for federal, state,
local and foreign tax purposes in accordance with Sections 751, 755 and 1060
of the Code and analogous provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws. The
Sellers Representative shall provide its proposed allocation (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ ") to Buyer not later than the date that is ninety (90)
days after the Closing Statement is finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5_. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Allocation Schedule, Buyer
shall notify the Sellers Representative in writing of any objections to the
Allocation Schedule, and shall include a summary of the calculations and
reasoning underlying such objections. Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall seek in good faith to resolve any objections to the Allocation Schedule
and to make any agreed modifications to the Allocation Schedule within thirty
(30) days of the Sellers Representatives receipt of Buyers notification of
objections. If Sellers Representative and Buyer agree on the Allocation
Schedule, then each party agrees to file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax
Returns, in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the Allocation
Schedule. If the Sellers Representative and Buyer are unable to agree on the
Allocation Schedule within such thirty (30) day period, then each party shall
file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns based on each partys own
determination of the proper allocations of the Final Purchase Price. 

(f) The parties hereto agree that in connection with the filing of any income
Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to
the extent permitted by Law, the deductions for Transaction Expenses shall be
claimed by the Sellers in a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(g) Any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar Contract or
practice with respect to Taxes (other than Contracts entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business the primary purpose of which is not Taxes) with
respect to or involving the Company or any Subsidiary will be terminated as of
the Closing Date and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether
the current year, a future year, or a past year).

 



70

    

6.9 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer, the Company and Blocker shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, retain all books and records
relating to the Company, Blocker and each of its Subsidiaries for a period of
seven (7) years after the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, from and
after the Closing, Buyer, the Company and Blocker shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, afford to the Sellers and their counsel,
accountants and other authorized agents and Representatives, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice and upon the execution and delivery of
a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement in customary form and substance
(which shall include appropriate exceptions for disclosure relating to Tax
matters), reasonable access to the personnel, books, records and other
data relating to the Company, Blocker and each of their Subsidiaries, at the
expense of Sellers, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to
the extent that such access may be reasonably required by the requesting party
(i) to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final disposition of any
claims or audits which may have been or may be made against any such party or
its Affiliates (other than in the case of any claims or disputes between the
parties), (ii) for the preparation of Tax Returns and other documents and
reports that such party or its Affiliates are required to file with
Governmental Authorities or Tax Authorities, (iii) for accounting purposes and
(iv) in connection with the such partys financial statements, reporting
obligations and compliance with applicable Laws. The foregoing shall not
require any party to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in its reasonable judgment, upon the advice of outside counsel, is
reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege.

(b) The Sellers Representative may retain (i) copies of the materials
prepared in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Transactions, together with copies of all documents referred to in such
materials, (ii) all internal correspondence and memoranda, valuations,
investment banking presentations and bids received from other Persons in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions (which,
to the extent in the possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing, shall be transferred by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Sellers Representative at the Closing or otherwise destroyed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries at the Closing and no copy thereof shall be retained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing) and (iii)
copies of all consolidated and combined financial information and all other
accounting records prepared or used in connection with the preparation of the
Financial Statements.

 

6.10 _Confidentiality_. From the date hereof until the second anniversary of
the Closing Date (or such later date to the extent required by applicable
Law), each Seller shall, and shall direct each of its respective Affiliates
to, keep confidential and not disclose for any purpose other than as permitted
by this Agreement any and all non-public information of the Company or its
Subsidiaries unless compelled to disclose such information by judicial,
regulatory or administrative process (including by interrogatories, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, formal or informal investigative demand or
similar process) or by Law; _provided_ that in the event of any disclosure
pursuant to judicial, regulatory or administrative process or Law, each such
Seller, unless legally restricted from doing so, first inform Buyer of
its intention to disclose such non-public information so that Buyer or the
Company (at its sole cost) may attempt to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded the non-public information required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this

 



71

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall not restrict the use or disclosure of
information (a) that becomes generally available to the public, other than by
reason of the breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, or is obtained from a
third party not known to the recipient to be subject to a confidentiality
obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of such information,
(b) to the extent required under Law or any financial reporting obligation
under applicable accounting standards or as otherwise permitted herein or (c)
for purposes of enforcing each Sellers and its Affiliates rights under this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with any dispute related thereto.

6.11 _Risk of Loss; Condemnation and Casualty_.

 

(a) If at any time prior to the Closing, (i) the Owned Real Property or any
portion thereof is damaged or destroyed as a result of fire or any other
casualty or (ii) any Proceeding is filed, under which the Owned Real Property,
or any portion thereof, may be taken pursuant to any Law or by condemnation or
the right of eminent domain, the Company shall promptly give Buyer
written notice thereof (which notice shall describe the casualty or the type
of action being taken against the Owned Real Property, as applicable, and
which portions of the Owned Real Property will be affected thereby). To the
extent the Company or its Subsidiaries receives insurance proceeds from any
casualty insurance policies and/or condemnation proceeds in respect of damage,
destruction or condemnation of the Owned Real Property or any portion thereof
(collectively, " _Proceeds_ "), the Company shall either: (A) use such
proceeds to repair such damage or destruction, or replace such taken property,
as applicable (" _Restoration of the Property_ ") or (B) give Buyer a
credit at the Closing against the Base Purchase Price in an amount equal to
the Proceeds, if any, received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
lender thereto as a result of such casualty or condemnation, less any
deductible under such insurance, and any amounts spent for Restoration of the
Property.

(b) Any Restoration of the Property shall be performed by the Company and
its Affiliates in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable contracts
in a good and workmanlike manner and the Company and its Affiliates shall
consult with Buyer in connection with any Restoration of the Property. To the
extent any Affiliates of the Company (other than a Subsidiary) receives
Proceeds, Sellers shall cause such Affiliate to pay such Proceeds to the
Company or the Subsidiary designated by Buyer within five (5) Business Days of
receipt thereof.

 

6.12 _Interim Financials_. As promptly as practicable following each calendar
month prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to Buyer periodic financial reports in
the form that it customarily prepares for its internal purposes concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries and, if available, unaudited statements of
the financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the last day
of each calendar month and statements of income and changes in financial
position of such entity for the period then ended. The Company covenants that
such interim statements (a) will present fairly the financial condition of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the related results of its operations for
the respective periods then ended, and (b) will be prepared on a basis
consistent with prior interim periods. 

 



72

    

6.13 _Exclusivity_.

 

(a) The Company and the Sellers shall not, (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to) nor shall any Representative of the Company or the
Sellers, directly or indirectly (i) submit, solicit, initiate, facilitate,
discuss or negotiate with any Person (whether such discussions or negotiations
are initiated by the Company, the Sellers or otherwise) or take any other
action knowingly intended or designed to facilitate any inquiry or effort of
any Person (other than Buyer) relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
provide information with respect to the Company to any Person, other than
Buyer, relating to an Acquisition Proposal by any Person (other than Buyer)
or (iii) enter into any Contract or accept any offer relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than Buyer). The Company and the Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease all
discussions and negotiations that occurred or may have occurred on or prior to
the date of this Agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than
Buyer).

 

(b) The obligations of the Company and the Sellers under this _Section_ __ _
6.13_ shall automatically terminate upon the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_.

6.14 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each party will promptly notify the other
of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions;

(c) any Proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company (i) that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.17_ or (ii) that relate to the
consummation of the Transactions;

(d) any circumstance that could reasonably be expected to cause, in the case
of the Sellers or the Company, the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VII_ not to be satisfied or, in the case of Buyer, the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ not to be satisfied; and

 

(e) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.14_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available under this Agreement to Buyer.

6.15 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Effective as of the Closing, the
Sellers and the Company will terminate and cancel, or cause to be terminated
or canceled, (a) any Contract with the holders of any equity interests in the
Company, (b) any management or similar Contract entered into with
any Affiliate of the Sellers or direct or indirect holders of any equity
interests in the Company and (c) all other Related Party Agreements set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ in each case with
no surviving Liabilities with respect to Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates following the Closing.

 



73

    

6.16 _Consents_. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain those consents from third
parties that are required in connection with the consummation of the
Transaction contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by Buyer
and as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.16 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules_; _provided_ that the Companys failure to receive the consent from
any such third parties (except for those consents listed on _Section_ __ _
7.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedules_) shall not be deemed as a failure to
fulfill any of the conditions to Buyers obligation to consummate the
Transactions.

(d) by Buyer if (i) Buyer is not in material breach of any of its respective

ARTICLE X

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

10.1 _No Reliance_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
(as modified by the Sellers Disclosure Schedules and the Company Disclosure
Schedules), Buyer is acquiring the business of Blocker and its Subsidiaries
and the Company and its Subsidiaries "As Is, Where Is," and none of Blocker,
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or other Representatives or any other Person or Non-Recourse Party
has made or makes or is authorized to make, and Buyer hereby waives, any other
express or implied representation or warranty, express or implied, whether
written or oral, on behalf of Blocker, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries
or their respective Affiliates or other Representatives or any other Person
or Non-Recourse Party.

 



77

    

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (as
modified by the Sellers Disclosure Schedules and Company Disclosure
Schedules), none of the Sellers, Blocker, the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries or any other Person will have or be subject to any Liability or
indemnification obligation on any basis (including in contract or tort, under
applicable federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) to Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the sharing with Buyer or its Representatives, or
Buyers use of any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
materials made available to Buyer in the Data Room or management presentations
(or omissions therefrom) in expectation of the Closing or otherwise. Except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement
(as modified by the Sellers Disclosure Schedules and Company Disclosure
Schedules), it is understood and Buyer acknowledges that any cost estimates,
projections or other predictions, any data, any financial information or any
memoranda or offering materials or presentations provided or addressed to
Buyer are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations and
warranties of the Sellers, Blocker, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement (as modified by the Sellers Disclosure
Schedules and Company Disclosure Schedules), Buyer acknowledges and agrees,
on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates and other Representatives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to the Sellers express
disavowal and disclaimer of any other representations and warranties, whether
made by the Sellers, Blocker, the Company or any other Person on behalf of the
Sellers or Blocker, the Company, and of all Liability and responsibility for
any representation, warranty, projections, forecasts or other materials made
available to Buyer, including any opinion, information, projection, forecast
or other information that may have been or may be provided to Buyer by any
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or other Representative of
Blocker, the Company or any of its Affiliates. In furtherance of the
foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, Buyer specifically acknowledges and
agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates and other
Representatives, that none of Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates makes or has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, with respect to any financial projection or forecast delivered to
Buyer with respect to the performance of Blocker, the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries either before or after the Closing Date. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
that (i) such projections or forecasts are being provided solely for
the convenience of Buyer to facilitate its own independent investigation of
Blocker, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, (ii) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections or forecasts,
(iii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and (iv) Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness of the underlying
assumptions). Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
respective Affiliates and other Representatives, that it has conducted to its
satisfaction its own independent investigation of the condition, operations
and businesses of Blocker, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and, in
making their determination to proceed with the Closing, Buyer has been
provided and have evaluated such documents and information as it has deemed
necessary and has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



78

    

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective
Affiliates and other Representatives, that, except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (as modified by the
Sellers Disclosure Schedules and the Company Disclosure Schedules), no other
statutory, express or implied representation or warranty, whether written or
oral, concerning the Membership Interests, Blocker Shares, the Closing or the
business, assets or Liabilities of Blocker, the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or any other matter, including any implied warranties of
merchantability and implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, is
or has been made. Nothing set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall
relieve any party hereunder of any liability for Fraud actually committed
(either by action, inaction or omission) by such party.

 

10.2 _Survival_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall terminate effective as of the Closing and
there shall be no Liability in respect thereof, whether such Liability has
accrued prior to or after the Closing, on the part of any party, its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, except for those
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part at or after the Closing, for which such post-Closing
obligations shall survive in accordance with their terms and, if no term is
specified, then for the longest period permitted by Law and _Article_ __ _
XI_. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this _Section_ __ _
10.2_, no Proceeding will be brought, encouraged, supported or maintained by,
or on behalf of, Buyer or its Affiliates or Blocker, the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries (after the Closing Date) against any of the Sellers or
the Sellers Affiliates and Subsidiaries, and no recourse will be sought or
granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Sellers, Blocker, the Company or
any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement or any other
document contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion,
agreement or other document of the Sellers, Blocker, the Company or any other
Person delivered hereunder, the subject matter of this Agreement or any other
document contemplated hereby, the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the business, the ownership, operation, management, use or control of the
business of Blocker, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, any of
their assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing Date,
except with respect to those covenants and agreements that by their terms
apply or are to be performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing, for
which such post-Closing obligations shall survive in accordance with their
terms and, if no term is specified, then for the longest period permitted by

11.4 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) (i) The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the Closing) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Sellers,
Blocker or the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Sellers, Blocker or the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as
applicable) under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
inadequacy of legal remedy and without bond or other security being required.

 

(ii) The parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the

this Agreement by the other parties and to cause the other parties to

limit such party from seeking to obtain such other remedies. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the equitable
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may

this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the equitable remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ are not available or otherwise are
not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any partys

82

    

 specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article_ __ _ IX_ (and
pursuing monetary damages (and any of the other amounts, as and when due,
owing to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_)) after such
termination to the extent permitted in accordance with this Agreement), nor
shall the commencement of any legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 11.4_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ restrict or limit
any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article_ __ _ IX_ or pursue any other remedies otherwise available under
this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto: (1) except for claims by Buyer against any Debt
Financing Source pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive
documents related thereto, (A) none of the parties hereto nor any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or shareholders shall have any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the Transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (B) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability (whether
in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any party hereto or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or shareholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, and any such actions are disclaimed and released
in full, and (2)(i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in
any Proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in respect of
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, in any forum other
than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
of the City of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in
the any Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Debt Financing

thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York; and
(iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Each Debt
Financing Source is an intended third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __
_ 11.4(b)_ and shall be entitled to the protections of this provision.

 

11.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each party hereto shall pay
its own fees, costs and expenses incident to the negotiation, preparation,
drafting, execution, delivery, performance and closing of this Agreement and

counsel, accountants and other experts.

 



83

    

11.6 _No Right of Set-Off_. Buyer, for itself and for its Affiliates,
successors and permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment or similar rights

may have with respect to any payment to be made by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement or any agreement, certificate, instrument or other document executed
and delivered by Buyer in connection herewith.

 

11.7 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or otherwise modified only by
a written instrument duly executed and delivered by each of (i) Buyer, (ii)
the Company (with the Consent of the Sellers Representative prior to

to Closing) and (iv) the Sellers Representative. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, this _Section_ __ _ 11.7_, _Section_ __ _
11.4(b)_, and the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, (such sections, the
" _Lender Designated Sections_ ") and any definitions used in such Sections
of this Agreement, to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
definition would modify the substance of any Lender Designated Section, may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any
respect to any Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of such
Debt Financing Source.

 

11.8 _Assignments; No Third-Party Rights_.

 

(a) No party hereto may assign, in whole or in part, any of its rights,
interest or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may,
without the prior written consent of any party, (i) assign any or all of its
rights hereunder to any lender of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for
collateral security purposes and (ii) so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party hereto, assign this Agreement or any rights or duties under this
Agreement following the Closing to any Affiliate of Buyer, _provided_ that no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

(b) Except with respect to _Section_ __ _ 11.17_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.18_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except as expressly set forth
herein (including in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_). This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are binding upon, are for the sole and exclusive
benefit of, and are enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt
Financing Source shall be an express and intended third party beneficiary of
the Lender Designated Sections and each of such Sections shall expressly
inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Source and each Debt Financing
Source (and its successors and assigns) shall be entitled to rely on and
enforce the provisions of such Sections.

 



84

    

11.9 _Waiver_. No breach of any provision hereof shall be deemed waived
unless expressly waived in writing by the party hereto who may assert such
breach. No waiver that may be given by a party hereto shall be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given. No waiver of any
provision hereof shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall any such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver, unless otherwise expressly provided therein.
Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided in this
Agreement, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party hereto
in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto
of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. Except as
expressly set forth herein, the rights and remedies of the parties hereto are
cumulative and not alternative.

11.10 _Severability_. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision or provisions shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto, this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never
been contained herein. Upon such a determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under
applicable Law, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

11.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue; No Trial by Jury_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.4(b)_, any and all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or
statute, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including its
statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or
other rule that would result in the application of the laws of a different
jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) shall submit itself to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware
or any Delaware state court having subject matter jurisdiction in the event
any dispute or claim that arises out of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that venue
will be proper as to Proceedings brought in any such court with respect to
such a dispute, (iii) will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (iv) agrees to accept service of process at its address for notices
pursuant to this Agreement in any such action or Proceeding brought in any
such court. With respect to any such action, service of process upon any party
hereto in the manner provided in  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ for the giving of
notices shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon
such party. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives any immunity to
jurisdiction to which it may be entitled or become entitled (including
sovereign immunity, immunity to pre-award attachment, post-award attachment or
otherwise) in any Proceedings against it arising out of or based on this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 



85

    

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 11.11(B)_.

11.12 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. The parties hereto
acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the other
of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to such partys
execution of this Agreement. 

11.13 _Construction_. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been drafted
jointly by the parties hereto. Every term and provision of this Agreement
shall be construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for
or against any party hereto.

11.14  _Incorporation by Reference_. Each Exhibit and Schedule attached
hereto and referred to herein is incorporated in this Agreement by reference
and shall be considered part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein,
unless this Agreement expressly otherwise provides.

11.15 _Headings_. The descriptive headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to describe,
interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or
any provision hereof.

 

11.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed (including by facsimile
transmission or by email of a .pdf attachment) in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that delivery of a signature by facsimile shall constitute
execution by such signatory and will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

11.17 _Sellers_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Seller hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Sellers Representative as its true
and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution to act
in such Sellers name, place and stead with respect to the Transactions, and
all terms and provisions of, this Agreement and to act on such Sellers behalf
in any dispute, litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement and to do
or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and execute all
such agreements, certificates, instruments or other documents, as the
Sellers Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with
the Transactions, including the power:

 

(i) to amend this Agreement, and to waive any condition to the obligations of
such Seller to consummate the Transactions;

 

(ii) to execute and deliver all Ancillary Agreements, certificates,
instruments and other documents, and to make representations and warranties
therein, on behalf of such Seller which the Sellers Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions;

 

(iii) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of such
Seller which the Sellers Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
the sole discretion of the Sellers Representative relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, as fully and completely as such Seller could do if
personally present;

 

(iv) to negotiate and compromise claims and disputes arising under, or
relating to, this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including,
for clarity, any claim or dispute relating to indemnification obligations),
and to sign any releases or other documents in respect of any such claim
or dispute;

(v) to exercise or refrain from exercising any remedy available to Sellers
under this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments and documents
executed in connection herewith;

(vi) to retain such counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as
the Sellers Representative deems necessary to assist it in its performance of
its duties hereunder and to pay all fees and expenses of such counsel and
advisors; and

 

(vii) to exercise all rights and remedies granted to the Sellers
Representative in this Agreement.

 

(b) The appointment of the Sellers Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and is hereby irrevocable, and Buyer may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers in all matters referred to herein. The
Sellers Representative shall act for the Sellers on all of the matters
set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Sellers Representative
reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the Sellers and consistent
with their obligations under this Agreement, and shall not waive, amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement, waive any condition contained herein,

 



87

    

 enter into or execute any agreement, certificate, instrument or other
document, or do or refrain from doing any other act or deed, that has the
effect of adversely and disproportionately impacting any Seller relative to
the other Sellers, in a manner that is inconsistent with the relative rights
of such disproportionately impacted Seller, as the case may be, under this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of such Seller, as applicable.
The Sellers Representative shall not be responsible to the Sellers for any
loss or damages they may suffer by reason of the performance by the Sellers
Representative of the duties of the Sellers Representative under this
Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from a willful and knowing
violation of the Law or this Agreement by the Sellers Representative.

 

(c) Each Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers
Representative from, and promptly reimburse the Sellers Representative for
such Sellers pro rata share of, any loss, damage, fees, costs or expenses
arising from the performance of the duties of the Sellers Representative
hereunder, including the cost of any legal counsel, accountants or other
professional advisors retained by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the
Sellers or otherwise, but excluding any loss or damage arising from a willful
and knowing violation of the Law or this Agreement by the
Sellers Representative.

(d) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers Representative
taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.17_ shall be conclusive and
binding upon each Seller, and no Seller shall have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.17_ are independent and
severable, shall constitute an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an
interest and surviving death or dissolutions, granted by the Sellers to the
Sellers Representative, and shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns of each such Seller.

11.18 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith, by its acceptance of the benefits
of this Agreement, except for Fraud actually committed (either by action,
inaction or omission) by a party hereunder, Buyer covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the Sellers have any Liabilities,
obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether contingent or
otherwise) hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the Sellers or their
respective managing members or general partners may be partnerships or limited
liability companies, Buyer has no right of recovery under this Agreement, or
any claim based on such Liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and no
personal Liability shall attach to, the former, current or future equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers or general or limited partners of any of the
Sellers or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
Affiliate or agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, but not including
the Sellers, each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_"), through any Seller or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of the Company against any Non-Recourse
Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
Proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Law or otherwise. Without
limiting the foregoing, no claim will be brought or maintained by Buyer or
any of their Affiliates or any of their respective successors or permitted
assigns against any Non-

 



88

    

 Recourse Party that is not otherwise expressly identified as a party to this
Agreement, and no recourse will be brought or granted against any of them, by
virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach or nonperformance of any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of any party hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement, any exhibit or schedule thereto, any other document
contemplated hereby or thereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion,
agreement or other document of Blocker, the Company or any other Person
delivered hereunder or thereunder.

 

11.19 _Representation_. Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each
of its respective directors, officers, managers, employees and Affiliates,
that, following the Closing, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" _Kirkland_ ") may serve
as counsel to the Sellers and their controlling Affiliates in connection with
any matters related to this Agreement and the contemplated Transactions,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the contemplated Transactions notwithstanding any
representation by Kirkland prior to the Closing Date of Blocker and
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer, Blocker and the Company and its
Subsidiaries hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have that Kirkland
has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises either
before or after the Closing between Buyer and any of the Sellers or Sellers
controlling Affiliates related to this Agreement and the contemplated
Transactions, Kirkland may represent the Sellers and their controlling
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be
directly adverse to Buyer, Blocker or the Company and its Subsidiaries and
even though Kirkland may have represented Blocker or the Company and its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer, Blocker
and the Company also further agree that, as to all communications prior to
Closing among Kirkland and, the Sellers, Blocker or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, that relate in any way to the Transactions contemplated hereby,
the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
to the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Buyer, Blocker or the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer, Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries and a third party other than
a party to this Agreement after the Closing, Blocker or the Company may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Kirkland to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Blocker or the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Sellers Representative.
