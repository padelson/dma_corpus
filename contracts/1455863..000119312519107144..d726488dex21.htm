and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP (&#147;<U>Kirkland</U>&#148;) may serve as counsel to the Sellers and their controlling Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
contemplated Transactions, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the contemplated Transactions notwithstanding any representation by Kirkland prior to the Closing Date of Blocker and the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer, Blocker and the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby (a)&nbsp;waive any claim they have or may have that Kirkland has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and
(b)&nbsp;agree that, in the event that a dispute arises either before or after the Closing between Buyer and any of the Sellers or Sellers&#146; controlling Affiliates related to this Agreement and the contemplated Transactions, Kirkland may
represent the Sellers and their controlling Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s)&nbsp;may be directly adverse to Buyer, Blocker or the Company and its Subsidiaries and even though Kirkland may have represented
Blocker or the Company and its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer, Blocker and the Company also further agree that, as to all communications prior to Closing among Kirkland and, the Sellers, Blocker or the Company
and its Subsidiaries, that relate in any way to the Transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Buyer, Blocker or the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after
the Closing, Blocker or the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Kirkland to such third party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Blocker or the Company may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers&#146; Representative. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank] </B></P>
