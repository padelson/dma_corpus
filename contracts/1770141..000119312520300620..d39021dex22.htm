Trust Agreement, dated as of June&nbsp;10, 2019, between GigCapital2 and the Trustee (the &#147;<U>Trust Agreement</U>&#148;). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in

There are no separate contracts, agreements, side letters or other understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between GigCapital2 and the Trustee that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the GigCapital2
SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii)&nbsp;to the knowledge of GigCapital2, that would entitle any person (other than stockholders of GigCapital2 who shall have elected to redeem their shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock
