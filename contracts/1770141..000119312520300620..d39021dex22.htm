aggregate basis with respect to all Common Units or Series A Preferred Units
held of record by such person immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) after such aggregation, any fractional share of GigCapital2 Common Stock
that would otherwise be issuable to such person following such aggregation

entitled to receive in exchange therefore, and GigCapital2 shall cause
the Exchange Agent to deliver, the applicable Common Unit Merger
Consideration and Preferred Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01_. The Exchange Agent
shall solicit and each Member shall provide a duly executed and completed IRS

Member pursuant to this Agreement, in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
3.02(h)_. Until submission of a Letter of Transmittal, as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_, each Member shall only be entitled to receive the

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of GigCapital2 Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the GigCapital2 Common Stock with a record date

surrender such Certificate in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_.
Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, GigCapital2 shall pay or cause to be paid

paid with respect to such shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such shares of
GigCapital2 Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Units_. The Common Unit Merger Consideration
and Preferred Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable upon
conversion of the Units in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Units.

 

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Common Unit Merger
Consideration and Preferred Unit Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to
GigCapital2 Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the Members for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to GigCapital2, upon demand, and any Members who have not
theretofore complied with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall thereafter look
only to GigCapital2 for the applicable Common Unit Merger Consideration and
Preferred Unit Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by Members as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of GigCapital2 free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, GigCapital2 or the Surviving
Company shall be liable to any Member for any such Units (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Company,
the Surviving Company and GigCapital2 shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law; _provided_ , however, that other than with
respect to any compensatory payments, (i) at least three (3) Business Days
before making any such deduction or withholding, such withholding party shall
give notice to the recipient of such payment of its intention to make such
deduction or withholding, and (ii) such withholding party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the recipient of such
payment to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Company
and GigCapital2, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (y)
timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority and (z) treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Surviving Company and GigCapital2, as the case may be.

such Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or
after the Effective Time, any Letters of Transmittal presented to the Exchange
Agent or GigCapital2 for any reason shall be converted into the applicable
Common Unit Merger Consideration and Preferred Unit Merger Consideration in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_.

Company and its ERISA Affiliates have performed, in all respects, all
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any respect in

exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code or (ii)
with respect to a preapproved plan, is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to the underlying preapproved
plan, and to the knowledge of Company, no fact or event has occurred since the
date of such determination, opinion or advisory letter or letters from the IRS
that would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of
the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust
by the IRS.

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, there has not been any non-exempt
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) that is reasonably likely to result in material liability of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There have been no acts or omissions
by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates that have given or would

related charges on the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Sections 502
or 4071 of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the Code.

(i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been timely made to the extent due or properly accrued on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,

Company Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
maintains, administers or has any liability (contingent or otherwise) with
respect to a defined benefit plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code
or Title IV of ERISA or other applicable Law. Each Plan required to be funded

by consent or otherwise, a group health plan within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code.

 

 _(k)_ The Company and each Plan that is a "group health plan" as defined in
Section 733(a)(1) of ERISA (each, a " _Health Plan_ ") is and has been in
compliance, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (" _PPACA_ "),
and no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, that
would reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or
any Health Plan to any material liability for penalties or excise taxes under
Code Section 4980D or 4980H or any other provision of the PPACA.

(l) Each Plan that constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been documented, administered and
operated, in all material respects, in good faith compliance with the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, and no additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has
been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by a participant in any
such Plan.

prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade, including the HSR Act (" _Antitrust

SECTION 5.06 _Compliance_. Neither GigCapital2 nor Merger Sub is or has been
in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law

be expected to have a GigCapital2 Material Adverse Effect. Each of GigCapital2
and Merger Sub is in possession of all material franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority

37

    

 respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley

at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each director and executive officer of GigCapital2
has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with respect
to GigCapital2 by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and

all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of GigCapital2 as at the respective

GigCapital2s and Merger Subs business.

controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to GigCapital2 and other material information required to be
disclosed by GigCapital2 in the reports and other documents that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
GigCapital2s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting GigCapital2s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in
GigCapital2s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

 

(f) GigCapital2 maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting
that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for

sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that GigCapital2 maintains
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all
material respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board
of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have
a material effect on its financial statements. GigCapital2 has delivered to
the Company a true and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a
summary thereof) by any representative of GigCapital2 to GigCapital2s
independent auditors relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls
and any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that would adversely affect the ability of GigCapital2 to record,
process, summarize and report financial data. GigCapital2 has no knowledge of
any fraud or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not material, that involve
management or other employees or consultants who have or had a significant

control over financial reporting.

independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by GigCapital2, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that

past practice, and (b) there has not been any GigCapital2 Material Adverse
Effect.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the

SECTION 5.13  _GigCapital2 Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement,
GigCapital2 has no less than $174,272,398.21 in the trust fund established by
GigCapital2 for the benefit of its public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ")
maintained in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Trust
Account_ "). The monies of such Trust Account are invested in United States
Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "
_Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as
of June 10, 2019, between GigCapital2 and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_
"). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is valid and in
full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Remedies Exceptions, and no termination, repudiation,
rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated. GigCapital2
has complied in all material respects with the terms of the Trust Agreement
and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist
under the Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by GigCapital2 or the
Trustee. There are no separate contracts, agreements, side letters or other
understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between
GigCapital2 and the Trustee that would cause the description of the Trust
Agreement in the GigCapital2 SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material
respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of GigCapital2, that would entitle any
person (other than stockholders of GigCapital2 who shall have elected to
redeem their shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock pursuant to the GigCapital2
Organizational Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account.
Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be
released except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any interest
income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of Redemption
Rights in accordance with the provisions of the GigCapital2 Organizational
Documents. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending or, to the
knowledge of GigCapital2, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust
Account. Upon consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee
pursuant to the Trust Agreement, GigCapital2 shall cause the Trustee to, and
the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to GigCapital2 as
promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust
Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the liabilities and obligations of GigCapital2 due and owing
or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due,
including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of GigCapital2 who shall
have exercised their Redemption Rights, (b) with respect to filings,
applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement required
under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with
the Trust Agreement; and (d) to third parties (e.g., professionals,
printers, etc.) who have rendered services to GigCapital2 in connection with
its efforts to effect the Merger and the UpHealth Combination (including fees
owed by GigCapital2 to EarlyBirdCapital, Northland Securities, Inc. and Odeon
Capital Group LLC, pursuant to that certain Business Combination Marketing
Agreement, dated June 5, 2019, among EarlyBirdCapital and GigCapital2). As of
the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company herein and the compliance by the Company with its respective
obligations hereunder, GigCapital2 has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or
funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to GigCapital2 at
the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.14 _Employees_. Other than any officers as described in
the GigCapital2 SEC Reports, GigCapital2 and Merger Sub have never employed

qualify as an exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code (the " _Company
Tax Opinion_ "). In rendering such opinion, such third party counsel or firm
may rely on the representation letters and such other information as it
considers relevant. Such opinion shall be in a form customary for transactions
of this nature and shall be subject to customary assumptions, qualifications,
limitations and representations.

(i) _GigCapital2 Stockholders  Approval_. The GigCapital2 Extension Proposal
shall have been approved and adopted by the requisite affirmative vote of the
stockholders of GigCapital2 in accordance with the GigCapital2 Extension Proxy
Statement, the DGCL, the GigCapital2 Organizational Documents and the rules
and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.

(j) _Escrow Agreement_. The Escrow Agreement shall be in full force and
effect, and the Significant UpHealth Stockholders shall not have attempted to
repudiate or disclaim any of their obligations thereunder.

 

(k) _Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement_. The Registration Rights and
Lock-Up Agreement shall have been duly executed and delivered by all such
parties thereto.

warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement;  _provided_ _further_
that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company,
GigCapital2 may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
9.01(f)_ for so long as the Company continues to exercise its reasonable
efforts to cure such breach, unless such breach is not cured within thirty
(30) days after notice of such breach is provided by GigCapital2 to the

Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of GigCapital2 or Merger Sub
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.03(a)_ and _8.03(b)_ would not be satisfied (" _Terminating
GigCapital2 Breach_ "); _provided_ that the Company has not waived such
Terminating GigCapital2 Breach and the Company is not then in material breach
of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if such Terminating GigCapital2
Breach is curable by GigCapital2 and Merger Sub, the Company may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(g)_ for so long as GigCapital2
and Merger Sub continue to exercise their reasonable efforts to cure such
breach, unless such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice
of such breach is provided by the Company to GigCapital2; or

 

(h) by the Company if there are less than $125,000,000 of cash and cash
equivalents in the Trust Fund at any time prior to the Closing.

in the case of termination subsequent to a willful material breach of this

SECTION 10.02 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any
breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and
all such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Closing (and
there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for
(a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with
respect to any breaches occurring after the Closing and (b) this _Article X_
and any corresponding definitions set forth in _Article I_.

SECTION 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 10.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.04(b)_, all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise) by any party
without the prior express written consent of the other parties hereto.

SECTION 10.05 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ (which is intended
to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by
such persons).

 

SECTION 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All legal actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court; _provided_ , that if
jurisdiction is not then available in the Delaware Chancery Court, then any
such legal Action may be brought in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties hereto hereby (a)
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
themselves and with respect to their respective properties for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party
hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any Action relating thereto except in
the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the parties further waive any argument that

 



58

    

 such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

SECTION 10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section_ __ _ 10.07_.

 

SECTION 10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

SECTION 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger)
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if that court does not
have jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity as expressly
permitted in this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

SECTION 10.11 _Waiver of Conflicts; Retention of Privilege_. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Sidley Austin LLP (" _Sidley_ ")
has acted as counsel to the Company in various matters involving a range of
issues and as counsel to the Company in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. In connection with any matter or dispute
under this Agreement, GigCapital2 hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to
assert, and agree to cause the Surviving Corporation to irrevocably waive and
not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with
Sidleys prior representation of the Company or any holders of Company Capital
Stock (collectively, the " _Company Advised Parties_ ") prior to and after
the Closing. GigCapital2 further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the
Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, that all communications in
any form or format whatsoever between or among any of Sidley, the Company, any
of the Company Advised Parties, or any of their respective Representatives
that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, beginning on the date of
this Agreement, any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Company Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned
collectively by the Company Advised Parties and shall not pass to or be
claimed by GigCapital2 or the Surviving Corporation. All Company Deal
Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged Company
Deal Communications_ ") shall remain privileged after the Closing and the
privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to the Company Advised Parties, on behalf of the Company and
shall not pass to or be claimed by GigCapital2 or the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be
a waiver by the GigCapital2 or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates) of any
applicable privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent
disclosure of any such communications to any third party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between GigCapital2 or the
Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Representative or the Sponsor on the other hand, 

 



59

    

 GigCapital2 or the Surviving Corporation may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Company Deal
Communications to such third party. To the extent that files or other
materials maintained by Sidley constitute property of its clients, only the
Company Advised Parties shall hold such property rights and Sidley shall have
no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or
any Privileged Company Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Sidley, on the one hand, and the Surviving Corporation,
on the other hand so long as such files or other materials would be subject to
a privilege or protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an
unrelated third party. GigCapital2 agrees on behalf of itself and the
Surviving Corporation, (i) to the extent that GigCapital2 or the Surviving
Corporation receives or takes physical possession of any Company Deal
Communications, (a) such physical possession or receipt shall not, in any way,
be deemed a waiver by any of the Company Advised Parties, or any other Person,
of the privileges or protections described in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_,
and (b) neither GigCapital2 nor the Surviving Corporation shall assert any
claim that any of the Company Advised Parties or any other Person waived the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or any other
right or expectation of client confidence applicable to any such materials or
communications, (ii) not to access or use the Company Deal Communications,
including by way of review of any electronic data, communications or other
information, or by otherwise asserting that GigCapital2 or the Surviving
Corporation has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege, and
(iii) not to seek to obtain the Company Deal Communications from Sidley so
long as such Company Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or
protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third
party.

 

SECTION 10.12 Representative.

 

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
Member shall be deemed to have approved the designation of, and hereby
designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Representative as
of the Closing for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto.

 

(b) The Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any
action or omission by the Representative in connection with the
Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative
shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of
counsel. The Members will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative, the
Representative will reimburse the Members the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative by the Members,
any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Representative from (i)
the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) any other funds that become payable to
the Members under this Agreement at such time as such amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Members; provided, that while this section allows the
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Members from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In no event will the Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Members or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability
or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse
against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Members set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities
will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Representative or
the termination of this Agreement.

 



60

    

(c) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire US$150,000 (the " _Expense Fund_
") to the Representative, which will be used for the purposes of paying
directly, or reimbursing the Representative for, any third party expenses
pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Members
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative will
hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Representatives responsibilities, the Representative shall cause (at
the Members expense) the disbursement of any remaining balance of the
Expense Fund to the Members based on such Members pro rata portions thereof,
except in the case of payments to employees or former employees of the Company
for which employment tax withholding is required, which such amounts shall be
delivered to GigCapital2 or the Surviving Company and paid through
GigCapital2s or Surviving Companys payroll processing service or system. For
tax purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Members at the time of Closing. The parties agree
that the Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Fund.

EXHIBIT A

 

MEMBER SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

MEMBER SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of November 20, 2020 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among GigCapital2, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _GigCapital2_
"), and certain of the members of Cloudbreak Health, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Company_ "), whose names appear on the signature
pages of this Agreement (each, a " _Member_ " and, collectively, the "
_Members_ ").

WHEREAS, GigCapital2, Cloudbreak Health Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital2 (" _Merger Sub_
"), and the Company propose to enter into, concurrently herewith, a Business
Combination Agreement in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit_ __ _ B_ (the
" _BCA_ "; terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the BCA), which provides, among other things,
that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will
be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital2; and

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Member owns of record the number of
Common Units of the Company and Series A Preferred Units of the Company as
set forth opposite such Members name on _ Exhibit A_ hereto (all such Common
Units and Series A Preferred Units and any Common Units and Series A Preferred
Units of which ownership of record or the power to vote is hereafter acquired
by the Members prior to the termination of this Agreement being referred to
herein as the " _Units_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1. _Agreement to Vote_. Each Member, by this Agreement, with respect to such Members Shares, severally and not jointly, hereby agrees to vote, at any meeting of the members of the Company, and in any action by written consent of the members of the Company (which written consent shall be delivered promptly, and in any event within twenty four (24) hours, after the Company requests such delivery), all of such Members Units held by such Member at such time (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the BCA and approval of the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by the BCA and (b) against any action, agreement or transaction or proposal that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the BCA or that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the Merger from being consummated. Each Member acknowledges receipt and review of a copy of the BCA. 

 

2. _Termination of LLC Agreement, Related Agreements_. Each Member, by this Agreement, with respect to such Members Units, severally and not jointly, hereby terminates, subject to and effective immediately prior to the Closing under the BCA (provided that all Terminating Rights (as defined below) between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any other holder of Company capital stock shall also terminate at such time), that certain (a) First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2016, by and among the Company and the members of the Company named therein (as amended, modified or supplemented, the " _LLC Agreement_ ") and (b) if applicable to Member, any rights under any letter agreement providing for redemption rights, put rights, purchase rights or other similar rights not generally available to members of the Company (the " _Terminating Rights_ ") between Member and the Company, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any rights such Member may have that relate to any commercial or employment agreements or arrangements between such Member and the Company or any subsidiary, which shall survive in accordance with their terms. 

   

3. _Transfer of Units_. Each Member severally and not jointly, agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer (including by operation of law), lien, pledge, dispose of or otherwise encumber any of the Units or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing, except for a sale, assignment or transfer pursuant to the BCA or to another member of the Company that is a party to this Agreement and bound by the terms and obligations hereof, (b) deposit any Units into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect acquisition or sale, assignment, transfer (including by operation of law) or other disposition of any Units; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the transfer of the Units to an affiliate of Member, but only if such affiliate of such Member shall execute this Agreement or a joinder agreeing to become a party to this Agreement. 

 

4. _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

of the BCA, GigCapital2 is entering into a business combination agreement
with UpHealth Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _UpHealth_ "), and
UpHealth Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (such business combination
agreement, the " _UpHealth BCA_ ," and such business combination, the "
_UpHealth Combination_ );

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the BCA; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of GigCapital2 and
the Company to enter into the BCA, GigCapital2, the Company and the Sponsor
are entering into this Agreement.

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the Sponsor, GigCapital2 and the Company hereby agree
as follows:

 

1. _Voting Agreement_. The Sponsor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that, at the GigCapital2 Stockholders Meeting, at any other meeting of the stockholders of GigCapital2 (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting, however called and including any adjournment or postponement thereof) and in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of GigCapital2, the Sponsor shall: 

 

a. when such meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause
all shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock or any other voting securities of
GigCapital2 which it holds, owns or is entitled to vote, whether as shares or
as a constituent part of a unit of securities and whether owned as of the date
of or later acquired (the " _Sponsor Shares_ "), to be counted as present
thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum;

 

b. vote (or execute and return an action by written consent), or cause
to be voted at such meeting (or validly execute and return and cause such
consent to be granted with respect to), all of the Sponsor Shares in favor of
(i) the approval and adoption of the BCA and approval of the Merger and all
other transactions contemplated by the BCA and (ii) against any action,
agreement or transaction or proposal that would result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
GigCapital2 under the BCA or that would reasonably be expected to result in
the failure of the Merger from being consummated and (iii) each of the
proposals and any other matters necessary or reasonably requested by
GigCapital2 for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the BCA, including the UpHealth Combination; and

c. vote (or execute and return an action by written consent), or cause
to be voted at such meeting (or validly execute and return and cause such
consent to be granted with respect to), all of the Sponsor Shares against (i)
any Alternative Transaction (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes the

that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially impede, interfere with,
delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the BCA, or (y) result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the
Sponsor contained in this Agreement.

   

2. _Transfer of Shares_. Except as otherwise contemplated by the BCA or this Agreement, the Sponsor agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) offer for sale, sell, assign, transfer (including by operation of law), create any lien or pledge, dispose of or otherwise encumber any of the Sponsor Shares or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing, (b) deposit any Sponsor Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking requiring the direct acquisition or sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any Sponsor Shares. 

 

3. _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

Sponsor shall, and shall cause its affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any person (other than with the Company, UpHealth, its and their stockholders and their respective affiliates and Representatives) conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, an Alternative Transaction. If the Sponsor receives any inquiry or proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction, then Sponsor shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after the Sponsor becomes aware of such inquiry or proposal) notify such person in writing that GigCapital2 is subject to an exclusivity agreement with respect to the Merger that prohibits Sponsor from considering such inquiry or proposal. 

 

4. _Representations and Warranties of the Sponsor_. The Sponsor hereby represents and warrants to GigCapital2 and the Company as follows:

2

    

e. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Sponsor does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby

UpHealth BCA will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of,
or a default under, the limited liability company agreement or similar
governing documents of the Sponsor, (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) of
or a default under, the loss of any benefit under, the creation, modification
or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of
the properties, rights or assets of the Sponsor pursuant to any contract
binding upon the Sponsor or (iii) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any contract legally binding upon the Sponsor, except, in the
case of clause (ii) or (iii) directly above, for any such breach, violation,
termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impair the Sponsors ability to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the BCA
or the UpHealth BCA.

 

f. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, proceeding or
investigation pending against the Sponsor or, to the knowledge of the
Sponsor, threatened against the Sponsor that questions the beneficial or
record ownership of the Sponsor Shares, the validity of this Agreement or the

ARTICLE II

REGISTRATION 

Section 2.1 Demand Registration

 

2.1.1 _Initial Registration_. The Company shall include the Registrable
Securities in a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (a "Form S-1 Registration
Statement"), which the Company shall file as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, for the
purpose of permitting the public resale of all the Registrable Securities held
by the Holders from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under the
Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) ("Rule 415") on the terms and conditions specified
in this _subsection 2.1.1_ and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such Registration Statement to be declared effective as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the initial filing thereof, but in no event later than sixty
(60) business days following the filing deadline (the "Effectiveness
Deadline"); _provided_ , that the Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to
one hundred and twenty (120) days after the filing deadline if the
Registration Statement is reviewed by, and receives comments from, the
Commission. To the extent that the Company does not include the Registrable
Securities in the above-mentioned Form S-1 Registration Statement, the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this _subsection
2.1.1_ shall be a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (a "Form S-3
Shelf") or, if Form S-3 is not then available to the Company, a Form S-1
Registration Statement or such other form of registration statement as is
then available to effect a registration for resale of such Registrable
Securities, covering such Registrable Securities, and shall contain a
Prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 at any time beginning on the effective date
for such Registration Statement. A Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall provide for the resale of
Registrable Securities included therein pursuant to any method or combination
of methods legally available to, and requested prior to effectiveness by, the
Holders. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ to remain
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,
that another Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. When effective, a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_
(including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to
form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the
case of any Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement, in the light
of the circumstances under which such statement is made). If the Company
files a Form S-3 Shelf and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to use
Form S-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to file a Form S-1 Registration Statement as promptly as reasonably
practicable to replace the shelf registration statement that is a Form S-3
Shelf and have the Form S-1 Registration Statement declared effective as
promptly as reasonably practicable and to cause such Form S-1 Registration
Statement to remain effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the
extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or,
if not available, that another Registration Statement is available, for the
resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such
Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities.

2.1.2 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __
_ 2.1.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ hereof, at any time and from time to time
on or after the Closing Date, the Holders holding at least a majority in
interest of the then-outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by all
the Holders (such Holders, the "Demanding Holders"), may make a written demand
to the Company for the Registration under the Securities Act to sell all or
part of their Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering, including a
Block Trade (such written demand, a "Demand Registration"). The Demanding
Holders shall have the right to select the Underwriters for such offering
(which shall consist of one or more reputable nationally recognized
investment banks), subject to the Companys prior approval (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall, within five
(5) days of the Companys receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in
writing, all other Holders of Registrable Securities of such demand, and each
Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a
portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration
(each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such Holders Registrable
Securities in such Registration, a "Requesting Holder") shall so notify the
Company, in writing, within five (5) days after the receipt by the Holder of
the notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any such written
notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the Company, such Requesting
Holder(s) shall be entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in
a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration, subject to provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.1.3_. Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated
to effect more than an aggregate of two (2) Registrations pursuant to a
Demand Registration under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1.2_ initiated by Holders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Demand
Registration shall not be counted for such purposes unless a Registration
Statement that may be available at such time has become effective and all of
the Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders to be registered
on behalf of the Demanding Holders in such Registration Statement have been
sold, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ of this Agreement. All such
Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1.2_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating the Demand Registration.

 

2.1.3 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter(s)
for a Demand Registration that is to be an Underwritten Offering, in good
faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders
in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities which
the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell,
taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other equity
securities which the Company desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock,
if any, as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to separate
written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders
of the Company who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten
Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing,
the distribution method, or the probability of success of such Underwritten
Offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of securities, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) (pro
rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in
such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities that the Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders have requested
be included in such Underwritten Registration (such proportion is referred to
herein as "Pro Rata")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the
Registrable Securities of Holders (Pro Rata, based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that each Holder has so requested) exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2.1_ hereof, without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (iii)
third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Common Stock or other
equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (iv) fourth, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Common Stock or other equity
securities of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated to
register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

2.1.4 _Demand Registration Withdrawal_. A majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration pursuant to a Registration
under _Section_ __ _ 2.1.1_ shall have the right to withdraw from a
Registration pursuant to such Demand Registration for any or no reason
whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter(s) of
their intention to withdraw from such Registration prior to the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to the
Registration of their Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand
Registration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1.4_.

 

Section 2.2 Piggy-Back Registration.

 

2.2.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If, at any time on or after the Closing Date,
the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities
Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity
securities, by the Company for its own account or for stockholders of the
Company for their account (or by the Company and by stockholders of the
Company including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_),
other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee
stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of
securities solely to the Companys existing stockholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company,
or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall (x) give
written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable
Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days
before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount
and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s)
of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within five (5) days following receipt of such notice (a "Piggyback
Registration"). The Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such Registration and shall use its best efforts
to cause the managing Underwriter(s) of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.

through a Piggyback Registration that involves an Underwriter(s) shall

stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

selected by a majority of the participating Holders), the Underwriters, if

participate, at each such persons own expense, in the preparation of the

employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the
Registration; _provided_ , that such representatives or Underwriters enter
into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of any such
information;

3.1.12 obtain a "comfort" letter from the Companys independent
registered public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration,
in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by

be found reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the
participating Holders;

 

3.1.13 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to
the Holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters,
if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the Registration in

selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as

marketing costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of
"Registration Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
representing the Holders.

 



10

    

Section 3.3 Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No
person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder
unless such person or entity (i) agrees to sell such persons or entitys
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Company and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements
and other customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting arrangements.

 

Section 3.4 Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus
contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until such Holder has received copies of
a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplemented or amended Prospectus as soon as practicable after the time of
such notice), or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company
that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any
Registration at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Companys control, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the
shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose. In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration
in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The
Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period
during which it exercised its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and
upon the expiration of such period the Holders shall be entitled to resume
the use of any such Prospectus in connection with any sale or offer to sell
Registrable Securities, and upon the expiration of such period the Holders
shall be entitled to resume the use of any such Prospectus in connection with
any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities.

 

Section 3.5 Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be reporting
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to
_Sections_ __ _ 13(a)_ or _15(d)_ of the Exchange Act and to promptly
furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The
Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any
Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal
opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such
Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

 

Section 4.1 Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to
indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, and hold harmless each Holder of
Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person who
controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) from and
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of them, or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
the same is contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company
by the Holder expressly for use therein. The Company also shall indemnify any
Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and
each person who controls such Underwriter (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification of the Holder provided in this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_.

 



11

    

Section 4.2 __ Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities. In
connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in
writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests
for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and,
to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and
officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys
fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact contained or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained or incorporated by reference in any
information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for
use therein; _provided_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several,
not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the
liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion
to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale
of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Each
Holder shall indemnify any Underwriter of Registrable Securities sold by such
Holder, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

 

Section 4.3 Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any person entitled
to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
(provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any persons
right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not
materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such
indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim,
permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (plus any local counsel)
for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such
claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict
of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall,
without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects
by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation.

 

Section 4.4 Survival. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.
The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an
offering also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by
any indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Companys or such Holders indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

Section 4.5 Contribution. If the indemnification provided under _Section_
__ _ 4.1_ hereof from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient
to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified
party, and the indemnifying partys and indemnified partys relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action; _provided_ , that the liability of any Holder under this _Section_ __
_ 4.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

ARTICLE VI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 6.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including  _Schedule A_
hereto) constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
as to the matters covered herein and supersedes and replaces any prior
understanding, agreement or statement of intent, in each case, written or
oral, of any and every nature with respect thereto.

Section 6.2 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) upon transmission, if sent by facsimile

other address, email address or facsimile numbers as may be designated
in writing hereafter, in the same manner, by any such person.

Section 6.3 Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be
assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Holders hereunder may be freely
assigned or delegated by such Holder in conjunction with and to the extent of
any transfer of Common Stock by any such Holder. This Agreement and the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of each of the parties and the permitted assigns of the applicable Holder or
of any assignee of the applicable Holder. This Agreement is not intended to
confer any rights or benefits on any persons that are not party hereto other
than as expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. No
assignment by any party hereto of such partys rights, duties and obligations
hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate the Company unless and until the
Company shall have received (i) written notice of such assignment and (ii)
the written agreement of the assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement (which
may be accomplished by an addendum or certificate of joinder to this
Agreement).

 

Section 6.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that

delivered by the parties hereto via facsimile or electronic transmission. The
words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in this
Agreement or in any other certificate, agreement or document related to this
Agreement shall include images of manually executed signatures transmitted by
facsimile or other electronic format (including, without limitation, "pdf",

record-keeping system to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act and any
other applicable law, including, without limitation, any state law based on

Section 6.5 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified,
and any provision hereof may be waived, in whole or in part, at any time
pursuant to an agreement in writing executed by the Company and Holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities at such time;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver
hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in his, her or its capacity
as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a manner that
is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity) shall
require the consent of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing between
any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure or delay
on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or remedies
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of
any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver or
preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder
by such party.

 

Section 6.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.

 

Section 6.7 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by,
interpreted under, and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed within the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice-of-law provisions
thereof that would compel the application of the substantive laws of any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 6.8 Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative. Each party
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties hereto would be irreparably
harmed and would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by such first party in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by such first
party. Accordingly, each party agrees that the other parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such parties are entitled at
law or in equity. None of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this
Agreement shall be mutually exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or remedy,
whether conferred by this Agreement or now or hereafter available at law, in
equity, by statute or otherwise.

 

Section 6.9 Other Registration Rights. Other than the Warrant Agreement
dated June 10, 2019 between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company as warrant agent (the "Warrant Agreement"), the UpHealth Holding
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 5, 2019,
between the Company, the shareholders named therein and certain of the
Companys then executive officers and directors, the Company represents and
warrants that no person, other than a Holder of Registrable Securities,
has any right to require the Company to register any securities of the
Company for sale or to include such securities of the Company in any
Registration Statement filed by the Company for the sale of securities for its
own account or for the account of any other person. Further, the Company
represents and warrants that this Agreement supersedes any other registration
rights agreement or agreement with similar terms and conditions and in the
event of a conflict between any such agreement or agreements and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. The Company will not
grant any person any registration rights with respect to the capital stock of
the Company that are prior in right or in conflict or inconsistent with
the rights of the Holders as set forth in this Agreement in any material
respect (it being understood that this shall not preclude the grant of
additional demand and piggyback registration rights in and of themselves so
long as such rights are not prior in right to the rights under this
Agreement).

of the stockholders of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except
as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the shares of
Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred
Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding
series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred
Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or
more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

(b) _Dividends._ Subject to applicable law, the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, the holders of the
shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other
distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the Corporation)
when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time out of any
assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and shall share
equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions.

 

(c) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation._ Subject
to applicable law, the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding
series of the Preferred Stock, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after payment or
provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation,
the holders of the shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all the
remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock
held by them.

Section 4.4 _Rights and Options_. The Corporation has the authority to
create and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof
to acquire from the Corporation any shares of its capital stock of any class
or classes, with such rights, warrants and options to be evidenced by or in
instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is empowered to set the
exercise price, duration, times for exercise and other terms and conditions of
such rights, warrants or options; provided, however, that the consideration to
be received for any shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise thereof
may not be less than the par value thereof.

ARTICLE V

 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as
they may be amended from time to time, " _Bylaws_ "), the Board is hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any
Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that
no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall
invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

 

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by
the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into
three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I,
Class II, and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the
Board already in office to Class I, Class II, or Class III. The term of the
initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors
shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate, and the term of the initial Class III directors shall expire at
the third annual meeting of the stockholders following the effectiveness of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first
annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the
successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at
that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the
election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject
to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section_ __ _
5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors that constitutes the Board is changed,
any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes
so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as
possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to
the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one
or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions
thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid
classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and
therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

 

(c) Subject to _ Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office
until the next annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires
and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject,
however, to such directors earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal.

 

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to _
Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an
increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting
from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause
may be filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining
directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director (and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which
the new directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his
or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to
such directors earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

 

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _ Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, any or
all of the directors may be removed from office, but only for cause, by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, at
a meeting called for that purpose.

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _ Article_ __ _ V_, and except as otherwise required by
law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall
have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms
of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such
directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this
_ Article_ __ _ V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

ARTICLE VI

 

BYLAWS

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total
number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at
which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may
be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the
Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or
by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the
Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided
further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been
valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted. 

ARTICLE VII

 

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

 

Section 7.1 _Special Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the
requirements of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer of the Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by
a majority of the Board, and the ability of the stockholders of the
Corporation to call a special meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except as
provided in the foregoing sentence, special meetings of stockholders of
the Corporation may not be called by another person or persons.

Section 7.2 _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations
for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders
before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in
the manner provided in the Bylaws.

 

Section 7.3 _Action by Written Consent_. Except as may be otherwise
provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights
of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must
be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders
and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders of the
Corporation.

ARTICLE VIII

 

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
unless a director violated his or her duty of loyalty to the Corporation or
its stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the
law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from its actions as
a director. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "
_indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to
the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section
8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_, except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

 

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this  _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders
of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other
provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with
this _Section 8.2_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a
retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way
diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of
such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect
of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened,
commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission
occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent
provision.

 



5

    

(d) This _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to
the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and
to advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

 

Section 9.1 _Corporate Opportunities and_ __ _ Non-Employee_ __ _
Directors_.

 

(a) In recognition and anticipation that members of the Board who are not
employees of the Corporation (the "Non-Employee Directors") and their
respective Affiliates may now engage and may continue to engage in the same or
similar activities or related lines of business as those in which
the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business
activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, may engage, the provisions of this __ _ Article IX_
are set forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the
Corporation with respect to certain classes or categories of business
opportunities as they may involve any of the Non-Employee Directors or their
respective Affiliates and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the
Corporation and its directors, officers and stockholders in connection
therewith. For purposes of this __ _Article IX_ , (i) "Affiliate" shall mean,
(a) in respect of each Non-Employee Director, any Person that, directly or
indirectly, is controlled by such Non-Employee Director (other than the
Corporation and any entity that is controlled by the Corporation) and (b) in
respect of the Corporation, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is
controlled by the Corporation; and (ii) "Person" shall mean any individual,
corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, trust, association or any other entity.

(b) No Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who
serves as an officer of the Corporation in both his or her director and
officer capacities) or his or her Affiliates (such Persons being referred to,
collectively, as "Identified Persons" and, individually, as an "Identified
Person") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have any duty to
refrain from directly or indirectly (1) engaging in the same or similar
business activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or any of
its Affiliates now engages or proposes to engage or (2) otherwise competing
with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, no Identified Person shall be liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person
engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right to be
offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity which may
be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and the Corporation or any
of its Affiliates, except as provided in __ _Section 9.1(c)_ of this __ _
Article IX_. Subject to said __ _Section 9.1(c)_ of this __ _Article IX_,
in the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or other business opportunity which may be a
corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself and the Corporation or
any of its Affiliates, such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or
other business opportunity to the Corporation or any of its Affiliates and,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation
solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires
such corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or
directs such corporate opportunity to another Person.

 

(c) The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee
Director who serves as an officer of this Corporation) if such opportunity is
expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director
or officer of the Corporation, and the provisions of ___Section 9.1(b)_ of
this __ _ Article IX_ shall not apply to any such corporate opportunity.

(d) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this __
_ Article IX_, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is unable, financially or legally, or is
not contractually permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the
line of the Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy.

 



6

    

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing
or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
provisions of this __ _ Article IX_.

 

(f) Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this
_Article IX_ , nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent
with this _Article IX_ , shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this _Article
IX_ in respect of any corporate opportunity first identified or any other
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this
_Article IX_ , would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment,
addition, repeal or adoption.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other
provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in
force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed
by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as
set forth in __ _ Article_ __ _ VIII_, all rights, preferences and
privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or
any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to
the right reserved in this __ _ Article_ __ _ X_.

 

ARTICLE XI

EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS

Section 11.1 _Forum._ Unless the Corporation consents in writing to
the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including
a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of
a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim
against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the
internal affairs doctrine and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder
bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on
such stockholders counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable
party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the
indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is
vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject
matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this __
_ Section_ __ _ 11.1_ will not apply to suits brought to enforce any
liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which
the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the federal district courts of the United States of America, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, shall be the sole and exclusive forum for
the resolution of any action asserting a cause of action arising under the
Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of
and consented to the provisions of this Section 11.1.

Section 11.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter
of which is within the scope of _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ immediately above is
filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "
_Foreign Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be
deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_
immediately above (an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having service of
process made upon such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by
service upon such stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for
such stockholder.
