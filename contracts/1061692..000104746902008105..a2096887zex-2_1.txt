and without any action on the part of a holder of Equity Interests of Company or
Merger Sub:

            (a) Each share of Parent Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and
shall be unchanged by the Merger.

            (b) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock held in a fiduciary (including custodial or agency) capacity or as
a result of debts previously contracted in good faith) held of record
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or
any Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent shall be canceled and retired at the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

            (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON
STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and retired at the Effective Time and automatically converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par
value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of a
number of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to evidence
ownership of the same number of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

            (d) (1) Subject to Sections 3.03, 3.06, 3.07, and 3.08, each share

Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
3.01(b)) shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the
right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof:

                 (i) 1.257 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "PER SHARE STOCK

this Agreement pursuant to and under the circumstances set forth in Section

Stock Consideration as described in such Section 9.01(h).

                                     - 11 -

            (a) Parent shall designate an exchange agent to act as agent (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT") for purposes of conducting the election procedure and the
exchange procedure described in Sections 3.03 and 3.04. Provided that the
Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all
information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations
as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall, no later than the twenty-fifth
(25th) Business Day prior to the anticipated Effective Date, mail or make
available to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates

                 (i) a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall specify
            that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
            Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock
            shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
            Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
            Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such
            Certificate or Certificates in exchange for the consideration set
            forth in Section 3.01(d) hereof deliverable in respect thereof
            pursuant to this Agreement and

                 (ii) an election form in such form as Parent and the Company
            shall mutually agree (the "ELECTION FORM").

            (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or in the case of
nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation)

                 (i) to elect to receive Parent Common Stock with respect to all
            of such holder's Company Common Stock as hereinabove provided (the
            "STOCK ELECTION SHARES"),

                 (ii) to elect to receive cash with respect to all of such
            holder's Company Common Stock as hereinabove provided (the "CASH
            ELECTION SHARES"),

                 (iii) to elect to receive Parent Common Stock with respect to
            part of such holder's Company Common Stock and to receive cash with
            respect to the remaining part of such holder's Company Common Stock
            as hereinabove provided (a "MIXED ELECTION"), or

                 (iv) to indicate that such holder makes no such election with
            respect to such holder's shares of Company Common Stock (the
            "NO-ELECTION SHARES").

            (c) With respect to each holder of Company Common Stock who makes a
Mixed Election, the shares of Company Common Stock such holder elects to be
converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock shall be treated as
Stock Election Shares and the shares such holder elects to be converted into the
right to receive cash shall be treated as Cash Election Shares for purposes of
the provisions contained in Sections 3.03(b), 3.03(g) and 3.03(h). Nominee
record holders who hold Company Common Stock on behalf of multiple beneficial
owners shall indicate how many of the shares held by them are Stock Election
Shares, Cash Election Shares and No-Election Shares.

            (d) If a shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed
Election Form

                                     - 12 -
<Page>

prior to the Election Deadline or (ii) revokes an Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline and does not resubmit a properly completed Election Form prior
to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
shareholder shall be designated No-Election Shares. Any Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed to be Cash Election Shares, and with respect to such shares the
holders thereof shall in no event be classified as Reallocated Stock Shares.

            (e) The term "ELECTION DEADLINE" shall mean 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,
on the 20th Business Day following but not including the date of mailing of the
Election Form or such other date as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree
upon.

            (f) Any election to receive Parent Common Stock or cash shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form will
be properly completed only if accompanied by Certificates representing all
shares of Company Common Stock covered thereby, subject to the provisions of
Section 3.04(c). Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to the
Exchange Agent only if such written notice is actually received by the Exchange
Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. The Certificate or Certificates
representing Company Common Stock relating to any revoked Election Form shall be
promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form to
the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine when any election, modification or revocation is received, whether any
such election, modification or revocation has been properly made and to
disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions
of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.
Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

            (g) Within seven (7) Business Days after the Election Deadline, the
Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock
of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance
with the Election Forms as follows:

                 (i) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share
            Cash Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration,
            then:

                       (1) all Cash Election Shares (subject to Section 3.07
                 with respect to Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
                 right to receive cash,

                       (2) No-Election Shares shall then be deemed to be Cash
                 Election Shares to the extent necessary to have the total
                 number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash
                 Consideration equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. If less
                 than all of the No-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash
                 Election Shares, then the Exchange Agent shall select which
                 No-Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares in
                 such manner as the Exchange Agent shall determine, and all
                 remaining No-Election Shares shall thereafter be treated as
                 Stock Election Shares,

                       (3) If all of the No-Election Shares are treated as Cash
                 Election Shares under the preceding subsection, and the total
                 number of Cash Election Shares (including such No-Election
                 Shares treated as such) times

                                     - 13 -
<Page>

                 the Per Share Cash Consideration remains less than the
                 Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall
                 convert on a pro rata basis as described below a sufficient
                 number of Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares
                 ("REALLOCATED CASH SHARES") such that the sum of the number of
                 Cash Election Shares plus the number of Reallocated Cash Shares
                 times the Per Share Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate
                 Cash Consideration, and all Reallocated Cash Shares will be
                 converted into the right to receive cash, and

                       (4) the Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated
                 Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Parent
                 Common Stock.

                 (ii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share
            Cash Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration,
            then:

                       (1) all Stock Election Shares and all No-Election Shares
                 shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Common
                 Stock,

                       (2) the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis
                 as described below a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares
                 (excluding any Dissenting Shares) ("REALLOCATED STOCK SHARES")
                 such that the number of remaining Cash Election Shares
                 (including Dissenting Shares) times the Per Share Cash
                 Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all
                 Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to
                 receive Parent Common Stock, and

                       (3) the Cash Election Shares (subject to Section 3.07
                 with respect to Dissenting Shares) which are not Reallocated
                 Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash.

                 (iii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share
            Cash Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Cash Consideration,
            then Sections 3.03(g)(i) and 3.03(g)(ii) above shall not apply and
            all No-Election Shares and all Stock Election Shares will be
            converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock.

            (h) For purposes of the calculations in Section 3.03(g), Company
Common Stock held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other than in a fiduciary
capacity shall be deemed Cash Election Shares without regard to whether an
Election Form has been submitted with respect to such shares, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such shares shall in no event be classified as Reallocated Stock Shares. In
the event that the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 3.03(g)(i)(3)
to convert some Stock Election Shares into Reallocated Cash Shares, each holder
of Stock Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the total
Reallocated Cash Shares. In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to
Section 3.03(g)(ii)(2) to convert some Cash Election Shares into Reallocated
Stock Shares, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata
portion of the total Reallocated Stock Shares.

            (i) If the tax opinion referred to in Section 8.01(e) cannot be
rendered (as

                                     - 14 -
<Page>

reasonably determined by Foley Hoag LLP) as a result of the Merger potentially
failing to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, then
Parent shall reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and correspondingly increase the number
of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration by the minimum amount necessary to enable such tax opinion to be
rendered.

     3.04. EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.

            (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates
evidencing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and the
Aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this Article III in exchange
for Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of
the Persons entitled thereto.

            (b) After completion of the allocation referred to in Section
3.03(g), each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon
acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to a certificate or
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and/or the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and, if such
holder's shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into Parent Common
Stock, any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to Parent Common
Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case without interest. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding
Certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented Company Common Stock
and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until
duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent be deemed to evidence ownership of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock or the right to receive the amount of
cash into which such Company Common Stock shall have been converted. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company
of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and if such
Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled
against delivery of certificates for Parent Common Stock or cash as hereinabove
provided. No dividends which have been declared will be remitted to any Person
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock under Section 3.03 until such
Person surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing Company Common
Stock, at which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without
interest.

            (c) Appropriate transmittal materials in a form satisfactory to
Parent and Company shall be mailed as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time
who did not previously submit a properly completed Election Form. Parent shall
not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company

                                     - 15 -
<Page>

Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such
holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of
Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 3.04, or, in
default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or
a bond as may be required by Parent. If any certificates evidencing shares of
Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of
assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

            (d) Any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 3.04(a) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one year after the
Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any stockholders of Company who have
not theretofore complied with Section 3.04(c) shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company
Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to
the date on which such shares of Parent Common Stock or cash would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the
unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any
other applicable law, become the property of Parent (and to the extent not in
its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of
stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to
receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Company Affiliate shall not be
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such Company Affiliate may be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
until Parent has received a written agreement from such Person as specified in
Section 7.07.

     3.05. RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDERS; STOCK TRANSFERS. At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company other than to receive the consideration provided
under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of

                                     - 16 -
<Page>

shares of Company Stock.

     3.06. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who
otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount
determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled by the Average Closing Price. No such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

     3.07. DISSENTING SHARES. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock the
holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock or cash hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any such written demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock and of
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the
DGCL. If any holder of dissenting shares shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (which shares are referred to
as "UNPERFECTED DISSENTING SHARES") at or prior to the Effective Time and shall
have delivered a properly completed Election Form to the Exchange Agent by the
Election Deadline, the Unperfected Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall
be converted into a right to receive Company Common Stock and/or cash in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement; and if any such
holder of Unperfected Dissenting Shares shall not have delivered a properly
completed Election Form to the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the
Unperfected Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be designated
No-Election Shares. If any holder of dissenting shares shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
after the Effective Time, the Unperfected Dissenting Shares held by such holder
shall be converted on a share by share basis into either the right to receive
Parent Common Stock and/or cash in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement as Parent or the Exchange Agent shall determine. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation.

     3.08. ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or
a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Per Share Stock Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly. The
provisions of this Agreement assume that there will be no more than 5,365,122
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the exercise of
options or warrants or otherwise, at the Effective Time. If there is any change
in this number as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration will be
appropriately adjusted.

     3.09. WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent is required under the Code or any state, local or
foreign tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all

                                     - 17 -
<Page>

purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

     3.10. COMPANY OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested and exercisable, shall be terminated and each grantee thereof
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share of Company Common Stock that
would otherwise have been issuable upon the exercise thereof, an amount of cash
computed by multiplying (i) the difference between (x) the Per Share Cash
Consideration and (y) the per share exercise price applicable to such Company
Option by (ii) the number of such shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option. The Company agrees to take or cause to be taken all action
necessary to provide for termination of the Company Options and the payment of
the amounts required in connection therewith effective at or before the
Effective Time.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

<Page>

there are no facts which could reasonably give rise to such litigation, claim or
other proceeding.

     5.10. REGULATORY MATTERS.

            (a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of any
of their respective properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree,
agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a
commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter
from, any federal or state governmental agency or authority charged with the
supervision or regulation of financial institutions or issuers of securities or
engaged in the insurance of deposits or the supervision or regulation of it
(collectively, the "COMPANY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES"). The Company and its
Subsidiaries have paid all assessments made or imposed by any Company Regulatory
Authority.

            (b) Neither the Company nor any its Subsidiaries has been advised
by, or has any knowledge of facts which could give rise to an advisory notice

understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.

     5.11. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries:

in full force and effect and, to the Company's knowledge, no suspension or
cancellation of any of them is threatened; and

            (c) has received, since March 31, 2000, no notification or
communication from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Authority enforces or (B)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization (nor, to the Company's knowledge, do any grounds for any of the
foregoing exist).

     5.12. MATERIAL CONTRACTS; DEFAULTS. Except for documents listed as exhibits
to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2002,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or
subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) (i) that is a "MATERIAL CONTRACT" within the meaning
of Item 601(b)(10) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, (ii) that materially restricts
the conduct of business by the Company or by any of its Subsidiaries,

                                     - 26 -
<Page>

or (iii) that cannot be terminated without penalty on notice of 30 days or less.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material default under any
contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other
instrument to which it is a party, by which its respective assets, business, or
operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its respective assets,
business, or operations receives benefits, and there has not occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute
such a default. No power of attorney or similar authorization given directly or
indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently outstanding.

     5.13. NO BROKERS. No action has been taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against the Company or its
Subsidiaries for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, excluding a
Previously Disclosed fee to be paid to Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P.

     5.14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

            (a) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements covering current or former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "EMPLOYEES") and current or former directors of the Company
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase,
stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the "BENEFITS
PLANS"), are Previously Disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. True and complete
copies of all Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments
and insurance contracts forming a part of any Benefit Plans and all amendments
thereto have been provided or made available to Parent.

            (b) All Benefits Plans are in substantial compliance with ERISA.
Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("PENSION PLAN") and which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination
letter or the loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. There is no material pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
threatened litigation relating to the Benefits Plans. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit
Plan or Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction
expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

            (c) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any
Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the financial
statements of the Company included in the Company's SEC Documents.

            (d) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, or any entity
which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001(a)(15) or
Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") has incurred any liability under
Title IV of ERISA which will not have been paid in full prior to the Closing.
There has been no "accumulated funding deficiency"

                                     - 27 -
<Page>

(whether or not waived) with respect to any Pension Plan subject to Code Section
412 or ERISA Section 302. With respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, there has been no (nor will be any as a result of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement) (i) "reportable event," within the meaning of
ERISA Section 4043, or the regulations thereunder (for which notice the notice
requirement is not waived under 29 C.F.R. Part 2615) with respect to the
Company, and (ii) no event or condition which presents a material risk of plan
termination or any other event that may cause the Company, the Company Bank or
any ERISA Affiliate to incur liability or have a lien imposed on its assets
under Title IV of ERISA. No Pension Plan maintained by the Company, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate and subject to Title IV of ERISA has any
"unfunded benefit liabilities" for which the Company would be liable, within the
meaning of ERISA Section 4001(a)(18), as of the Closing Date, for which the
Company would be liable, and, without any additional contributions being made to
such Plan, the assets of such Plan are sufficient to satisfy all obligations of
the Plan if the Plan were to be terminated as of the Effective Time for which
the Company would be liable. Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries,
or any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a Multiemployer Plan.

            (e) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims by or on behalf of any Benefit Plans, or by or on behalf of
any individual participants or beneficiaries of any Benefit Plans, alleging any
breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Company or any of its officers,
directors or employees under ERISA or any other applicable regulations, or
claiming benefit payments for which the Company may be liable (other than those
made in the ordinary operation of such plans), nor is there, to the knowledge of
the Company, any basis for such claim. The Benefit Plans are not the subject of
any pending (or to the knowledge of the Company, any threatened) investigation
or audit by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

            (f) With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) (a "Welfare Plan")
and except as Previously Disclosed, (i) each Welfare Plan for which
contributions are claimed by the Company as deductions under any provision of
the Code is in material compliance with all applicable requirements pertaining
to such deduction, (ii) with respect to any welfare benefit fund (within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code) related to a Welfare Plan, there is no
disqualified benefit (within the meaning of Section 4976(b) of the Code) that
would result in the imposition of a tax under Section 4976(a) of the Code, (iii)
any Benefit Plan that is a group health plan (within the meaning of Section
4980B(g)(2) of the Code) complies, and in each and every case has complied, with
all of the applicable material requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, ERISA,
Title XXII of the Public Health Service Act and the Social Security Act, and
(iv) all Welfare Plans may be amended or terminated at any time on or after the
Closing Date.

            (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan, other
than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws
of any state or locality. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may amend or
terminate any such Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability
thereunder.

            (h) None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of
this Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (A) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in

                                     - 28 -
<Page>

severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment that would
be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are
defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is
reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in
the future.

     5.15. LABOR MATTERS. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it
has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor
is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened, nor is the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any activity involving its employees
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other
organizational activity.

     5.16. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

            (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws;

            (b) to the Company's knowledge, no real property (including
buildings or other structures) currently or formerly owned or operated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any property in which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has held a security interest, Lien or a fiduciary or
management role ("COMPANY LOAN PROPERTY"), has been contaminated with, or has
had any release of, any Hazardous Substance except in compliance with
Environmental Laws;

            (c) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated
in the management regarding Hazardous Substances of, any Company Loan Property
which has been contaminated with, or has had any release of, any Hazardous
Substance except in compliance with Environmental Laws;

            (d) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any third

of, or liability under, any Environmental Law;

any order, decree, injunction or other agreement with any Governmental Authority
or any third party relating to any Environmental Law;

                                     - 29 -

            (g) to the Company's knowledge, there are no circumstances or
conditions (including the presence of asbestos, underground storage tanks, lead
products, polychlorinated biphenyls, prior manufacturing operations,
dry-cleaning, or automotive services) involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any currently or formerly owned or operated property, or any
Company Loan Property, that could reasonably be expected to result in any
claims, liability or investigations against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, result in any restrictions on the ownership, use, or transfer of
any property pursuant to any Environmental Law, or adversely affect the value of
any Company Loan Property; and

            (h) the Company has delivered or made available to Parent copies of
all environmental reports, studies, sampling data, correspondence, filings and
other environmental information in its possession or reasonably available to it
relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and any currently or formerly owned or
operated property or any Company Loan Property.

local law, regulation, order, decree, permit, authorization, opinion or agency
requirement relating to: (A) the protection or restoration of the environment,
health, safety, or natural resources, (B) the handling, use, presence, disposal,

each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that it was
required to file under applicable laws and regulations. All such Tax Returns
were correct and complete in all material respects and have been prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All Taxes due
and owing by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on

            (d) The Company has Previously Disclosed the United States federal,
state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to any of the

Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its
federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a
substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code
Section 6662. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an Affiliated Group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of

(other than any of the Company and its Subsidiaries) under Reg. Section 1.1502-6

            (g) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) did
not, as of the end of the most recent period covered by the Company's SEC
Documents filed on or prior to the date hereof, exceed the reserve for Tax

timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
financial statements included in the Company's SEC Documents filed on or prior

extraordinary gains or

                                     - 31 -
<Page>

losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business
consistent with past custom and practice.

            (h) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable
income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date
as a result of any: (A) change in method of accounting for a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (B) "closing agreement" as described in
Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (C)
intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Code Section 1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision
of state, local or foreign income Tax law); (D) installment sale or open

amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.

     5.18. RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or has agreed to enter into an exchange traded or
over-the-counter equity, interest rate, foreign exchange or other swap, forward,
future, option, cap, floor or collar or any other contract that is not included
on the balance sheet and is a derivatives contract (including various
combinations thereof) (each, a "DERIVATIVES CONTRACT") or owns securities that
(i) are referred to generically as "structured notes," "high risk mortgage
derivatives," "capped floating rate notes" or "capped floating rate mortgage
derivatives" or (ii) are likely to have changes in value as a result of interest
or exchange rate changes that significantly exceed normal changes in value
attributable to interest or exchange rate changes, except for those Derivatives
Contracts and other instruments legally purchased or entered into in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with safe and sound banking practices
and regulatory guidance. All of such Derivatives Contracts or other instruments,
are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as enforcement
may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law
or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally), and are in full force and effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and, to the Company's knowledge, there are no breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder which would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

     5.19. LOANS; NONPERFORMING AND CLASSIFIED ASSETS.

            (a) Each loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement, including
without limitation portions of outstanding lines of credit and loan commitments
(collectively, "LOANS"), on the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, was made and has been serviced in all material respects in
accordance with customary lending standards in the ordinary course of business,
is evidenced in all material respects by appropriate and sufficient
documentation and, to the knowledge of the Company, constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights or by general
equity principles.

            (b) The Company has Previously Disclosed as to the Company and each

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to stockholders
and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of the Company
and Parent further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the
Effective Date of any information furnished by such party that would cause any
of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading,
to promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to
correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement.

            (c) Parent agrees to advise the Company, promptly after Parent
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any
stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Parent
is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any
request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement
or for additional information.

     7.04. REGULATORY FILINGS.

            (a) Each of Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary to consummate the Transactions and any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement; and any initial filings with
Governmental Authorities (other than the Proxy Statement) shall be made by
Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof. Each of
Parent and the Company shall have a reasonable time to review such filings in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to all written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such parties agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it
shall consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, and each party
shall keep the other parties apprised of the status of material matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                     - 42 -
<Page>

            (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
third party or Governmental Authority.

     7.05. PRESS RELEASES. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to the Transactions or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public
statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the
rules or regulations of Nasdaq or other regulatory authority. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make
appropriate management available at presentations related to the Transactions as
reasonably requested by the other party.

     7.06. ACCESS; INFORMATION.

            (a) The Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Parent
and Parent's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties and
personnel and to such other information as Parent may reasonably request and,
during such period, it shall furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Representatives of the Company's senior management will meet
periodically with representatives of Parent to coordinate post-closing
integration planning, including working toward conforming the Company's and
Parent's asset/liability management policies and practices.

            (b) Parent agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford the
Company and its authorized representatives such access to Parent's personnel as
the Company may reasonably request and to such information relating to Parent as
the Company may reasonably request.

            (c) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
7.06 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject
to the requirements of law, each party shall keep confidential, and shall cause
its representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained
pursuant to this Section 7.06 (as well as any other information obtained prior
to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement)
unless such information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes
available to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound
by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written
approval of the party to which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes
readily ascertainable from publicly available sources. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated or the transactions contemplated by this

                                     - 43 -
<Page>

Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each party shall promptly
cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof containing information and
data as to another party hereto to be returned to the party which furnished the
same. No investigation by any party of the business and affairs of any other
party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to any party's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     7.07. AFFILIATES. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
identify those Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company
within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act
(the "COMPANY AFFILIATES") and to cause each Person so identified to deliver to
Parent as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, a written agreement ("AFFILIATE AGREEMENT") to comply with the
requirements of Rule 145 under the Securities Act in connection with the sale or
other transfer of Parent Common Stock received in the Merger, which agreement
shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

     7.08. ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers shall, and that it shall
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and each such
Subsidiary's directors, employees, agents and representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
officers shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and each such Subsidiary's directors employees, agents and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or
the Company Board from (A) complying with its disclosure obligations under
federal or state law; (B) providing information in response to a request
therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if the Company Board receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement no less favorable to it than
the Confidentiality Agreement entered into on November 26, 2002 by Parent and
the Company; (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or (D)
recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the Company, if
and only to the extent that, (i) in each such case referred to in clause (B),
(C) or (D) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that such action is reasonably likely to be required
in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties
under applicable law and (ii) in the case referred to in clause (D) above, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person making the proposal and, if consummated, is
reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger. The Company agrees
that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it will
notify Parent immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are

                                     - 44 -
<Page>

sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives. The
Company will promptly (within one business day) advise Parent following receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of
any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis. The Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to enforce (and will not waive any provisions of)
any confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by it or on its behalf by
Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. or otherwise relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence,
the Company may waive standstill provisions of such an agreement with respect to
a particular Acquisition Proposal if (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action would be
required in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary
duties under applicable law and (ii) the Company Board also determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger.

     7.09. CERTAIN POLICIES. Prior to the Effective Date, each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of
the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan,
OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be
applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent; provided, however,
that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of
all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII; and further provided that in
any event, no accrual or reserve made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 7.09 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be
considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to
satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be
deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or
information and shall not be construed as concurrence of the Company or its
management with any such adjustments.

     7.10. NASDAQ LISTING. Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger.

     7.11. INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer and employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
determined as of the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
the Company or

                                     - 45 -
<Page>

any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including without limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to
the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the
Company Certificate and Company Bylaws.

            (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 7.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements
therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations; provided, however, that in the
event of such determination, the Indemnified Party may seek indemnification from
Parent Bank, which shall assume the Indemnifying Party's obligation under this
Section 7.11 to the extent that any payment by Parent Bank is not prohibited by
applicable laws or regulations.

            (c) Prior the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the Company's
directors and officers in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company which
shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for five years following
the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other
terms no materially less favorable on the whole to the insured Persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company, provided that in no event shall Parent be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT"), and further provided
that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 7.11(c) as a result of the preceding provision, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time by such directors and officers in their capacities as such.

                                     - 46 -
<Page>

            (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.11.

     7.12. BENEFIT PLANS.

            (a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Parent of general applicability (the "PARENT
BENEFITS PLANS") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the Parent Benefits Plans may occur at different
times with respect to different plans.) Parent shall cause each Parent Benefits
Plan (other than Parent's employee stock ownership plan) in which employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits
and for all other purposes (but not for accrual of benefits) under the Parent
Benefit Plans, the service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by
the Company. Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be given credit
for past service with the Company for purposes of Parent's vacation policy.
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be treated as newly hired
employees for purposes of Parent's employee stock ownership plan.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Parent shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to
whether or when to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and
programs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that
Company shall terminate the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan as of the
Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. To the extent amounts
are distributable under Benefit Plans and constitute "eligible rollover
distributions" (as defined in Section 402(f)(2)(A) of the Code) said amounts may
be rolled over to any tax-qualified Parent Benefit Plan that accepts rollover
distributions or to any eligible individual retirement account.

            (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or in
the Payments Agreements, Parent shall honor, and the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit
obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of the
Company existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, severance,
deferred compensation or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of
the Company, but only to the extent that such obligations are Previously
Disclosed in Sections 4.01(b)(5) and 5.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a
"change-in-control" of the Company for purposes of any employee benefit plans,
agreements and arrangements of the Company.

            (d) If employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Parent, Parent
shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to
the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or
dental plans of Parent and (ii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such

                                     - 47 -
<Page>

employee on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Plan prior to
the Effective Time, and (iii) provide full credit under such plans for any
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation.

            (e) Parent will endeavor to retain as many of Company's officers and
employees as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or a
Parent Subsidiary shall have no obligation to continue the employment of any
employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary and nothing contained herein
shall give any such Person the right to continued employment with Parent or a
Parent Subsidiary after the Effective Time. An employee of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary (other than an employee who is party to an employment
agreement, a severance agreement or a special termination agreement) whose
employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause following the
Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance
with, and to the extent provided in, the Company's Employee Severance
Compensation Plan Previously Disclosed to Parent.

     7.13. BANK MERGER. Parent and the Company agree to take all action
necessary and appropriate, including causing the entering into of an appropriate
merger agreement (the "BANK MERGER AGREEMENT"), to cause the Company Bank to
merge, either directly or indirectly, by use of one or more interim
corporations, with and into the Parent Bank (the "BANK MERGER") in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement
and as soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger.

     7.14. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (i) if it had been known as of the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been included in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together
with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it, or (iii) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

     7.15. PAYMENTS AND RELATED AGREEMENTS. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement by the Company, Merger Sub and Parent, (i) Parent, the Company
and the Company Bank have entered into a Payments Agreement with each of John F.
Murphy, Denise M. Renaghan and Michael O. Gilles in a form that has been
Previously Disclosed (the "PAYMENTS AGREEMENTS"), and (ii) a Consulting and
Non-Competition Agreement with each of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Renaghan in a form
that has been Previously Disclosed (the "CONSULTING AGREEMENTS").

     7.16. SECTION 16 MATTERS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Company agrees to promptly furnish Parent with all requisite information
necessary for Parent to take the actions contemplated by this Section 7.16.

force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have
expired and no such approval shall contain any conditions, restrictions or

Transactions to such a degree that Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement had such conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the
date hereof.

            (c) NO INJUNCTION. No Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any

                                     - 49 -
<Page>

Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that for
purposes of this Section 8.02(a), such representations and warranties shall be
deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or failures of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the

            (e) CONSENTS UNDER AGREEMENTS. The consent, approval or waiver of
each Person (other than regulatory approvals contemplated in Section 8.01(b))
whose consent or approval shall be required in order to permit the succession by
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the Merger to any obligation, right or
interest of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries under any loan or
credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, license or other agreement
or instrument shall have been obtained, except for such consents the failure of
which to be obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent after giving effect to the consummation of the
Transactions, and none of such permits, consents, waivers, clearances, approvals
and authorizations shall contain any term or condition which would materially
impair the value of the Company to Parent.

            (f) TERMINATION OF CERTAIN EXISTING EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. All
contracts, plans, and arrangements, whether written or oral, pursuant to which
payments and other benefits would otherwise be due to John F. Murphy, Denise M.
Renaghan and Michael O. Gilles shall each have been terminated without cost to
Company, Company Bank or any party to this Agreement, except for such payments
as are provided for under and as otherwise set forth in the Payments Agreements.

            (g) NO PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. Neither Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries shall have taken any action or made any payments that would result,
either individually or in the aggregate, in any violation of the requirements
set forth in Section 4.01(b)(9).

            (h) OTHER ACTIONS. The Company shall have furnished Parent and
Merger Sub with such certificates of its officers or others and such other
documents to evidence fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01
and 8.03 as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request.

                                   ARTICLE IX.
                                   TERMINATION

     9.01. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any requisite approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated in this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company:

            (a) MUTUAL CONSENT. By mutual consent of Parent and the Company, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board.

                                     - 51 -
<Page>

            (b) DELAY. By either Parent or the Company (if its Board of
Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire
Board) if (i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before December
31, 2003 or such later date as the parties may have agreed upon in writing (the
"EXPIRATION DATE"), except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to
be consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of
(i) the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 9.01(b) or (ii) any
of the Shareholders (if the Company is the party seeking to terminate), which
action or inaction is in violation of its obligations under this Agreement or,
in the case of the Shareholders, his, her or its obligations under the relevant
Voting Agreement.

            (c) NO APPROVAL. By the Company or Parent, if its Board of Directors
so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the
event the approval of any Governmental Authority required for consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have
been denied by final nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority or an
application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a
Governmental Authority.

            (d) BREACH. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Parent or
the Company (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of
its entire Board, in the event of: (i) a material breach by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, of any representation or warranty contained herein,
which breach would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.02(a) or 8.03(a), as the
case may be, and which cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the
giving of written notice to the breaching party or parties of such breach; or
(ii) a material breach by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, of any of
the covenants or agreements contained herein, which breach cannot be or has not
been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching
party or parties of such breach.

            (e) NO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. By either Parent or the Company
(provided, that the terminating party shall not be in material breach of any of
its obligations under Section 7.02) if any approval of the stockholders of the
Company required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained
by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of
the Company's stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or, if
such meeting of stockholders shall not have been held or shall have been
canceled prior to the Expiration Date.

            (f) FAILURE TO RECOMMEND. By Parent if, at any time prior to the
Company Meeting, (i) the Company shall have materially breached Section 7.08 or
(ii) the Company Board shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to
in Section 7.02, withdrawn such recommendation or modified or changed such
recommendation in a manner adverse in any respect to the interests of Parent, or
(iii) the Company shall have materially breached its obligations to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting in accordance with Section 7.02.

            (g) CERTAIN TENDER OFFERS. By Parent, if a Tender Offer is commenced
(as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), other than by
Parent or a Subsidiary thereof, and the Company Board recommends that the
stockholders of the Company tender their

                                     - 52 -
<Page>

shares in such Tender Offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such
stockholders reject such Tender Offer within the 10 business day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

            (h) POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT. By the Company, if the Company Board so
determines by the vote of a majority of all of its members, by giving written
notice to Parent not later than the end of the second Business Day next
following the Determination Date, in the event that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

                 (i) the Average Closing Price shall be less than 90% of the
            Signing Date Average Closing Price; and

                 (ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing
            Price by the Signing Date Average Closing Price is less than (B) the
            number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial
            Index Price and then multiplying the quotient in this clause (ii)(B)
            by 0.80.

     If the Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
Section 9.01(h), it shall give written notice to Parent. During the
five-business-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Parent may,
at its option (the "Fill Option"), offer to adjust the Per Share Stock
Consideration to a level determined by multiplying the original Per Share Stock
Consideration by a quotient determined by dividing $19.33 by the Average Closing
Price. If Parent makes an election contemplated by the preceding sentence within
such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such
election and the revised Per Share Stock Consideration, whereupon no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.01(h) and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Per Share Stock
Consideration shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement
to "PER SHARE STOCK CONSIDERATION" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Per Share Stock Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this Section 9.01(h).

     If Parent or any company belonging to the Index Group declares or effects a
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of the Agreement and
the valuation date, the prices for the common stock of such company will be
appropriately adjusted.

     9.02. EFFECT OF TERMINATION; EXPENSES.

            (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void (except as set forth in
Section 10.01), and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto,
except (i) each party shall remain liable in any action at law or otherwise for
any liabilities or damages arising out of its gross negligence or willful breach
of any provision of this Agreement, and (ii) as otherwise provided in this
Section 9.02.

            (b) If this Agreement is terminated as a result of any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement which is caused by the
gross negligence or willful or intentional breach of a party hereto, such party
shall be liable to the other party for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers,
accountants and investment bankers, incurred by such other party in connection
with the

                                     - 53 -
<Page>

entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts
contemplated hereunder ("EXPENSES"). The payment of Expenses is not an exclusive
remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the
parties hereto (whether at law or in equity) arising out of the gross negligence
of a party or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement or under this
Agreement.

     9.03. COMPANY SPECIAL PAYMENT. As a condition of Parent's willingness, and
in order to induce Parent, to enter into this Agreement and to reimburse Parent
for incurring the damages, costs and expenses related to entering into this
Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company will pay to Parent the sum of $6,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 9.03(d), the "COMPANY SPECIAL PAYMENT"), if and only if a
Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred before the Special
Payment Termination Date (as hereinafter defined) determined in accordance with
Section 9.03(c).

            (a) "PAYMENT EVENT" shall mean any of the following events:

                 (i) Without Parent's prior written consent, the Company shall
            have entered into an agreement to effect, or shall have consummated,
            a Change in Control Transaction; or

                 (ii) This Agreement shall have been terminated by either Parent
            or the Company as a result of the Company's willful or intentional
            breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
            contained in this Agreement.

            (b) A "TIME EXTENSION EVENT" means any of the following events:

                 (i) any person (other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary)
            shall have commenced (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 under
            the Exchange Act), or shall have filed a registration statement
            under the Securities Act with respect to, a Tender Offer; or

                 (ii) Any person (other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary)
            shall have acquired beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in
            Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of or has the
            contractual right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group"
            (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)
            shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the
            contractual right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 25% or more of
            the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; or

                 (iii) following the public announcement of an Acquisition
            Proposal, the holders of Company Common Stock shall not have
            approved this Agreement at the meeting of such stockholders held for
            the purpose of voting on this Agreement; or

                 (iv) following the occurrence of an Acquisition Proposal:

                       (A) the meeting of Company stockholders held for the
                 purpose of voting on this Agreement shall not have been held or
                 shall have been

                                     - 54 -
<Page>

                 canceled prior to termination of this Agreement,

                       (B) the Company's Board of Directors shall have withdrawn
                 or modified in a manner adverse to Parent the recommendation of
                 the Company's Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement
                 and the Merger, or

                       (C) The Company shall have willfully or intentionally
                 breached any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
                 contained in this Agreement and such breach would entitle
                 Parent to terminate this Agreement under Section 9.01(d) hereof
                 (without regard to the cure period provided for therein unless
                 such cure is promptly effected without jeopardizing
                 consummation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this
                 Agreement).

            (c) DURATION OF PARENT'S RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO COMPANY SPECIAL
PAYMENT. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions
of this Section 9.03 shall remain in effect and shall be enforceable by Parent
or any successor in interest until the "SPECIAL PAYMENT TERMINATION DATE", which
shall be the earliest to occur of:

                 (i) The Effective Time of the Merger,

                 (ii) The date that is 12 months after termination or expiration
            of this Agreement following the occurrence of a Time Extension
            Event;

                 (iii) The date on which the Agreement is terminated in
            accordance with its terms, BUT ONLY IF such termination takes place
            PRIOR to the occurrence of a Payment Event or a Time Extension
            Event.

            (d) EXCLUSIVITY OF REMEDY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, if the Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent
or to Parent Bank the Company Special Payment, neither the Company nor Company
Bank will have any further obligations or liabilities to Parent or Parent Bank
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            (e) ADJUSTMENT TO AMOUNT OF COMPANY SPECIAL PAYMENT. The amount of
the Company Special Payment shall be reduced by the amount of any Expenses paid
by the Company to Parent pursuant to Section 9.02(b).

            (f) EFFECT ON STANDSTILL ARRANGEMENTS. In the event the Company pays
to Parent the Company Special Payment, any standstill provisions contained in
the Confidentiality Agreements referred to in Section 7.08 shall terminate.

            (g) PAYMENT REQUIRED. Any payment required under this Section 9.03
will be (i) payable by the Company to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent) within five business days

and in order to induce the Company to, enter into this Agreement, and to
reimburse the Company for incurring the damages, costs and expenses related to
entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent hereby agrees to pay to the Company a cash payment in the
amount of $6,000,000 (the "PARENT SPECIAL PAYMENT") if and only if the Company
has terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(d) and the breach
of the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under Section 9.01(d) was
caused by the willful conduct or gross negligence of Parent. Under such
circumstances Parent will also pay to the Company Expenses as provided in
Section 9.02(b).

            (b) PAYMENTS REQUIRED. Any payment required to be made under this
Section 9.04 shall be paid by Parent to the Company by wire transfer of

this Agreement.

Effective Time (other than Sections 7.06(c), 9.03, 9.04, and, excepting Section

     10.07. ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement,
the Bank Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Payments Agreements, and
the Consulting Agreements represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements,
the Payments Agreements, the Consulting Agreements supersede any and all other
oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except for the Indemnified Parties'
right to enforce Parent's obligation under Section 7.11, which are expressly
intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other
than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

     10.08. SEVERABILITY. Except to the extent that application of this Section
10.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, any term or
provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity
or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

     10.09. ENFORCEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

     10.10. INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." References to sections include
subsections which are part of the related sections (e.g. a section numbered
"Section 5.5(a)" would be part of "Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5"
would also refer to material contained in the subsection described as "Section
5.5(a)").

     10.11. ASSIGNMENT. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of
the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

     10.12. ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
acquisition of the Company set forth

                                     - 58 -
<Page>

herein, subject to the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that (i) the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock is not thereby
changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, (ii) such
modification will not adversely affect the tax treatment of the Company's
stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration and (iii) such
modification will not materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required
approvals of Governmental Authorities.

used herein and not defined herein have the respective meanings set forth in the

Company with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "MERGER");

     WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder beneficially owns (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and
has voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock, par value
$.01 per share (the "COMMON STOCK"), of the Company set forth opposite the
Stockholder's name on Appendix I attached hereto (such shares, together with any
other shares of Common Stock which the Stockholder acquires beneficial ownership
in any capacity after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, the "SHARES"); and

     WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the
Merger Agreement, Parent has required that each Stockholder enter into this
Agreement with respect to such Shares; and

     WHEREAS, the Stockholder intends this Agreement to be a voting agreement
authorized under Section 218(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a condition to, Buyer's
entering into the Merger Agreement, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by Buyer in connection therewith, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

     1. AGREEMENT TO VOTE. While this Agreement is in effect, Stockholder agrees
to vote or cause to be voted all Shares that Stockholder shall be entitled to so

and held following the date hereof (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the "COMPANY MEETING") or at any other meeting of the Company's
shareholders, and in connection with every action or approval by written consent
of the Company, (a) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (b) against
any Acquisition Proposal.

     2. AGREEMENT TO RETAIN SHARES. While this Agreement is in effect, other

of, any Shares beneficially owned by Stockholder, except (a) transfers by will
or by operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee,
(b) transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing

on the date hereof with respect the Shares held by such stockholder, (e) shares
withheld by the Company in connection with the vesting of restricted stock or
the exercise of stock options to satisfy tax withholding obligations, (f)
transfers in connection with the exercise of stock options for the purpose of
payment of the exercise price, including cashless exercises, using shares
currently held to pay the exercise price, disposing of shares acquired upon the
exercise of stock options and margining stock currently held, and (g) as Buyer
may otherwise agree in its sole discretion. The provisions of Paragraph 2(f)
shall apply only to John F. Murphy, Denise M. Renaghan and Michael O. Gilles.

     3. LEGEND. The Company shall cause its transfer agent to note on its
records for the Company (in whatever form maintained) that such Shares are
subject to the restrictions on voting and transfer set forth herein, and at
Buyer's request shall have any existing certificates representing Shares subject

     unqualified right to enter into and perform the terms of this Agreement.
     This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
     Stockholder and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement with
     respect to Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with
     its terms, except to the extent enforcement may be limited by general
     principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity
     and by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws affecting
     creditors' rights and remedies generally.

          (b) Stockholder (i) beneficially owns the number of Shares indicated
     opposite Stockholder's name on Appendix I, hereto, free and clear of any
     liens, claims, charges or other encumbrances of any kind whatsoever, except

     to such Shares with no limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such
     rights and (ii) does not beneficially own any shares of capital stock

     of the Company other than such Shares as to which Stockholder does not have
     voting power except as disclosed on Appendix I.

          (c) There are no proxies, voting trusts or understandings to or by
     which Stockholder is a party or bound or that expressly requires that any
     of the Shares be voted in a specific manner other than as provided in this
     Agreement or that provides for any right on the part of any other person
     other than Stockholder to vote such Shares.

inure to the benefit of, the respective parties and their permitted successors,
assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, as
the case may be.

     7. WAIVERS. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by Buyer to
any Stockholder shall be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies of
Buyer with respect to any other Stockholder of the Company who has executed a
copy of this Agreement with respect to Shares held by Stockholder or with
respect to any subsequent breach of the Stockholder or any other Stockholder of
the Company.

     8. AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS. This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a

counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.
