occurrence of, the Effective Time, and subject to such individuals ability
and willingness to serve. The roles and responsibilities of such officers
shall be as specified on Exhibit B to this Agreement. In the event that the

Executive Officer of Duke as of the Effective Time, Progress and Duke shall
confer and mutually designate a President and Chief Executive Officer of Duke,

Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws of Duke as in
effect as of the Effective Time. In the event that the Duke CEO is unwilling

accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Amended and Restated By-laws of Duke as in effect as of the Effective Time.

(ii) The material terms of the Progress CEOs employment with Duke as the

contributions and community support in their respective service areas serves a
number of their important corporate goals. During the two-year period
immediately following the Effective Time, Duke and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole intend to continue to provide charitable contributions and
community support within the service areas of the parties and each of their
respective subsidiaries in each service area at levels substantially
comparable to the levels of charitable contributions and community support

designees of Progress.

(b) _Conversion of Progress Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.02(e) and
2.02(k), each issued and outstanding share of Progress Common Stock (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) shall be
converted into the right to receive 2.6125 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Duke Common Stock (such aggregate amount,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Progress Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Progress Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.01(b) (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares

 



-4-   of Duke Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of certificates in
accordance with Section 2.02, without interest, and the right to receive
dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.02.

(c)  _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

Section 2.02  _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Duke shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be mutually agreed by Duke
and Progress (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which agreement shall provide that
Duke shall deposit with the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Progress Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Duke Common Stock representing the
Merger Consideration (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made
by Duke if uncertificated shares of Duke Common Stock will be issued).
Following the Effective Time, Duke shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) (such shares of Duke Common Stock to
be deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
following the Effective Time, Duke shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Progress Common Stock
(the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Duke Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(b), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Duke and Progress may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing whole shares of Duke Common Stock (or appropriate
alternative arrangements shall be made by Duke if uncertificated shares of
Duke Common Stock will be issued), cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number
of whole shares of Duke Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested), 

 



-5-   that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Duke Common Stock
in accordance with Section 2.02(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Progress
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Progress, the
proper number of shares of Duke Common Stock may be issued to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Duke Common Stock
to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Duke that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, which the holder
thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Duke Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration or any cash payable to holders
of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Duke Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Duke Common Stock issuable hereunder in respect
thereof and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Duke to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, (i) without
interest, the number of whole shares of Duke Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Duke Common Stock and the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Duke Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Duke Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Progress Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All shares of Duke Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Progress Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificates, subject, however, to Progresss obligation to pay any dividends
or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by Progress on such shares of Progress
Common Stock that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. As of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Progress shall be closed, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Progress
of the shares of Progress Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to Progress, Duke or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise
required by law.

 



-6-  (e) _No Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Duke Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution of Duke shall relate to such fractional share
interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Duke but, in lieu
thereof, each holder of such Certificate will be entitled to a cash payment
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.02(e).

 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of whole shares of Duke
Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Duke pursuant to Section
2.02(a) representing the Merger Consideration over (B) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Duke Common Stock to be distributed to former holders of
Progress Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (such excess being herein
called the " _Excess Shares_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall, on behalf of former shareholders of Progress, sell the Excess
Shares at then-prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("
_NYSE_ "), all in the manner provided in Section 2.02(e)(iii). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of
issuing fractional shares of Duke Common Stock was not separately bargained
for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes
of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Duke that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Duke Common Stock.

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed
in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use
reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly
following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agents sole judgment, is
practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in
light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of Certificates formerly
representing Progress Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds in trust for holders of Progress Common Stock (the " _Common Shares
Trust_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall pay all commissions, transfer
taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of
the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the
Common Shares Trust to which each former holder of Progress Common Stock is
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds
composing the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the fractional share interest to which such former holder of
Progress Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account
all shares of Progress Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all former holders of Progress Common Stock would otherwise
be entitled.

(iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Certificates formerly representing Progress
Common Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange
Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Certificates
formerly representing Progress Common Stock, without interest, subject to and
in accordance with the terms of Section 2.02(c).

 



-7-  (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Duke, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Duke for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration, any dividends or distributions with respect to Duke Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Duke Common Stock.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Duke, Progress, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person in respect of any
shares of Duke Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Duke Common Stock or any
cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration, any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate or any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate formerly
representing Progress Common Stock pursuant to this Article II, would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority),
any such Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or such cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of Duke, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.

(h)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Duke, on a daily basis, provided
that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders
of Progress Common Stock pursuant to the other provisions of this Article II.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Duke.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Duke and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any person who was a holder of Progress Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Duke and the Exchange Agent may be required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Duke or the Exchange
Agent and duly paid over to the applicable taxing authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Duke, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Duke may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of Duke Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.

 



-8-  (k) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Progress changes the
number of shares of Progress Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Progress Common Stock, or Duke
changes the number of shares of Duke Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Duke Common Stock, issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time, in each case as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, subdivision, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.02(k) shall be deemed
to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is
not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon Dukes implementation
of the reverse stock split as described in Section 5.01(c), the Exchange
Ratio will be reduced by multiplying the then-current Exchange Ratio by a
ratio, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Duke Common Stock
outstanding immediately following such reverse stock split, and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Duke Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such reverse stock split.

(l)  _Uncertificated Shares_. In the case of outstanding shares of Progress
Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make
such adjustments to this Section 2.02 as are necessary or appropriate to
implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.02 has with respect
to shares of Progress Common Stock that are represented by Certificates.

(c) _Authority_. Progress has full corporate power and authority to enter

Progress for their approval, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of

and validly executed and delivered by Progress and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Duke and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Progress enforceable
against Progress in accordance with its terms, except that such enforcement
may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating
to creditors rights generally and to general equitable principles.

a Progress Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach (other than in
immaterial respects) of this Section 4.03(a) is, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Progress Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 4.03(b)), and
subject to providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action
to

 



-50-   Duke and compliance with Section 4.03(c), Progress may (x) furnish
information with respect to and provide access to the properties, books and
records of Progress and its subsidiaries to the person making such proposal
(and its representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to Progress with respect to confidentiality
than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") dated July 29, 2010, between Duke and Progress ( _provided_ ,
that such confidentiality agreement shall not in any way restrict Progress
from complying with its disclosure obligations under this Agreement,
including with respect to such proposal) and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal. Progress, its subsidiaries and their
representatives immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties with
respect to any Progress Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "

from any person relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net
income or the assets (including equity securities) of Progress and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Progress Material Business_ "), (ii) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of
voting securities of Progress or any subsidiary of Progress owning, operating

exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of voting securities of Progress, or (iv) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Progress or any subsidiary of
Progress owning, operating or controlling a Progress Material Business, in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and provided that Progress has otherwise
complied with this Section 4.03(a), nothing in this Section 4.03(a) shall
prohibit Progress or its directors, officers, employees, representatives or
agents from contacting in writing any person who has made a Progress Takeover
Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification
of the terms and conditions thereof to the extent necessary to permit it to
determine whether the Progress Takeover Proposal is, or is reasonably likely
to result in, a Progress Superior Proposal.

(b) Except as contemplated by this Section 4.03, neither the Board of
Directors of Progress nor any committee thereof shall (A) withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Duke, the
approval or recommendation to Progresss shareholders by such Board of
Directors or such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (B) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Progress Takeover
Proposal, or (C) cause Progress to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "
_Progress Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Progress Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: 

(i) in response to a Progress Takeover Proposal that did not result from a
breach (other than in immaterial respects) of Section 4.03(a), during the
Progress Applicable Period, the Board of Directors of Progress may, if it
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of the Board of Directors fiduciary obligations under applicable law, (A)
withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of
this Agreement or the Merger, (B) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, any Progress Superior Proposal, or (C) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(d), but only after (1) in the case of each of
clauses (B) or (C),

 



-51-   such Board of Directors has determined in good faith that such Progress
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Progress Superior Proposal, and (2) in the
case of clause (C), (I) Progress has notified Duke in writing of the
determination that such Progress Takeover Proposal constitutes a Progress
Superior Proposal and (II) at least five business days following receipt by
Duke of such notice, the Board of Directors of Progress has determined that
such Progress Superior Proposal remains a Progress Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any such Progress Takeover
Proposal is thereafter modified by the person making such Progress
Takeover Proposal and the Board of Directors determines pursuant to clause
(C) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d), Progress shall
again comply with clauses (I) and (II) of this paragraph (b)(i) except that
the five business-day period shall be reduced to two business days; and

(ii) in circumstances other than in response to a Progress Takeover Proposal
as provided in Section 4.03(b)(i), during the Progress Applicable Period, the
Board of Directors of Progress may, if it determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary obligations under applicable law, withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation by such Board
of Directors or any committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger, but
only after (1) Progress has notified Duke in writing that the Board of
Directors of Progress is prepared to make the determination set forth in this
clause (ii) setting forth the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, (2) for
a period of five business days following Dukes receipt of the notice set
forth in clause (1) of this sentence (or, if the period from the time of
receipt by Duke of such notice to the Progress Shareholders Meeting shall be
less than five business days, for such lesser period), Progress negotiates
with Duke in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
as would enable the Progress Board of Directors to proceed with its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and (3) at the end of such
five-business day period (or such lesser period, as the case may be,
in accordance with this clause (ii)) the Board of Directors of Progress
maintains its determination described in this clause (ii) (after taking into
account Dukes proposed adjustments, if any, to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby).

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Progress Superior Proposal_ " means any
written Progress Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Progress
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable (taking into account
(i) all financial and strategic considerations, including relevant legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Progress Takeover Proposal and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
deemed relevant by the Board of Directors, (ii) the identity of the third
party making such Progress Takeover Proposal, and (iii) the conditions and
prospects for completion of such Progress Takeover Proposal) to Progresss
shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account all of the terms of any proposal by Duke to
amend or modify the terms of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except that (x) the references to "20%" in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of "Progress Takeover Proposal"
in Section 4.03(a) shall each be deemed to be a reference to "50%", (y)
a "Progress Takeover Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction
involving Progress, and not any of its subsidiaries or Progress Material
Businesses alone, and (z) the references to "or any subsidiary of
Progress owning, operating or controlling a Progress Material Business" in
clauses (ii) and (iv) shall be deemed to be deleted.

 



-52-  (c) In addition to the obligations of Progress set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.03, Progress shall as promptly as practicable
advise Duke, orally and in writing, of any Progress Takeover Proposal or of
any request for information relating to any Progress Takeover Proposal (and in
any case within 48 hours of such request or the receipt of such Progress
Takeover Proposal), the principal terms and conditions of such request or
Progress Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such request
or Progress Takeover Proposal. Progress shall keep Duke informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request or Progress Takeover Proposal.
Contemporaneously with any termination by Progress of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.01(b)(i), Progress shall provide Duke with a written verification
that it has complied with its obligations pursuant to this Section 4.03(c)
(other than noncompliance which is immaterial).

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Progress or its Board
of Directors or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to Progresss shareholders if, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Progress,
after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its or Progresss obligations under applicable law or (ii)
taking actions permitted by Section 4.01(f).

 

Section 4.04 _No Solicitation by Duke_. (a) Except as expressly permitted by
this Section 4.04, Duke shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its directors,
officers or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative retained by it or any of its subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action
designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes a Duke Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any negotiations
or substantive discussions regarding any Duke Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, at any time prior to receipt of the Duke Shareholder
Approval (the " _Duke Applicable Period_ "), the Board of Directors of Duke
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors, that a Duke Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach
(other than in immaterial respects) of this Section 4.04(a) is, or is
reasonably likely to result in, a Duke Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 4.04(b)), and subject to providing prior written notice of
its decision to take such action to Progress and compliance with Section
4.04(c), Duke may (x) furnish information with respect to and provide access
to the properties, books and records of Duke and its subsidiaries to the
person making such proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to Duke with
respect to confidentiality than those set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement ( _provided_ , that such confidentiality agreement shall not in any
way restrict Duke from complying with its disclosure obligations under this
Agreement, including with respect to such proposal) and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal. Duke, its subsidiaries
and their representatives immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties with
respect to any Duke Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Duke Takeover Proposal_ " means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer from
any person relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or the
assets (including equity securities) of Duke and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (a " _Duke Material_

 



-53-    _Business_ "), (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20%
or more of any class of voting securities of Duke or any subsidiary of Duke
owning, operating or controlling a Duke Material Business, (iii) any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of voting securities of Duke, or
(iv) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Duke or any
subsidiary of Duke owning, operating or controlling a Duke Material Business,
in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and provided that Duke has otherwise complied
with this Section 4.04(a), nothing in this Section 4.04(a) shall prohibit Duke
or its directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents
from contacting in writing any person who has made a Duke Takeover Proposal
after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof to the extent necessary to permit it to determine
whether the Duke Takeover Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in,
a Duke Superior Proposal.

(b) Except as contemplated by this Section 4.04, neither the Board of
Directors of Duke nor any committee thereof shall (A) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Progress, the
approval or recommendation to Dukes shareholders by such Board of Directors
or such committee of the Duke Share Issuance or Duke Charter Amendment, (B)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Duke
Takeover Proposal, or (C) cause Duke to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
(each, a " _Duke Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Duke Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 

(i) in response to a Duke Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach
(other than in immaterial respects) of Section 4.04(a), during the Duke
Applicable Period, the Board of Directors of Duke may, if it determines in
good faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board of
Directors fiduciary obligations under applicable law, (A) withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation by
such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of the Duke Share Issuance
or Duke Charter Amendment, (B) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Duke Superior Proposal, or (C) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(f), but only after (1) in the case of each
of clauses (B) or (C), such Board of Directors has determined in good faith
that such Duke Takeover Proposal constitutes a Duke Superior Proposal, and (2)
in the case of clause (C), (I) Duke has notified Progress in writing of
the determination that such Duke Takeover Proposal constitutes a Duke
Superior Proposal and (II) at least five business days following receipt by
Progress of such notice, the Board of Directors of Duke has determined that
such Duke Superior Proposal remains a Duke Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that any such Duke Takeover Proposal is
thereafter modified by the person making such Duke Takeover Proposal and the
Board of Directors determines pursuant to clause (C) to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f), Duke shall again comply with clauses
(I) and (II) of this paragraph (b)(i) except that the five business-day period
shall be reduced to two business days; and 

(ii) in circumstances other than in response to a Duke Takeover Proposal as
provided in Section 4.04(b)(i), during the Duke Applicable Period, the Board
of Directors of Duke may, if it determines in good faith, after consulting
with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary

 



-54-   obligations under applicable law, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors
or any committee thereof of the Duke Share Issuance or Duke Charter
Amendment, but only after (1) Duke has notified Progress in writing that the
Board of Directors of Duke is prepared to make the determination set forth in
this clause (ii) setting forth the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, (2)
for a period of five business days following Progresss receipt of the notice
set forth in clause (1) of this sentence (or, if the period from the time of
receipt by Progress of such notice to the Duke Shareholders Meeting shall be
less than five business days, for such lesser period), Duke negotiates with
Progress in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
would enable the Duke Board of Directors to proceed with its recommendation of
the Duke Share Issuance and the Duke Charter Amendment and (3) at the end of
such five-business day period (or such lesser period, as the case may be, in
accordance with this clause (ii)) the Board of Directors of Duke maintains its
determination described in this clause (ii) (after taking into account
Progresss proposed adjustments, if any, to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby).

For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Duke Superior Proposal_ " means any
written Duke Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Duke determines
in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable (taking into account (i) all
financial and strategic considerations, including relevant legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Duke Takeover Proposal and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement deemed relevant by the
Board of Directors, (ii) the identity of the third party making such Duke
Takeover Proposal, and (iii) the conditions and prospects for completion of
such Duke Takeover Proposal) to Dukes shareholders than the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account
all of the terms of any proposal by Progress to amend or modify the terms of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except
that (x) the references to "20%" in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the
definition of "Duke Takeover Proposal" in Section 4.04(a) shall each be deemed
to be a reference to "50%", (y) a "Duke Takeover Proposal" shall only be
deemed to refer to a transaction involving Duke, and not any of its
subsidiaries or Duke Material Businesses alone, and (z) the references to "or
any subsidiary of Duke owning, operating or controlling a Duke Material
Business" in clauses (ii) and (iv) shall be deemed to be deleted.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Duke set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 4.04, Duke shall as promptly as practicable advise
Progress, orally and in writing, of any Duke Takeover Proposal or of any
request for information relating to any Duke Takeover Proposal (and in any
case within 48 hours of such request or the receipt of such Duke Takeover
Proposal), the principal terms and conditions of such request or Duke Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the person making such request or Duke Takeover
Proposal. Duke shall keep Progress informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or Duke Takeover Proposal. Contemporaneously with any termination by
Duke of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i), Duke shall provide
Progress with a written verification that it has complied with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 4.04(c) (other than noncompliance which is
immaterial). 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Duke or its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated

 



-55-   by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to Dukes shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of Duke, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with its or Dukes obligations under applicable
law or (ii) taking actions permitted by Section 4.02(f).

 

Section 4.05 _Other Actions_. Each of Progress and Duke shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not
to permit any of its respective subsidiaries to, take any action that would,
or that could reasonably be expected to, result in (i) any of the
representations and warranties of such party set forth in this Agreement that
is qualified as to materiality or material adverse effect becoming untrue,
(ii) any of such representations and warranties that is not so qualified
becoming untrue in any material respect, or (iii) any condition to the Merger
set forth in Article VI not being satisfied.

Section 4.06 _Coordination of Dividends_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, Duke and Progress shall coordinate with
each other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect of
the shares of Progress Common Stock and Duke Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of Progress and
Duke that no holder of Progress Common Stock or Duke Common Stock shall
receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single
calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Progress Common Stock or Duke
Common Stock (including Duke Common Stock issued in connection with the
Merger), as the case may be. In furtherance of and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if at the time that Progress would otherwise
declare a regular quarterly cash dividend pursuant to Section 4.01(c)(i)(A)
the parties expect the Closing Date to occur during the period of time from
and after the record date for such Progress dividend and prior to the record
date for the next subsequent regular quarterly cash dividend of Duke, the
parties shall coordinate to reduce the amount of such Progress dividend to an
amount reasonably calculated to effectuate the intent of the parties described
in the first sentence of this Section 4.06. In the event (a) the Closing Date
would, in the absence of this Section 4.06, occur after the record date for
the last regular quarterly cash dividend of Progress prior to the Closing Date
and prior to the record date for the next subsequent regular quarterly cash
dividend of Duke and (b) such last recent Progress regular quarterly cash
dividend occurring prior to the Closing shall not have been reduced as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, Duke shall be permitted to (i)
declare and pay a special dividend to Duke stockholders immediately prior to
the Closing in an amount reasonably calculated to effectuate the intent of the
parties described in the first sentence of this Section 4.06 or (ii) subject
to the prior written consent of Progress (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), postpone the Closing to a date no later than one
business day after the record date for the next succeeding regular quarterly
cash dividend of Duke (in which event Progress shall be permitted to declare
and pay a special dividend immediately prior to the Closing in an amount
reasonably calculated to effectuate the intent of the parties described in the
first sentence of this Section 4.06, and neither party shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) during the period of
such postponement).

Section 5.04 _Access to Information; Effect of Review_.

 

(a) _Access_. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, each of Progress and Duke shall, and shall cause
each of its respective subsidiaries to, and, so long as consistent with its
confidentiality obligations under its applicable agreements, shall use its
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Progress Joint Ventures and
Duke Joint Ventures, respectively, to, afford to the other party and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives of such other party reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective

representatives of the other party to discuss material operational and
regulatory matters and the general status of its ongoing operations, (ii)
advise the other party of any change or event that has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on such party, and
(iii) furnish promptly all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel, in each case as such other party may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no actions shall be taken pursuant to
this Section 5.04(a) that would create a risk of loss or waiver of the
attorney/client privilege, provided, further, that the parties shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to allow for access and
disclosure of information in a manner reasonably acceptable to the parties
that does not result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client privilege
(which efforts shall include entering into mutually acceptable joint defense
agreements between the parties if doing so would reasonably permit the
disclosure of information without violating applicable law or jeopardizing
such attorney-client privilege). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party
requests access to proprietary information of the other party, the disclosure
of which would have a material adverse effect on the other party if the
Closing were not to occur (giving effect to the requesting partys
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement), such information shall only
be disclosed to the extent reasonably agreed upon by the chief financial
officers (or their designees) of Progress and Duke. All information exchanged
pursuant to this Section 5.04(a) shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



-59-  (b) _Effect of Review_. No review pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall have
any effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation

hereto.

Section 5.05 _Regulatory Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a)  _Regulatory Approvals_. Each party hereto shall cooperate and promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions and filings, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things in order to obtain all approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities, necessary or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Progress Required Statutory Approvals and the Duke Required Statutory
Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ , that Progress shall have
primary responsibility for the preparation and filing of any related
applications, filings or other materials with the FPSC and the NCUC and PSCSC,
_provided_ , _further_ , that Duke shall have primary responsibility for the
preparation and filing of any related applications, filings or other
materials with the PUCO, the IURC and the KPSC. Progress shall have the right
to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information
relating to Progress, on the one hand, and Duke shall have the right to
review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information
relating to Duke, on the other hand, in either case, that appear in any
application, notice, petition or filing made in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Progress and Duke
agree that they will consult and cooperate with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all such necessary approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Authorities.

 

(b) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable law) to take, or cause
to be taken, promptly all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, promptly
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary Consents or waivers from third parties and
Governmental Authorities, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "reasonable best efforts" shall not include nor require either
party or its subsidiaries to (A) sell, or agree to sell, hold or agree to
hold separate, or otherwise dispose or agree to dispose of any asset, in each
case if such sale, separation or disposition or agreement with respect thereto
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to such party, or (B) conduct or agree to
conduct its business in any particular manner if such conduct or agreement
with respect thereto would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such party, or (C) agree to
any order, action or regulatory condition of any regulatory body, whether in
an approval proceeding or another regulatory proceeding, that, if effected,
would cause a material reduction in the expected benefits for such partys
shareholders (for example, the parties expect their customers to participate
in the

 



-60-   benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in amounts up to
but not exceeding (x) the benefits of joint system dispatch and fuel savings
as they materialize in future fuel clause proceedings and (y) rates that are
lower than they otherwise would have been as net merger savings materialize in
future rate proceedings initiated in the ordinary course of business) (any of
the foregoing effects, a " _Burdensome Effect_ ").

(c) _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of Section
5.05(b), Progress and Duke shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that
no state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.06 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock and Equity Awards;
Stock Plans_. (a) At the Effective Time, each Progress Employee Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Progress Employee
Stock Option, including vesting, a number of shares of Duke Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Progress Common Stock subject to such
Progress Employee Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) at
a price per share of Duke Common Stock equal to the price per share under such
Progress Employee Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to
the nearest cent) (each, as so adjusted, a " _Progress Adjusted Option_ ");

(i) at the Effective Time, each award of restricted shares of Progress Common
Stock (" _Progress Restricted Stock_ ") shall be converted into an award of a
number of restricted shares of Duke Common Stock equal to the number of
restricted shares of Progress Common Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such award of
restricted shares of Progress Common Stock, including vesting (" _Progress
Adjusted Restricted Stock_ ");

(ii) at the Effective Time, each Progress Restricted Stock Unit shall be
converted into an award of a number of restricted stock units of Duke Common
Stock equal to the number of restricted stock units of Progress Common Stock
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such award of restricted stock units of Progress Common Stock,
including vesting (" _Progress Adjusted Restricted Stock Units_ ");

(iii) at the Effective Time, each Progress Performance Share shall be assumed
and converted into an award of a number of performance shares of Duke Common
Stock equal to the number of performance shares of Progress Common Stock
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such award of performance shares of Progress Common Stock,
including vesting, and the performance measurement period for such performance
shares shall remain open (such that no payments shall be made under the terms
of such performance shares solely as a result of or in connection with the
Merger) and the

 



-61-   Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Duke shall adjust the
performance measures of such performance shares as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time as it determines is appropriate and equitable to reflect
the performance of Progress during the performance measurement period prior to
the Effective Time, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
performance measures under awards made to similarly situated Duke employees
for the same or comparable performance cycle (the " _Progress Adjusted
Performance Shares_ ");

(iv) all outstanding Other Progress Equity Awards, whether vested or unvested,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
equity or equity-based award in respect of a number of shares of Duke Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Progress Common Stock represented by
such award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Progress equity or equity-based award, including
vesting (" _Other Progress Adjusted Equity Awards_ "); and

(v) prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Progress (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Progress Employee Stock Option
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the foregoing and to ensure that the conversion pursuant
to Section 2.01(b) of the Progress Common Stock held by any director or
officer of Progress and the conversion pursuant to this Section 5.06(a) into
Progress Adjusted Options of Progress Employee Stock Options, Progress
Adjusted Restricted Stock of Progress Restricted Stock, Progress Adjusted
Restricted Stock Units of Progress Restricted Stock Units, Progress Adjusted
Performance Shares of Progress Performance Shares and Other Progress Adjusted
Equity Awards of Other Progress Equity Awards held by any director or officer

Exchange Act.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Duke shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to ensure to
the maximum extent permitted by law that the conversion pursuant to Section
2.01(a) of the Progress Common Stock held by any director or officer of
Progress and the conversion pursuant to Section 5.06(a) will be eligible for
exemption under Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act. Prior to the Effective
Time, Progress shall deliver to the holders of Progress Adjusted Options,
Progress Adjusted Restricted Stock, Progress Adjusted Restricted Stock Units,
Progress Adjusted Performance Shares and Other Progress Adjusted Equity
Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
respective plans and this Agreement (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ").

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Stock Plans shall be
assumed by Duke, with the result that all obligations of Progress under the
Stock Plans, including with respect to awards outstanding at the Effective
Time under each Stock Plan, shall be obligations of Duke following the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Duke shall take all necessary
actions for the assumption of the Stock Plans, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Duke Common Stock in a number at least
equal to the number of shares of Duke Common Stock that will be subject to
Progress Adjusted Options, Progress Adjusted Restricted Stock Units, Progress
Adjusted Performance Shares and Other Progress Adjusted Equity Awards. As
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Duke or its subsidiaries
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Duke Common Stock
determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. Such

 



-62-   registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least
for so long as Progress Adjusted Options, Progress Adjusted Restricted Stock
Units, Progress Adjusted Performance Shares and Other Progress Adjusted Equity
Awards remain outstanding.

Section 5.07 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the
Duke Employee Benefit Plans and the Progress Employee Benefit Plans in effect
as of the date of this Agreement and at the Effective Time shall remain in
effect with respect to employees and former employees of Duke or Progress and
their subsidiaries (the " _Newco Employees_ "), respectively, covered by such
Plans at the Effective Time, until such time as Duke and Progress together
shall otherwise determine, subject to applicable laws and the terms of such
plans. Prior to the Effective Time, Duke and Progress shall cooperate in
reviewing, evaluating and analyzing Duke Employee Benefit Plans and Progress
Employee Benefit Plans with a view towards maintaining appropriate Plans for
Newco Employees.

(b) With respect to any Plans in which any Newco Employees who are employees
of Duke or Progress (or their subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such Newco Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), Duke shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts, subject to applicable law, to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Newco Employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Duke
Employee Benefit Plan or Progress Employee Benefit Plan, as the case may be;
(ii) provide each Newco Employee and their eligible dependents with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a
Duke Employee Benefit Plan or Progress Employee Benefit Plan (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous Duke Employee
Benefit Plan or Progress Employee Benefit Plan, as applicable, prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize all service of the
Newco Employees with Progress and Duke, and their respective affiliates, for
all purposes (including, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with respect to defined benefit
pension plans, benefit accrual) in any New Plan in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, including any severance
plan, to the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable
New Plan; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Duke and Progress shall cooperate to
establish common retention, relocation and severance policies or plans that
apply to Newco Employees on and after the Effective Time; provided, however,
that for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), each Newco
Employee who was an employee of Progress immediately prior to the Effective
Time whose employment is terminated during the Continuation Period shall be
eligible to receive severance benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions
no less favorable than those provided to employees of Progress pursuant to
plans or policies in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, the Progress CIC Plan (as defined in Section
5.07(d)).

 



-63-  (d) Duke acknowledges and agrees that (i) it will assume, as of the Effective
Time, all obligations under the Progress Energy, Inc. Management Change-in-
Control Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2008 but after
giving effect to the amendment of the definition of "Good Reason" set forth
in Section 4.01(d)(iii) of the Progress Disclosure Letter (the " _Progress
CIC Plan_ ") and (ii) a termination of employment from Duke and its affiliates
shall be the same as a termination of employment from Progress and
its affiliates for all purposes under the Progress CIC Plan.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Progress shall (i) amend the definition of
Committee set forth in Section 2.9 of the Progress CIC Plan by deleting the
last sentence of such definition in its entirety and (ii) either amend the
Progress CIC Plan or prescribe terms in the applicable award agreement
to provide that, except as set forth in Section 4.01(d)(iii) of the Progress
Disclosure Letter, for all equity awards granted under the Progress Employee
Stock Option Plans to participants in the Progress CIC Plan after the date
hereof, the definition of "good reason" or similar concept of constructive
termination relating to such awards shall be as defined in Section
4.01(d)(iii) of the Progress Disclosure Letter. Progress also acknowledges and
agrees that (A) neither Progress nor any of its subsidiaries will take any
actions to fund any grantor trust or similar vehicle that it currently
maintains, or may maintain at any time following the date hereof, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) prior
to the Effective Time, Progress will take all actions necessary to amend (x)
any grantor trust maintained by Progress to eliminate any requirement to fund
any such grantor trust in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (y) any Progress Employee Benefit Plan requiring the
establishment or funding of a grantor trust to eliminate such requirement.

 

(f) Duke acknowledges and agrees that it shall assume, as of the Effective
Time, all obligations under the Amended and Restated Supplemental Senior
Executive Retirement Plan of Progress Energy, Inc. (the " _SERP_ ");
_provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit Progress or its affiliates or
their respective successors and assigns from modifying, amending or
terminating the provisions of the SERP in any manner in accordance with its
terms and applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ that no modification,
amendment or termination shall adversely affect a participants accrued
benefit or the right to payment thereof under the provisions of the SERP as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or termination.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following the Effective
Time, in the event that the SERP is amended in a manner that would otherwise
reduce a participants right to accrue future benefits under the SERP, Duke
shall provide such participant with the opportunity to earn additional
benefits under the SERP (or another compensation or benefit arrangement)
equal to no less than the incremental amount that the participant would have
earned under the SERP (i.e., due to the accrual of additional years of Service
(as defined in the SERP)) in the absence of such amendment, except that such
incremental amount shall be calculated after treating the participants Final
Average Salary (as defined in the SERP) as if it was solely based on
compensation earned by the participant prior to the Effective Time, as
increased after the Effective Time by cost of living adjustments. Progress
shall amend the SERP as soon as practicable after the date hereof to provide
that no individual may become a participant in the SERP following the date of
this Agreement.

 

(g) At the Effective Time, outstanding awards under the Progress Management
Incentive Compensation Plan shall be assumed and the performance period for
each such award shall remain open (such that no payments shall be made under
the terms of the Progress

 



-64-   Management Incentive Compensation Plan solely as a result of or in
connection with the Merger) at a level and providing an annual incentive
compensation opportunity that is not less than the level and annual incentive
compensation opportunity under the existing Progress Management Incentive
Compensation Plan and the applicable performance criteria and vesting
requirements for each such award shall be adjusted by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Duke as it determines is
appropriate and equitable to reflect the performance of Progress during the
performance period prior to the Effective Time, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the performance measures under awards made to similarly
situated Duke employees as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(h) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.06, the provisions of this
Section 5.07 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor or
any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Progress Employee
Benefit Plan, Duke Employee Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit
plan or arrangement for any purpose.

Section 5.08 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) Each of Duke,
Merger Sub and Progress agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, all rights to indemnification, advancement and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and
employees and the fiduciaries currently indemnified under benefit plans of
Progress and its subsidiaries, as provided in their respective certificate
or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) or other agreements providing indemnification, advancement or
exculpation shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, and no such provision in any
certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable
organizational document) or other agreement shall be amended, modified or
repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder to any such individual with respect to acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time. In addition, from and after the Effective
Time, all directors, officers and employees and all fiduciaries
currently indemnified under benefit plans of Progress or its subsidiaries who
become directors, officers, employees or fiduciaries under benefit plans of
Duke will be entitled to the indemnity, advancement and exculpation rights and
protections afforded to directors, officers and employees or fiduciaries
under benefit plans of Duke. From and after the Effective Time, Duke shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor and perform, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 5.08 without limit as to time.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Duke shall maintain in effect the
directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance policies
currently maintained by Progress covering acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
covered by Progresss respective directors and officers liability (and
fiduciary) insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in
amounts no less favorable than those set forth in the relevant policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the annual cost thereof
shall not exceed 300% of the annual cost of such policies as of the date
hereof. If such no less favorable insurance coverage cannot be maintained for
such cost, Duke shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors
and officers insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost. Prior to the
Effective Time, Progress may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy 

 



-65-   on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Progress Indemnified
Parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of Sections 5.08(a) and
(b), as applicable, than the existing directors and officers liability (and
fiduciary) insurance maintained by Progress, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the aggregate cost thereof
shall not exceed 600% of the annual cost of the directors and officers
liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by Progress as of the date
hereof. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by Progress prior to
the Effective Time, it shall satisfy the obligations set forth in the first
two sentences of this paragraph (b) and Duke shall, after the Effective Time,
maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and continue
to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Duke will cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present director and officer
of Progress or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, for acts or failures to
act in such capacity), determined as of the date hereof, and any person who
becomes such a director or officer between the date hereof and the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Progress Indemnified Parties_ "), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (and Duke will cause the
Surviving Corporation to also advance expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses) as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that if required by applicable law
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination as to
whether a Progress Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses hereunder pursuant to applicable law shall be made by
independent counsel jointly selected by the Surviving Corporation and such
Progress Indemnified Party.

(d) The obligations of Duke and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.08 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Progress Indemnified Party, or any other person entitled
to the benefit of Sections 5.08(a) and (b), as the case may be, to whom this
Section 5.08 applies without the consent of the affected Progress Indemnified
Party, or such other person, as the case may be. If Duke, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Duke or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of
the obligations of Duke, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set
forth in this Section 5.08.

 

(e) The provisions of Section 5.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification, advancement, exculpation or contribution
that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

5.09, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is

printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement (including
SEC filing fees), (2) the filings of the premerger notification and report

real property and (ii) the transfer of Progress Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement as a result of the Merger. Progress and Duke shall cooperate with
respect to the filing of such returns, including supplying any information
that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

(b) Progress shall immediately pay Duke a fee equal to $400 million (the "
_Progress Termination Fee_ ") minus any amounts as may have been previously
paid by Progress pursuant to Section 5.09(d), payable by wire transfer of same
day funds, in the event that:

applicable or (iii) if the Board of Directors of the applicable party
determines in good faith that failure to do so could reasonably be expected to

party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

(c) by Progress, if Duke shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

any liability or obligation on the part of Progress or Duke, other than the
provisions of Section 5.09, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII, which
provisions shall survive such termination, and except to the extent that such
termination results from the willful and material breach by a party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, in which case such termination shall not relieve any party of any
liability or damages resulting from its willful and material breach of this
Agreement (including any such case in which a Progress Termination Fee or a

Duke in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are,
payable pursuant to Section 5.09 to Progress or Duke, as the case may be (the

circumstance in which Duke is the Injured Party, or the Duke Termination Fee,
in the circumstance in which Progress is the Injured Party and any expenses
payable pursuant to Section 5.09 to the Injured Party, it being the intent
that any Progress Termination Fee, Duke Termination Fee and any expenses paid
to the Injured Party shall serve as a credit against and off-set any liability
or damage suffered by the Injured Party to the extent of such payment).

 



-75-  (b) In the event Duke terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(h)(i)
as a result of the Board of Directors of Progress having withdrawn or
modified, or proposed to publicly withdraw or modify, the approval or

was made primarily due to adverse conditions, events or actions of or
relating to Duke, in any judicial, court or tribunal proceeding in which the
payment of the Progress Termination Fee is at issue under the proviso in
Section 5.09(b)(iv), whether brought or initiated by Duke or Progress,
Progress shall have the burden of proving that the Board of Directors of
Progress withdrew or modified, or proposed publicly to withdraw or modify, the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors of this Agreement or
the Merger primarily due to adverse conditions, events or actions of or
relating to Duke.

(c) In the event Progress terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(g)(i) as a result of the Board of Directors of Duke having withdrawn or
modified, or proposed to publicly withdraw or modify, the approval or

Duke Charter Amendment that was made primarily due to adverse conditions,
events or actions of or relating to Progress, in any judicial, court or
tribunal proceeding in which the payment of the Duke Termination Fee is at

by Progress or Duke, Duke shall have the burden of proving that the Board of
Directors of Duke withdrew or modified, or proposed publicly to withdraw or

Share Issuance and the Duke Charter Amendment primarily due to adverse
conditions, events or actions of or relating to Progress.

 

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after the Duke Shareholder Approval or the Progress
Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval,
there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by
the shareholders of Duke or Progress without the further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 7.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)

with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

face of the information disclosed in the disclosure letter to the person to

disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to

sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement without notice or liability to any other person.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties and may have been qualified
by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of this Agreement.
Accordingly, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 8.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless

that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of

any other state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), (iii)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iv) agrees not to
bring any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

TERM SHEET

 

WILLIAM D. JOHNSON

As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this term sheet
but in any event prior to the effective date of the closing of the merger (the
"Merger") contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Duke
Energy Corporation ("Duke"), Progress Energy, Inc. ("Progress") and Diamond
Acquisition Corporation (the "Merger Agreement"), Duke will take such action
(or cause its affiliates to take such action) as may be necessary
and appropriate to effectuate a new employment agreement to be entered into
or assumed by Duke for William D. Johnson (the "Executive"), which agreement
shall take effect as of the Merger. Effective upon the closing of the Merger
and until such time as a new employment agreement becomes effective, this
term sheet shall govern the respective parties rights and obligations and
shall constitute an amendment of the Executives employment agreement when
deemed effective as provided herein. The new employment agreement shall be
governed by the following provisions.



   1. | _Basic Premise_  The new employment agreement shall be
substantially similar to the form of the current employment agreement for
Dukes current CEO, except as otherwise described below. 
---|--- 



   2. | _Role_  The Executive shall be named as President and CEO of
Duke effective upon the Merger, which will require conforming changes to the
new employment agreement. 
---|--- 



   3. | _Term_  Three-year term of employment commencing upon the
closing of the Merger. 
---|--- 
 



   4. | Ongoing Compensation 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Annual Base Salary_  $1,100,000. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Short-Term Incentive Plan_  The Executive shall be
eligible to participate in the applicable Duke short-term incentive plan, with
a target opportunity of 125% of annual base salary. The terms and conditions
of the Executives short-term incentive compensation opportunities shall be
substantially similar to the short-term incentive compensation opportunities
provided to other executive officers of Duke, as determined by the Duke
Compensation Committee from time to time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | _Long-Term Incentives_  The Executive shall be eligible to
participate in the applicable Duke long-term incentive plan, with a target
opportunity of 500% of annual base salary. The terms and conditions (e.g.,
performance measures, vesting schedules, allocation between performance and
phantom shares) of the Executives long-term incentive awards shall be
substantially similar to the long-term incentive awards granted to other
executive officers of Duke, as determined by the Duke Compensation Committee
from time to time. 
---|---|--- 
 



-1-       | (d) | _Adjustments_  Given the time period between the effective
date of this term sheet and the anticipated date of the closing of the Merger,
the Duke Compensation Committee will review benchmark data and reserves
discretion to increase the compensation of the Executive if determined to be
appropriate after taking into account the compensation provided to CEOs of
Dukes peer group.  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | _Employee Benefits_  The Executive shall be entitled to
employee benefits (e.g., retirement plans, health and insurance plans,
perquisites) as determined by the Duke Compensation Committee from time to
time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | _SERP_  The Executives benefit under the Amended and
Restated Supplemental Senior Executive Retirement Plan of Progress Energy,
Inc. (the "SERP") shall be treated in the same manner as the benefit of other
executives in the SERP who are employed with Duke following the closing of the
Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 



   5. | _Impact of Termination of Employment_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If the Executive is involuntarily terminated without cause
or quits for good reason following, but prior to the second anniversary of,
the closing of the Merger, he will be entitled to severance equal to the
benefits provided under the Progress Energy Inc. Management Change-in-Control
Plan, as amended from time to time, except that no tax gross-up shall be
provided, and the parties shall use their best efforts to structure the
severance in a manner that eliminates or reduces the impact of Sections 280G
and 4999 of the tax code. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If the Executive is involuntarily terminated without cause
or quits for good reason following the second anniversary of, but prior to the
third anniversary of, the closing of the Merger, he will be entitled to the
severance provided under his current employment agreement, as amended from
time to time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | For purposes of determining whether the Executive has "good
reason" to terminate employment or a "constructive termination" has occurred,
his move to Charlotte, NC, Sections 2.13(b) and 2.13(c) of the Progress
Energy, Inc. Management Change-in-Control Plan and Section 8(a)(i) of his
current employment agreement, shall be disregarded. 
---|---|--- 
 



   6. | _Other Matters_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Relocation Benefits_  The Executive will be reimbursed
for direct and indirect relocation costs, provided that the Executive shall
not receive a tax gross-up or indemnification for any such relocation costs
that constitute income to the Executive. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Advisor Fees_  The Executive will be reimbursed for
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this term
sheet and the new employment agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



-2-       | (c) | _Corporate Aircraft_  The Executive will be subject to
substantially the same policies as currently in effect for Dukes current
CEO.  
---|---|---

JAMES E. ROGERS

As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this term sheet,
but in any event prior to the Effective Time of the Merger contemplated by the
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Duke Energy Corporation, Progress

James E. Rogers (the "Executive") and Duke will each use their commercially
reasonable efforts to amend (or cause their respective affiliates to amend)
the employment agreement by and between the Executive and Duke, dated as of
February 19, 2009 (the "Current Agreement"), as may be necessary and
appropriate to effectuate the terms of the Executives employment following

following the Merger and will cease to be employed as President and Chief
Executive Officer of Duke as of the Effective Time. The Executive will
continue to report directly to the Board of Directors of Duke and his roles
and responsibilities will be those set forth on Exhibit B to the Merger
Agreement. In no event will the foregoing amendments to the Current Agreement
provide the Executive with the right to terminate his employment for "Good
Reason" (as defined in the Current Agreement) under Section 10(b) of the
Current Agreement. 
---|--- 



   3. | _Term_  The Executives term of employment will end on the later
of (i) December 31, 2013 and (ii) the second anniversary of the Effective
Time, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the Current
Agreement. 
---|--- 



   4. | _Ongoing Compensation_  The Executives compensation will remain
the same in all respects as under the Current Agreement through December 31,
2013. Should the term of employment continue beyond December 31, 2013 and the
Executive continue to serve as Executive Chair as of that date, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Duke will address the
Executives compensation for the remaining term of his employment at that
time. 
---|--- 



   5. | _Advisor Fees_  The Executive will be reimbursed for reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this term sheet and
the amendment to the Current Agreement.
