---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place (a) at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the
Atlanta, Georgia offices of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, on a date to be
mutually agreed upon by the Parties, but in no event later than the third
(3rd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII _to be satisfied or waived (other than
any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law,
waiver of such conditions at the Closing) or (b) at such other date or place
as is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the
Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date."

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and
Parent shall (a) cause articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the
"Articles of Merger") to be duly executed and filed with the State Department
of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "SDAT") in accordance with the
MGCL, and (b) make any other filings, recordings or publications required to
be made by the Company or Parent under the MGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of
Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT, or on such later date and time
(not to exceed five (5) business days after the date the Articles of Merger
are accepted for record by the SDAT) as shall be agreed to by the Company and
Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time being
hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Effective Time").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_. At the Merger Effective Time,
the Parent Charter and the Parent Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time, shall be the charter and bylaws of the Surviving
Entity, until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.4_ , in accordance
with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of such charter and bylaws.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity_. The

as of the Merger Effective Time until such person's successor is duly elected
or appointed in accordance with applicable Law and the governing documents of
the Surviving Entity.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Tax Consequences_. The Parties intend that, for U.S.
Federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this
Agreement hereby is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Contribution to Parent Operating Partnership_.
Immediately following the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall contribute all
of its membership interests in the Company General Partner and all of its
limited partnership interests in the Company Operating Partnership to the
Parent Operating Partnership in exchange for a number of Parent OP Units equal
to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger, cash and
other property as may be reasonably required to effect the Transactions.

  



  

Section 1.8 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Merger
Effective Time the Surviving Entity shall determine, in its sole and absolute
discretion, that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights or properties of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the Surviving Entity may take all such actions as may be

ARTICLE II 
 TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

  



  

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_. At the Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders of any securities of the Company or of Parent:

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (other than Company Shares held by the Company, any wholly
owned Company Subsidiary, Parent or any wholly owned Parent Subsidiary) shall
be cancelled and retired and automatically converted into the right to receive
the following consideration (the "Merger Consideration"): (i) 0.235 (the
"Exchange Ratio") of a duly authorized, fully paid, non-assessable and
validly issued share of Parent Common Stock, subject to adjustment as provided
in _Section 2.1(c)(ii)_ ; _plus_ (ii) the right to receive any Fractional
Share Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6_ without interest (together with
the shares issuable under the foregoing subsection (i), the "Stock
Consideration"); _plus_ (iii) an amount in cash equal to $2.00 without
interest (the "Cash Consideration"), subject to adjustment as provided in
_Section 2.1(c)(i)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time that is held by the Company or any wholly owned Company Subsidiary or by
Parent or any wholly owned Parent Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no payment or other consideration shall be made with respect thereto.
From and after the Merger Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Share shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor upon the surrender of such Company Share in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ , including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.6_ ,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, for which
such shares of Company Common Stock have the right to be exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the "Fractional Share Consideration"),
together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Parent Capital Stock_. All shares of capital
stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding as shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

(c) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(i) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Merger Effective
Time so as to provide the holders of Company Common Stock with the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ , shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Parent Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding after the
date hereof and prior to the Merger Effective Time so as to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock with the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after
the date of such event, be the applicable Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)(ii)_ , shall be construed to permit Parent to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _The Pre-Closing Dividend_. The Company shall declare a special
dividend of $0.21 per share of Company Common Stock payable to the holders of
record of Company Common Stock as of the end of trading on the NYSE on the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date payable together with the
Cash Consideration and Fractional Share Consideration from the Exchange Fund
in accordance with  _Section 2.2_ (the "Pre-Closing Dividend"). Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Pre-Closing Dividend; _provided_ that,
if (i) Parent, within three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date,
provides notice to the Company requesting that the Company deposit such
cash for the Pre-Closing Dividend with the Exchange Agent, and (ii) the
Company has sufficient cash to pay for all or a portion of the Pre-Closing
Dividend available in its operating bank accounts or available and able to be
drawn under the Company Credit Agreement, then the Company shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent all or such portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend available
in its operating bank accounts or able to be drawn under the Company Credit
Agreement; _provided further_ that, if the Company only has a portion of the
Pre-Closing Dividend available in its operating bank accounts or available and
able to be drawn under the Company Credit Agreement, then Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent the remaining amount of cash necessary to pay
the Pre-Closing Dividend in full.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement,
Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in connection
with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to the Merger Effective Time,
Parent (or, with respect to the Pre-Closing Dividend but subject to _Section
2.1(d)_ , the Company) shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of
Parent Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_
 and _Section 2.4_ equal to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1_  and _Section 2.4_ (excluding
any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration,
Fractional Share Consideration, Pre-Closing Dividend and any dividends or
other distributions under _Section 2.2(e)_ (such evidence of book-entry
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts, the "Exchange Fund"), in each
case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
the holders of Company Restricted Shares and the Surviving Entity (in the
case of the Surviving Entity, solely to the extent any amounts in the Exchange
Fund are in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and
_Section 2.1(d)_ ). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
pay the aggregate Cash Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration, Pre-
Closing Dividend and any dividends or other distributions under _Section
2.2(e)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange
Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to
make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the
Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including any
Fractional Share Consideration, any amounts payable in accordance with
_Section 2.2(e)_ and the Pre-Closing Dividend, out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash
portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment
of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations
of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article
II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to the Surviving Entity on the earlier of one (1) year after the Merger
Effective Time or the Exchange Fund has been paid in full; _provided_ , that
any amounts in the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section 2.1(a)_  and _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be promptly paid to the
Surviving Entity.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Merger Effective
Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days after the
Merger Effective Time), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for collection by
hand) to each holder of record of Company Shares, all of which are held in
"book-entry" form (the "Book-Entry Shares"), whose Company Shares were
exchanged pursuant to _Section 2.1_ for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, instructions for effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration for which such Company Shares are to
be exchanged, including, any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_ , and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. Upon surrender of a Book-
Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Entity and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) the
Stock Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (rounded
down to the nearest whole share), (2) the Cash Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ , (3) an amount representing any Fractional
Share Consideration that such holder of a Book-Entry Share has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 2.6_ , (4) the Pre-Closing
Dividend, pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ and (5) any amounts
that such holder of a Book-Entry Share has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share. The amounts due
pursuant to clauses (2), (3), (4) and (5) shall be made via check or wire or
other electronic transfer of immediately available funds (at each such
holder's election) within five (5) business days following the later to occur
of the Merger Effective Time or the Exchange Agent's receipt of such Book-
Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.2_ , each Book-Entry Share shall at any time after the Merger
Effective Time represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , including any amount
payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.6_ and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Shares_. At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the

of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after
the Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the
Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is
pending subject only to the Exchange Agent's routine administrative
procedures, to holders of Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_ and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ , payable upon due
surrender of their Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in

foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any holder of a Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to such date on which
the related Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_ )
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, any such Merger Consideration (and such dividends and
distributions) in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Book-Entry Share, there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Merger
Effective Time but prior to such surrender, previously paid with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent

provisions of this _Section 2.4_ shall be effectuated without any action on
the part of the holder of any Company Restricted Share or any Company RSU.

  



  

(a) Each outstanding Company Restricted Share shall vest in full at
the Merger Effective Time and be cancelled and retired and
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional Share Consideration, any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ and the Pre-Closing Dividend. As of the Merger
Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.2_ and the Pre-Closing Dividend.

  



  

(b) Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time shall, at the Merger Effective Time, be cancelled

Section 2.5 _Interest; Withholding_. All amounts payable pursuant
to this _Article II_ shall be paid without interest (unless otherwise
noted). Any payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be net of all
applicable withholding Taxes that the Company, Parent, the Surviving Entity
and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law (including, but not limited to, Section 1445 of
the Code). To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
applicable payor and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

Section 2.6 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Book-Entry
Shares, Parent shall pay each holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock held at the Merger Effective Time by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price on the NYSE, as reported on
the consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for
a share of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding
the Merger Effective Time.

remediated) and no change in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company
is not aware of any change in its internal control over financial
reporting that has occurred during its most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Since September 28, 2016,
(x) the Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to the Company and required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, (y) such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company to material information
relating to the Company required to be included in the reports the Company is
required to file under the Exchange Act, and (z) there have not been any
disclosures by the Company's principal executive officer or its principal
financial officer to the Company's independent registered public accounting
firm and the audit committee of the Company Board in respect of any (A) known
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, or (B)
any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and the statements contained in all such
certifications were, as of their respective dates made, true, complete
and correct in all material respects.

Section 3.13 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed with
the appropriate Governmental Authority all U.S. Federal income and all other
material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into account any extensions
of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were
and remain true, complete and correct in all material respects. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on their
behalf), or made adequate provisions for, all material Taxes required to be
paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax Return. True and complete
copies of all U.S. Federal income Tax Returns that have been filed with the
IRS by the Company and each Company Subsidiary with respect to the taxable
years ending on or after December 31, 2014 have been provided or made
available to Parent. The statute of limitations for the assessment of
additional Taxes (or, in the case of the Company Operating Partnership, the
adjustment of items of income, expense or other tax attributes used in the
determination of an assessment of additional Taxes) with respect to the U.S.
Federal income Tax Returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have
expired for all taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2014.

  



  

(b) The Company: (i) for all taxable years commencing with the
taxable year ending December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2017, has been
subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since
January 1, 2018 and will operate to the Merger Effective Time in a manner
consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT;
(iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT
for its taxable year that will end with the Merger Effective Time; and (iv)
has not taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected
to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its
status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending, threatened in writing or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise threatened or asserted.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or
limited liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable
REIT Subsidiary is and has been since its formation treated for U.S. Federal
income Tax purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity or Qualified REIT
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation or a "publicly traded partnership" within the
meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, whose separate existence is respected
for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes. No Company Subsidiary is a corporation
for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation that qualifies
as a REIT, a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary.

  



  

(d) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental
Authority or other proceedings ongoing, threatened in writing or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise threatened or asserted with regard to
any material Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary;
(ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not
yet been settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in
good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
waived any statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of material
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any material Tax
assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv) as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries currently
is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material
Tax Return that remains unfiled; (v) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received a written claim, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, an unwritten claim, by any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction
where any of them does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction; and (vi) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law).

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds, directly
or indirectly, any asset the disposition of which would be subject to (or to
rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code.

  



  

(f) Since its formation, (i) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries have incurred any material liability for Taxes
under Sections 856(c), 856(g)(5)(C), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(5),
857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not
been previously paid, and neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall incur any such liability for such Taxes in the taxable
year that will end with the Merger Effective Time, and (ii) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any other material liability
for Taxes other than (A) in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company or
consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in
connection with a sale, exchange, or other transfer of property. No event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material
risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be
imposed upon the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

  



  

(g) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have complied,
in all material respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under
any state, local or foreign Law) and have duly and timely withheld and, in
each case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the
due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

entered into any written agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect
to any Taxes.

arrangements with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party (other than pursuant to operating leases in which tenants pay certain
taxes and customary arrangements under commercial contracts or borrowings, in
each case, entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company),
and after the Merger Effective Time, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be bound by any such Tax allocation or sharing agreements or
similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods prior to the Merger Effective Time.

  



  

(l) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. Federal income
Tax Return or any other unitary, combined, consolidated or similar Tax group

constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"

stock qualifying (or intended to qualify) for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this
Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of
a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with Transactions.

  



  

(o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than
Taxable REIT Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits
attributable to such entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year
within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.

reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(q) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged at
any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section

, _Section 3.7(c)_ , _Section 3.14_ , _Section 3.15(c)_ , _Section 3.18(b)_
and _Section 3.18(g)_ ).

  



  

Section 3.14 _Pension and Benefit Plans; Employees_.

  



  

(a) _Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a
list, as of the date hereof, of every Employee Benefit Plan
currently maintained or contributed to (or with respect to which any
obligation to contribute has been undertaken) by the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates or pursuant to which the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates has or would reasonably be expected to have any liability (such
Employee Benefit Plans, the "Company Employee Benefit Plans"). Other than the

or former independent contractor, consultant or employee, including retirees,

(b) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Company

under any voluntary compliance or correction policy.

  



  

(c) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
applicable law, including ERISA and the Code. With respect to each Company
Employee Benefit Plan, no prohibited transactions (as defined in ERISA
Section 406 or Code Section 4975) and no violations of ERISA Section 407 for
which an applicable statutory or administrative exemption does not exist have
occurred. No Company Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA,
is a multiemployer plan, within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37), is a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA) or is a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section 413 of the

Company) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Employee Benefit
Plan is the subject of an audit or other inquiry from the Internal Revenue
Service, U.S. Department of Labor, PBGC or other governmental entity. Neither
the Company nor any of its directors, officers, employees or any plan
fiduciary has any liability for failure to comply with ERISA, HIPAA, COBRA or
the Code for any action or failure to act in connection with the
administration or investment of any Company Employee Benefit Plan.

  



    

 | 22|

(f) No Company Employee Benefit Plan provides, and neither the
Company and any of its ERISA Affiliates, has any obligation to provide any

welfare benefits except as required by the applicable requirements of Section

authoritative and binding guidance thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has any (i) liability for withholding taxes or
penalties due under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (other than liability
that may arise from the obligation to withhold taxes generally in accordance
with applicable law) or (ii) indemnity obligation for any Taxes imposed under
Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(h) The Company and its Affiliates are and have been in compliance
with the Affordable Care Act to the extent required. The Company and its
Affiliates have made an offer of affordable minimum essential coverage to
their respective employees in the manner contemplated under Section 4980H of
the Code to the extent required to avoid the adverse tax consequences
thereunder, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is otherwise
liable or responsible for any assessable payment, taxes or other penalties
under Section 4980H of the Code or otherwise under the Affordable Care Act or
in connection with requirements relating thereto.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ , neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger will, individually or together with the occurrence
of any other event: (i) entitle any employee, trustee, director or consultant
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay under any Company Employee Benefit Plan or Company employment
agreement upon any termination of employment on or after the date of this
Agreement, and the maximum amount of such severance pay as to which such
individual could be entitled is set forth on _Section 3.14(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_ ; (ii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or
funding or result in any payment of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount or value of any payment to any employee, officer, trustee

related trust; (iii) result in payments or benefits under any Company
Employee Benefit Plan or Company employment agreement which would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code; or (iv) result in a requirement to
pay any tax "gross up" or similar "make whole" payment to any employee,
director, consultant or other service provider of the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates. The Merger constitutes an "Unfavorable Limited Change in
Control" as such term is defined in the employment agreements set forth on
_Section 3.14(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ and/or each award agreement
with respect to all Company RSUs, and as a result, each Company RSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall, at the
Merger Effective Time, be forfeited and no payment or other consideration
shall be made with respect thereto.

ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT PARTIES

  



  

The following representations and warranties by the Parent and the Parent
Operating Partnership are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
disclosures (a) in the Parent SEC Documents (excluding any disclosures under
the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" or any other
disclosures contained therein to the extent they are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature) filed with, or furnished to, the SEC on or after
January 1, 2017 and at least five (5) business days prior to the date hereof
(and then only to the extent that the relevance of any disclosed event, item
or occurrence in such Parent SEC Documents to a matter covered by a
representation or warranty set forth in this _Article IV_ is reasonably
apparent on its face as to matters and items that are the subject of such
representations or warranty), and (b) set forth in Parent's disclosure
letter delivered to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"). Each disclosure set forth in the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall qualify the Section to which it corresponds and
any other Section to the extent the applicability of the subject disclosure
to such other Section is reasonably apparent on its face from the text of the
disclosure made (it being acknowledged that if the applicability of such
disclosure to such other Section is so reasonably apparent then it is not
required that the other Sections be cross-referenced to such disclosure);
provided that nothing in the Parent Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden
the scope of any representation or warranty of the Parent Parties made
herein. The following representations are made by Parent and the Parent
Operating Partnership on a joint and several basis.

  



  

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Parent
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Maryland and has the requisite organizational
power and authority and any necessary governmental authorization to own,
lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly qualified or
licensed to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Parent Subsidiary is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as
the case may be, and has the requisite organizational power and authority and
any necessary governmental authorization to own, lease and, to the extent
applicable, operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in
good standing that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

preemptive rights. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other

the value of any equity security of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
or obligating Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
commitment, agreement, right of first refusal, arrangement or undertaking.
Except for 3,214,561 outstanding "LTIP Units" (as defined in the Parent
Operating Partnership Agreement), there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of Parent Common Stock, shares of Parent

Section 4.6 _Permits; Compliance with Law_.

  



  

(a) Except for the authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates,

being conducted as of the date hereof (the "Parent Permits"), except in each
case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All such Parent Permits are valid
and in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in possession
of, or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the

Parent Permits (except for the Parent Permits addressed in _Section 4.15_ ,
which are addressed solely in that Section), except in each case for any such
conflicts, defaults or violations that have been cured or, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no
investigation, review or proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect
to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or their properties or operations is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no Governmental Authority has indicated an intention to
conduct the same.

respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC

furnished (or effectiveness in the case of registration statements),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement and provided that no
representation or warranty is made hereunder as to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 that were not supplied by or on
behalf of the Parent Parties. As of the date of this Agreement and except as
previously made available to the Company, neither Parent nor the Parent

correct copies of all written correspondence between the SEC on the one

Operating Partnership has complied in all material respects with the

change in Parent's internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parent's
internal control over financial reporting. Parent is not aware of any change
in its internal control over financial reporting that has occurred during its
most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, Parent's internal control over financial
reporting. Since January 1, 2016, (x) Parent has designed and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and

to Parent and required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (y) to Parent's
Knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
Parent to material information relating to Parent required to be included in
the reports Parent is required to file under the Exchange Act, and (z)
Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to Parent's independent registered public accounting firm and the
audit committee of the Parent Board (A) all known significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parent's internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parent's internal controls over financial reporting. As of the date of
this Agreement, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Parent have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and
the statements contained in all such certifications were, as of their
respective dates made, true, complete and correct in all material respects.

not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
there are no liabilities of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries of a
nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth on the financial

constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or provision of (a)
(i) the Parent Charter or the Parent Bylaws, (ii) the comparable charter or
organizational documents of the Parent Operating Partnership or (iii) the
comparable charter or organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiary, or

to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets is bound

_Section 5.3(c)_ , _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.3(g)_ , and except as
provided below in respect of any Window Period Bidder, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Merger Effective Time and the date, if any, on which

of requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations
hereunder or fail to consummate the Merger (each, a "Company Alternative

foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, during the
period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59
p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is thirty (30) days following the
date of this Agreement (the "Window Period End Time"), any of the Company,

respective Representatives receives any written, unsolicited and bona fide
inquiry, proposal or, offer or other contact from a third party (including
any Affiliates of such Person and joint venture partners of such Person in
connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal, each a "Window Period
Bidder") that the Company Board determines, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be

to _Section 5.3(a)_ , at any time prior to the Window Period End Time, the
Company, the Company Operating Partnership, the other Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives (on their behalf) may, and shall have the

their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Window Period Bidder with respect to
any Company Superior Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.3(b)_
shall preclude the Company, the Company Operating Partnership, the other
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives from contacting any
such Person solely for the purpose of complying with the immediately preceding
sentence.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in
this _Section 5.3_ , if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) the Company or the Company Operating Partnership receives a
written Company Acquisition Proposal (including any Company
Acquisition Proposal previously received from any Window Period Bidder) that
the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Company
Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a violation of _Section 5.3(a)_ (
_provided_ , that the Parties agree that the Company and the Company Board
may correspond with a third party making any such Company Acquisition Proposal
to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal), and (iii) the
Company Board determines (or, with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal from any Window Period Bidder, has previously determined and not
rescinded such determination) in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior
Proposal, then the Company and the Company Operating Partnership may (and may
authorize the other Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives to) (x)
furnish non-public information with respect to the Company, the Company
Operating Partnership and the other Company Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to any Person shall have previously been provided to
Parent or shall be provided (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to
Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person,
and (y) engage in discussions and participate in negotiations with the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and such Person's Representatives)
regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Except as expressly provided in _Section 5.3(e)_ , the Company
Board (i) (A) shall not fail to make and shall not withdraw (or modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to withdraw,
modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent) the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and (B) shall not
adopt, approve, or publicly recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable
the adoption of any Company Acquisition Proposal (each such action set forth
in this _Section 5.3(d)(i)_ being referred to herein as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change"), and (ii) shall not cause or permit the Company, the
Company Operating Partnership or any of the other Company Subsidiaries to
enter into any Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to any
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(c)_ ).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and may
thereafter and following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ cause or permit the Company, the Company Operating Partnership
or any of the other Company Subsidiaries to enter into any Company
Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal),
if (A) the Company Parties have not violated _Section 5.3(a)_ , _Section
5.3(b)_ or _Section 5.3(c)_ and (B) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors)
that the applicable Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not from a
Window Period Bidder) constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; and (ii)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, in the absence of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (A) a Company Intervening Event has occurred, and (B)
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors) that the failure to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable Law; so long as, in each case ((i) and
(ii)), (x) four business days prior to making any such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company has notified Parent in writing that the
Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with a Company Superior Proposal or a Company Intervening Event (a
"Company Change Notice") and which Company Change Notice shall specify, in a
case where such Company Change Notice relates to a Company Superior Proposal,
the identity of the party who made such Company Superior Proposal and all of
the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and
attach a copy of the most current version of the related Company Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, and, in a case where such Company Change Notice
relates to a Company Intervening Event, a description of such Company
Intervening Event, and (y) during the four business day period beginning on
the date of delivery of the applicable Company Change Notice to Parent, the
Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in
good faith with) Parent (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) in
making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that (1)
in circumstances involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Superior Proposal ceases to be a Company Superior Proposal (provided
that any amendment, supplement or modification to any Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed a new Company Acquisition Proposal and the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ or make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this
_Section 5.3(e)_ unless the Company has again complied with the requirements
of this _Section 5.3(e)_  with respect to each such new Company Acquisition
Proposal including sending a Company Change Notice with respect to each
such new Company Acquisition Proposal (except that the new negotiation period
under this _Section 5.3(e)(y)(1)_ with respect to any revised Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be two business days, instead of four business
days)), and (2) in circumstances not involving a Company Acquisition
Proposal, as may be proposed by Parent.

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than one (1) Business Day) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt by the
Company, the Company Operating Partnership, any other Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective Representatives of, the making of, or the intent to
make, any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, by any Person or group of related Persons in
connection with the making of, or intent to make, a Company Acquisition
Proposal. Such notification shall include, to the extent then known and
unless prohibited by the terms of any confidentiality agreement between the
Company and such Person entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, the
identity of the parties and a copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal, or,
if not made in writing, a written description of the material terms thereof.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably apprised, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status and material terms, including any material or proposed
developments with respect to discussions and negotiations concerning any such
Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to the preceding three sentences, nothing herein
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Operating Partnership, the other
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from contacting any
Person submitting a Company Acquisition Proposal (that was not the result of
a violation of this _Section 5.3_ ) solely to clarify the terms of the
Company Acquisition Proposal for the sole purpose of the Company Board
informing itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the
Company or the Company Board through its Representatives, directly or
indirectly, from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to
be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary
to complete the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital
stock to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Form S-4 and Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement,
and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the
other with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from
the SEC and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement,

practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response). Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use reasonable best
efforts to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required
by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent.
Nothing in this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party
under _Section 5.4(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.4(b)_ , any
information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or the
Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates
will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

  



  

(c) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents, establish a record
date and meeting date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, and shall, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. The
Company shall not change the record date or meeting date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors,
recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have
made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 5.3_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.4(c)_ , if, on a
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Parent may require the Company, and the Company shall have
the right, to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting to a date
determined in consultation with Parent ( _provided_ , that the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Stockholder
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law)); _provided_ , _however_ , the Company Stockholder
Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Company Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled if the Company shall have received proxies in respect of
an aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock, which have not been
withdrawn, such that the Company Stockholder Approval will be obtained at
such meeting.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  



  

Section 6.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and Contracts, and subject to the reasonable protocols imposed from time
to time upon advice of counsel, each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively, to afford to the other Party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all
of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish all information in its possession
(financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel
such other Party or its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
that no such disclosure or investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall
affect, or be deemed to modify, any of the representations or warranties made
by any of the Parties hereunder and all such access shall be coordinated
through designated Representatives of Parent or the Company, as applicable,
in accordance with reasonable procedures as they may establish.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall be
required by this _Section 6.1(a)_ to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of the other Party with access to or to disclose information,
(i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into
after the date of this Agreement in the Ordinary Course of Business (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such
access or disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law,
contractual obligation or duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that withholding
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of
any Law or duty or to obtain the consent of the third party to whom the
contractual duty is owed) or (iii) that is subject to any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege). Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that
may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior
to the Merger Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall not, and
shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with parties with which the other Party has a business
relationship (including tenants/subtenants) regarding the business of
such other Party or this Agreement and the Transactions without the prior
written consent of the other Party (provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.1(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict a Party
and its respective Representatives and Affiliates from contacting such third
parties in pursuing its own business activities (operating in the ordinary
course)).

give prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other
communication received by such Party (A) from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, or (B)
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person)
is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions
or (C) of any written notice received from any Person in connection with (1)
any material violation or default under or notice to terminate, not renew or
challenge the validity or enforceability of any Company Material Contract or
Company Lease, or (2) any event or circumstance that would give rise to any
option to purchase, right of first refusal or first offer, or any other right
to purchase in favor of any Person under any Company Material Contract or
Company Lease, (ii) of any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Party's
Knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case arising from or otherwise
relating to the Merger or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware
of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event, change, development
or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which makes or is reasonably likely to
make any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to not be
satisfied. The failure to deliver any such notice, in and of itself, shall
not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any Contract to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other

conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the
preparing and filing of all documentation to effect all required filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions and applications
and the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,
authorizations and approvals from Governmental Entities or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid Legal Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions, (iii) the defending of any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the

impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause to be given) any notices to
any Person, and each of Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each of
their respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents from any Person not covered by _Section 6.2(a)_ that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the Parties will
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other
Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations
or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
either Party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement.
To the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their Representatives
shall have the right to review in advance and each of the Parties will
consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of
their Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and
the other Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive
business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent
reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they
permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any
meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without
giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Party the
opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in
any such meeting with such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any Person pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(b)_ shall not be a condition to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the Merger, except as described in _Section 7.2(e)_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger, none of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or commit to
pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation to such Person, in each case that is not
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect to reasonable
accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that no approval or consent of any such
Person is a condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger,
except as described in _Section 7.2(e)_.

respective reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries
to take all actions and do all things to) obtain all approvals, consents,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained pursuant to
the terms of the agreements set forth on _Section 4.5(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter_  in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions.

concurrent with or prior to Closing.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release, and thereafter, except
with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken
by the Company or the Company Board in accordance with _Section 5.3_ , Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and, to the
extent practicable, give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, duties under applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with the NYSE.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance and
Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of the Company
Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law, under the Company Governing Documents in effect on the
date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar agreements in
effect on the date hereof and disclosed in _Section 6.4(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ (the "Indemnification Agreements"), to each of the Covered
Persons who are covered by such Company Governing Documents, Company
Subsidiary Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements arising out of
or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Merger Effective Time, including in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the Transactions. Parent agrees to maintain in
effect the rights to indemnification or exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Merger Effective Time equivalent to the
provisions now existing in favor of any such Covered Person in any Company
Governing Document, Company Subsidiary Governing Document or Indemnification
Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or modify such rights in a manner
adverse to a Covered Person for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date; _provided_ that, if at any time prior to the six-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, any Covered Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting that indemnification is required pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ with respect to a Claim, then the provisions for indemnification
under this _Section 6.4_ with respect to such Claim shall survive the six-
year anniversary of the Closing Date and shall continue to apply until such
time as such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

  



    

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ , for a
period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (but, in each
instance for which indemnification is sought, only if such Covered Person
would be entitled to indemnification by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
under the Indemnification Agreements, the Company Governing Documents or the
Company Subsidiary Governing Documents): (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is on the date hereof, or was previously, or is at any time from
the date hereof until the Merger Effective Time, serving as a manager,
director, officer, trustee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and acting in such capacity (collectively, the "Covered Persons")
against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect thereof) in
connection with any Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of, or advance to,
each Covered Person in advance of the final disposition of any such Claim,
all Claim Expenses (including attorneys' fees and any Claims
Expenses incurred in enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification or advancement) of any Covered Person incurred in
connection with defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating with respect to such Claim, in each case, without the posting
of any surety or bond, but subject to the receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Covered Person to repay such Claim Expenses if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, any Covered
Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting that indemnification is
required in accordance with this _Section 6.4_ with respect to a Claim, then
the provisions for indemnification contained in this _Section 6.4_ with
respect to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Merger
Effective Time and shall continue to apply until such time as such Claim is
fully and finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity (1) shall be
liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent, and
(2) shall have any obligation hereunder to any Covered Person to the extent
that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-
appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in
which case the Covered Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the
Surviving Entity the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant
hereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in, or seek termination with respect to,
any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification may be
sought by a Covered Person hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment includes an unconditional release of such Covered Persons from all
liability arising out of such Claim.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided,_ that the Company may substitute therefor policies written by
carriers with A.M. Best ratings no lower than the existing policies, providing
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (such 300% amount, the "Base Premium"); _provided_ , 
_further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only
be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Base Premium; _provided_ ,
_further_ , if the Company in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of
the foregoing insurance, effective as of the Merger Effective Time, the
Company may purchase a directors' and officers' liability insurance "tail" or
"runoff" insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the Merger
Effective Time, if such insurance can be obtained for an annual premium equal
to the Base Premium with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof.

  



  

(d) If any of Parent or the Surviving Entity, or any of the
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges with or
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
winds-up, or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.4_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person and
other Person referred to in this _Section 6.4_ (who are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_ ), his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Entity, and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to any Covered Person (including his or her successors, assigns and
heirs) without the prior written consent of the applicable Covered Person
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The
exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section 6.4_ shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or exculpation which a Covered Person and other Person referred to in this
_Section 6.4_ is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or
otherwise.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties and their respective
boards of directors (or equivalent) shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is
or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and (b)
if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing,
to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute or Section 5.02 of the Parent Charter or Section 7.2 of the
Company Charter (collectively the "Charter Restrictions") on the Merger and
the other Transactions. No Party shall take any action to exempt any Person
(other than the other Parties or their respective Affiliates) from any
Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction or the Charter Restrictions that may
purport to be applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions or
otherwise cause any restrictions in any Takeover Statute or the Charter
Restrictions not to apply to any such Person, except in connection with the
concurrent termination of this Agreement and entry into a Company Alternative
Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a Company Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_.

Section 6.6 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity

equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company,
or who will become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting
any Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties
understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
Company's or any Company Subsidiary's operations prior to the Merger Effective
Time, and (b) prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

Proceeding and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in the
defense and settlement of any such Legal Proceeding against the
Company and/or its directors by security holders of the Company, and no
settlement thereof shall be agreed to without Parent's written consent.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent
resignations executed by each director of the Company and its wholly owned
Subsidiaries in office immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time,

Section 6.11 _Dividends_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, neither the Company nor Parent shall
make, declare or set aside any dividend or other distribution to its
respective stockholders without the prior written consent of the Company (in
the case of Parent) or Parent (in the case of the Company); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the written consent of the other Party shall not be required
for the authorization and payment of the Company Permitted Dividends or the
Parent Permitted Dividends, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
any other restriction on dividends and other distributions in this Agreement,
including the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.1(b)(iii)_ and
_Section 5.2(b)(iii)_ , each of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent
and any Parent Subsidiary shall be permitted (without the consent of the
other Party) to declare and make dividends and distributions, including under
Sections 858 or 860 of the Code, prior to the Closing if the making of such
dividends or distributions prior to the Closing is necessary for the Company
or Parent, as applicable, to maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or
applicable state Law and avoid the imposition of any entity level income or
excise Tax under the Code or applicable state Law (each, a "REIT Dividend");
_provided_ , that if either Party determines that it is necessary to declare
a REIT Dividend, then it shall notify the other Party at least 20 days prior
to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting and such other Party shall be
entitled to declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of Parent,
to holders of Parent Common Stock, in an amount per share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the REIT Dividend
declared by the Company with respect to each share of Company Common Stock by
(B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case of the Company, to holders of
Company Common Stock, in an amount per share of Company Common Stock equal to
the product of (x) the REIT Dividend declared by the Parent with respect to
each share of Parent Common Stock and (y) the Exchange Ratio. The record date
and payment date for any dividend payable pursuant to this _Section
6.11(a)_ shall be the close of business on the last business day prior to the
Closing Date; and

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall coordinate with each other the payment of dividends with
respect to their respective common stock and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that holders of
Parent Common Stock and the Company Common Stock shall not receive two (2)
dividends, or fail to receive one (1) dividend, for any single calendar
quarter with respect to their shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock or any shares of the Parent Common Stock that any such holder receives
in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger.

  



  

(c) In the event that a distribution with respect to the Company
Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (a) a record
date prior to the Merger Effective Time and (b) has not been paid as of the
Merger Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive such distribution from the Company as of immediately prior
to the time such shares are exchanged pursuant to _Article II_.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it, the Parent Operating
Partnership or any of the Parent Subsidiaries as of the record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting, if any, in favor of approval of the Merger.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) From the Closing Date and until the first anniversary thereof,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity, or the applicable Parent
Subsidiaries, to provide each person who was an employee of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and
continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Parent
Subsidiary after the Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee") with (i) a
base salary (or hourly wage) that is not less than the base salary (or hourly
wage), (ii) additional aggregate cash compensation commensurate with the
total compensation, equal to the aggregate annual compensation (not
including any equity or equity-based compensation) of such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iii) other employee benefits
(other than any equity awards) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to such benefits, in each case, as those provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



    

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent agrees that it will, or will cause a Parent Subsidiary or
the Surviving Entity to, from and after the Merger Effective Time, assume and
agree to perform the employment agreements and retention agreements listed in
_Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ and honor all Company
Employee Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any Company Employee
Benefit Plan or any other individual employee benefit plan, program, Contract
or policy (in accordance with the amendment or termination provisions
thereof) or as requiring Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or the Surviving Entity
to continue or to offer to continue the employment or engagement of any
employee or independent contractor or any written employment contract.

  



  

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan in which a Company
Employee becomes a participant, Parent shall, and shall cause the
applicable Parent Subsidiary or the Surviving Entity to, (i) fully credit
each participating Company Employee for eligibility and vesting purposes
under such employee benefit plan for such Company Employee's service with the
Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that no such service credit need be given where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
fully credit each participating Company Employee for any coinsurance,
copayments and deductibles paid and for amounts paid toward any out-of-pocket
maximums prior to the date the Company Employee becomes a participant in such
employee benefit plan with respect to the calendar year in which such
participation commences, and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Company Employees.

  



  

(d) Within five (5) business days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall pay or cause a Parent Subsidiary or the Surviving Entity to pay to each
Company Employee listed in _Section 6.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter_
such employee's 2018 annual bonuses as reflected on such schedule (less
applicable tax withholdings) to the extent that such 2018 annual bonuses have
not been paid before the Closing Date; provided, however, that payments made
pursuant to this _Section 6.13(d)_ would not violate any provision of the
applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan or of Section 409A of the Code and
other authoritative and binding guidance thereunder.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as an amendment
or other modification of any Company Employee Benefit Plan or Parent
Employee Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement or the establishment of any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment
for any employee of the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or to
restrict the right of the Surviving Entity, Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries to terminate or cause to be terminated the employment of any
employee at any time for any or no reason with or without notice, or to
modify the terms and conditions of employment. Parent and the Company
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.13_
are included for the sole benefit of Parent, the Surviving Entity, the
Company, the Company Operating Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries,
and that nothing in this _Section 6.13_ , whether express or implied, shall
create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other Person,
including any employees, former employees, any participant in any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or (B) to continued employment with Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Entity, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
continued participation in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Parent provides a notice of termination and such termination could result in
the obligation to pay the Termination Payment, the right to receive such
Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Related Parties against the Company Related Parties or Parent Related Parties,
as applicable, for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise;  _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the rights of
Parent or the Parent Operating Partnership, if any, to obtain injunctive
relief and/or specific performance pursuant to _Section 9.14_ prior to any
termination of this Agreement. Upon payment of the Termination Payment, none
of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except with respect to any
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt,
if a Party has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to multiple
provisions of this Agreement, such Party may elect under which provision it is
providing notice of termination.

  



  

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the recipient in the circumstances in
which the Termination Payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Legal Proceeding. Each of the
Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Legal Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
