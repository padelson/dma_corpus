Parent and required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to Parent&rsquo;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (y) to Parent&rsquo;s Knowledge,
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Parent to material information relating to Parent required to be included in the reports Parent is required to file
under the Exchange Act, and (z) Parent&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to
