Section 2.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time (as defined below), Merger Corp shall be merged with and into the
Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Corp will cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 2.02 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in New York City at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New

to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ (except for any conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such
conditions or waiver by the Party entitled to waive such conditions), unless
another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

Section 2.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed and acknowledged in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

 



18 Section 2.04 _Effects of the Merger_.

 

(a) At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the property, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Corp and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Corp, all
as provided under the DGCL.

Section 2.05 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger
Corp_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Corp:

 

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) or
Merger Corp immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.05(a)_, and (ii) subject to the provisions of _Section 2.08_,
Appraisal Shares) shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right to
receive (x) $49.00 in cash, without interest (the "Per Share Cash Amount"),
and (y) 0.0777 (such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.06_,
the "Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of Parent Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock Amount") (and, if applicable,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance
with _Section 2.07_) (the consideration payable in accordance with this 
_Section 2.05(b)_, the "Merger Consideration") less any withholding in
accordance with Section 2.09(i).

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (1) a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Stock (a "Certificate") or (2) shares of Company Stock held in book-
entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except (subject to _Section 2.08_) (A) the Merger Consideration and
(B) the right to receive any other amounts expressly provided herein, without
interest, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section
2.09_.

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Corp issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.06 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time or (ii) any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article 10_ , the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or

 



19  a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the
Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company
Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Stock) the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing
in this _Section 2.06_ shall be construed to permit any Party to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of
this Agreement.

Section 2.07 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Stock pursuant to _Section 2.05_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or
to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All
fractional shares to which a single record holder of Company Stock would be
otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of Company Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional
shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down
to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional
share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would,
but for this _Section 2.07_, be entitled under _Section 2.05(b)_ and (B) an
amount equal to the average of the volume weighted average price per share of
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent
and the Company) on each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending with
the complete trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of Company Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts,
without interest, to the holders of Company Stock entitled to receive such
cash.

 

Section 2.08 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("Appraisal Shares")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
("Section 262") shall not be converted into the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.05_, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall
be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.05_. The Company shall provide
prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the Company. Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



20 Section 2.09 _Exchange of Company Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), and
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Stock, for exchange in accordance with this  _Article 2_ , through
the Exchange Agent, subject to _Section 2.09(b)(ii)_, book-entry shares (or
certificates if requested) representing the full number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to  _Section 2.05_ in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash in an
aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange
Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.09(c)_ which had not theretofore been
surrendered for exchange or been exchanged pursuant to _Section 2.09(b)(ii)_
(such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). For the purposes of such
deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for
addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to
pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.07_. The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant
to _Section 2.05_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in _Section
2.09(h)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.05_, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof
as promptly as practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash
Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to _Section_
_2.05(b)_

 



21  (after taking into account all other Certificates surrendered by such holder
pursuant to this _Section 2.09(b)(i)_), (C) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to  _Section 2.09(c)(i)_ and (D) cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.07_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be
issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05_ shall automatically
upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by
such Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.05(b)_ (after taking into account all other Book-Entry Shares
converted by such holder pursuant to this _Section 2.09(b)(ii)_), (C) any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.09(c)(ii)_ and (D)
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.07_, and
the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry
Shares.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Stock, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to _Section 2.07_, until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with this _Article 2_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time
of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.09(b)(i)_ ,

 



22  the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.09(b)(i)_, and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such
Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.09(b)(i)_,
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article 2_ , without interest, (A) at
the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.09(b)(ii)_, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such delivery by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.09(b)(ii)_, and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to 
_Section 2.09(b)(ii)_, payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article 2_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Stock (other than the right to receive dividends or other distributions, if
any, in accordance with _Section 2.09(c)_). After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for nine months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock as contemplated by  _Section 2.09(c)_.

(f) None of Parent, Merger Corp, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



23 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.09(c)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
been surrendered as provided in this _Article 2_.

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income
or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this _Article 2_.
If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Company Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.09(i)_ and
paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority shall be treated as having been
paid to the holder of Company Stock in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts
so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period
required under applicable Law.

 

Section 2.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Corp acquired or to
be

 



24  acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 2.11 _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each compensatory option to purchase shares of
Company Stock (a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted at
the Effective Time into an option (each, an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient
(rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing the Per Share Cash
Amount by the volume weighted average price of the Parent Common Stock for
the five consecutive trading days ending with, and including, the trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (such sum, the "Stock Award Exchange
Ratio"), with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole
number of shares. The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject
to any such Adjusted Option will be an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Stock
Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher
number of whole cents. The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
subject to any such Adjusted Option and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to any such Adjusted Option will be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case
of Company Stock Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

 

(b) _Unvested Company RSUs_. Each compensatory restricted stock unit with
respect to shares of Company Stock that is subject solely to a time-based
vesting condition (a "Company RSU") and is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time and does not vest by its terms at the
Effective Time (an "Unvested Company RSU") shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit (each, an "Adjusted RSU") with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Unvested Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded to the next whole number of shares. The term "Unvested Company RSU"
shall include those restricted stock unit awards granted to officers of the
Company on August 15, 2014 that have a performance condition relating to the
Companys fiscal year, which goal will be certified as achieved by the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board prior to the Closing Date.

 



25 (c) _Unvested Company PSUs_. Each compensatory performance stock unit with
respect to shares of Company Stock that is subject to both time-based and
performance-based vesting conditions (a "Company PSU") and is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time and does not vest by its
terms at the Effective Time (an "Unvested Company PSU") shall be converted
into a restricted stock unit (each, an "Adjusted PSU") with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Unvested Company PSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except that the performance-based vesting
conditions applicable to such Unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time), and
relating to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company
PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the next whole number
of shares; _provided_ , that for this purpose, the number of shares subject to
each Unvested Company PSU that is subject to a performance condition for which
the performance period is greater than one year shall be the number of shares
of Company Stock earned based on the level of achievement of such performance
condition measured, in a manner that is consistent with the Companys past
practice regarding the methodology for such measurement, through the end of
the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the
Closing Date occurs (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board prior to the Closing Date), but shall not be less than the
target number of shares of Company Stock. Any accrued but unpaid dividend
equivalents with respect to any Unvested Company PSU will be assumed and
become an obligation with respect to the applicable Adjusted PSU.

 

(d) _Vested Company RSUs; Vested Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each
Company RSU and each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and becomes vested by its terms at the Effective Time (a
"Vested Company RSU"), shall be cancelled and converted into, with respect to
each share of Company Stock underlying such Company RSU or Company PSU
(provided, that, each such Company PSU shall, in accordance with its terms,
vest based on the greater of target performance and actual performance through
the Closing Date as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board prior to the Closing Date), (A) the Merger Consideration on the
same terms and conditions as other shares of Company Stock, subject to
applicable tax withholdings, with such tax withholding to be withheld pro rata
from the Per Share Cash Amount and the Per Share Stock Amount (with the Per
Share Stock Amount valued, for such purpose, based on the closing price of
Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date), and (B) the right to receive any
dividends or distributions accumulated pursuant to the terms of such Company
RSU or Company PSU that have not been paid prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable tax withholdings. The Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this _Section 2.11(d)_ and any accumulated dividends, other than
those that are deferred under the Company Deferred Compensation Plan which
shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such plan, shall be paid as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time. Section 2.07 shall apply in
respect of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.11(d)
_mutatis mutandis_. Any Company RSU held by a member of the Company
Board, the settlement of which was elected to be deferred, shall be treated
as a Vested Company RSU.

(e) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary for the conversion of the Company Stock Options,
Unvested Company

 



26  RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs pursuant to this _Section 2.11_, including
the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary
to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.11_. Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate
form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously
filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the Adjusted Options, Adjusted RSUs and Adjusted PSUs. With respect
to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be
subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act,
where applicable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to administer
any Adjusted Option, Adjusted RSU and Adjusted PSU in a manner that complies
with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the extent such Adjusted
Option, Adjusted RSU or Adjusted PSU complied with such rule prior to the
Merger.

(f) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take such actions with respect to the Companys
equity compensation plans or arrangements as are necessary to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.11_ and (ii) satisfy all
applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the 1934 Act.

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the
Company has all corporate, limited liability company or comparable powers and
all Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those powers or Governmental Authorizations the absence
of which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification 

 



30  is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so
qualified has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of or
other ownership interests in each Subsidiary of the Company, are owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any

securities or other ownership interests), in each case other than (x)
statutory or other liens for Taxes or assessments which are not yet due or
delinquent or the validity of which is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves are being maintained,
(y) transfer and other restrictions under applicable federal and state
securities Laws and (z) in the case of Subsidiaries that are immaterial to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immaterial Liens. _Section

shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights,
"phantom" stock or similar securities or rights issued or granted by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are derivative of, or provide
economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any
capital stock or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in
any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being

the Company since July 1, 2011 (collectively, together with any exhibits and
schedules thereto and other information incorporated therein, the "Company SEC
Documents").

 

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-

may be. 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Company

 



31  SEC Document filed or furnished pursuant to the 1934 Act did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any
material respect.

is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being
prepared, and such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure all such information is communicated in a timely fashion to the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow
timely decisions regarding the disclosure of such information in the
Companys periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal

the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i)

the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications
are complete and correct in all material respects.

(k) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, there has been no transaction, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings,
nor is there any proposed transaction as of the date of this Agreement, or

Section 5.08 _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or

are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.08_, no

 



53  representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to information or
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus which were not supplied by or on behalf of the

Section 5.09 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and
complete fully executed copies of (i) the commitment letter, dated as of
October 5, 2014, among Parent, Goldman Sachs Banks USA and Goldman Sachs
Lending Partners (the "Commitment Letter") and (ii) the fee letter, among
Parent, Goldman Sachs Banks USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners, dated as
of October 5, 2014 (as redacted to remove the fee amounts, pricing caps, the
rates and amounts included in the "market flex" and other economic terms that
could not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or
aggregate principal amount of the Financing, the "Redacted Fee Letter"), in
each case, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such
letters in effect as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Debt
Letters"), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof
each of the parties thereto (other than Parent) have severally committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent (the provision of such funds as
set forth therein, but subject to the provisions of _Section 8.04_, the
"Financing") for the purposes set forth in such Debt Letters. The
Debt Letters have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the respective
commitments contained in the Debt Letters have not been withdrawn, rescinded,
amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement. As of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Debt Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to the knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject in each case to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
generally the enforcement of creditors rights and subject to general
principles of equity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing pursuant to the Debt Letters, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Letters and, after the date of this Agreement, such
other conditions and contingencies with respect to the Financing permitted
pursuant to _Section 8.04_. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt
Letters, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together with
other financial resources of Parent, including contemplated cash on hand of
Parent, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection therewith. As of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under the Debt
Letters or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Debt Letters
(assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties
and undertakings under this Agreement for such purpose). As of the of this
Agreement there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or
arrangements related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other
than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters. Parent has fully paid all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and
the performance of all obligations and compliance with all covenants and
agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with at or
prior to the Closing by the Company in all material respects, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement,
that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date
in accordance with the terms of the Debt Letters.

Section 6.02 _Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the 1933 Act (except as
provided in this _Section 6.02_) for the purpose of voting on the approval
and adoption of this Agreement in accordance with DGCL. In connection with the
Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall (i) subject to _Section
8.03(b)_, recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by the Companys stockholders in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting. Subject to _Section 8.03(b)_, the Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all other actions reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the adoption of this agreement by
the Companys stockholders. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub
reasonably updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall have the right to adjourn
or postpone the Company Stockholder meeting (i) after consultation with
Parent, for a single period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days if on the
date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Company Common Stock to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval; (ii) if on the date on which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting; or (iii) after
consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
Applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be timely provided to the holders of Company
Common Stock. Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Companys
organizational documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) and compensation matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be the only matters (other than matters of procedure
and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the
Companys stockholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting. Regardless 

 



60  of whether there is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall be held in accordance with the terms hereof unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 10_.

Section 7.01 _Conduct of Parent_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as set
forth in _Section 7.01_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as consented to in
writing by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or as required by applicable Law or Order,
Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its
business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and, to the
extent consistent with the foregoing, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) preserve intact its business organization and (ii) maintain generally
its business relationships with its customers, lenders, suppliers and others

Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
or as required by applicable Law or Order, Parent shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

 

(a) amend the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent in a manner
that would have a material and adverse impact on the value of Parent Common
Stock; _provided_ , that any amendment to its certificate of incorporation to
increase the authorized number of shares of any class or series of the capital
stock of Parent shall in no way be restricted by the foregoing;

restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization, or resolutions
providing for or authorizing such a liquidation, dissolution, restructuring,
recapitalization or other reorganization of Parent;

(d) authorize or pay any dividends on or make any distribution with respect to
its outstanding shares (whether in cash, assets, stock or other securities of
Parent or its Subsidiaries), except (i) regular quarterly cash dividends by
Parent at a rate not in excess of $0.545 per share of Parent Common Stock

(including the Merger), issue, deliver or sell, or authorize the issuance,
delivery or sale of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of 20%
of the number of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of the date of
this Agreement, other than the issuance of any shares of Parent Common Stock
upon the exercise of Parent Stock Options or Parent SARs or the settlement of
Parent RSUs or Parent PSUs that are outstanding on the date of this Agreement
in accordance with the applicable terms thereof on the date of this Agreement
or that are issued or granted after the date of this Agreement; or

 

(f) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 7.02 _Obligations of Merger Corp_. Parent shall cause Merger Corp to
perform when due its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 7.03  _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Corp_. Immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties hereto,
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Corp, shall adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger, in accordance with DGCL, by written consent.

Section 7.04 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each former and
present director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and each
person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, together with
such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a "Company Indemnified
Party"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any Proceeding
or investigation with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in
any agreement, a true and complete copy of which agreement has been provided
by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to be maintained in effect
the provisions in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws and comparable
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of
the Company (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the
Surviving Corporation) regarding exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
agreement, a complete copy of

 



62  which agreement has been provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
in each case in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws set forth in Exhibit A
and Exhibit B in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a Company
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (each, an " _Action_ ") pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim.

(b) For a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of the
foregoing) each Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Company Indemnified Party),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action arising out
of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director
or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action; _provided_ that Parent shall only be required to indemnify and
hold harmless, or advance expenses to, a Company Indemnified Party if and to
the same extent such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant
to (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company or (ii) any indemnification agreement between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and such Company Indemnified Party. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party in
the defense of such Action.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for a
period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time the Companys
directors and officers insurance policies (the "DandO Insurance") in place as
of the date of this Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance for
such six (6)-year period from a carrier with comparable or better credit
ratings to the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies,
in each case, with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Companys
existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per
annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth
in _Section 7.04(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Premium Cap");
and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such

 



63  insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding the Premium Cap. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail policy" for a period of no more
than six (6) years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who
are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured
individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent
shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
7.04(b)_; _provided_ , that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not
exceed the Premium Cap. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a
"tail policy," the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to) maintain
such "tail policy" in full force and effect and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such Party set
forth in this _Section 7.04_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured person hereunder (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract, at
Law or otherwise.

Section 7.05 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as part of the
Merger Consideration to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.06 _Employee Matters_. (a) Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately
following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), with, to the
extent employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (i) during the period beginning
at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016 (or, if earlier, the
date of the Continuing Employees termination of employment), base pay that
is at least equal to the base pay provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) with respect to commission and
cash bonus opportunities, as applicable, (A) during the period beginning at
the Effective Time and ending on June 30, 2015 (or, if earlier, the date of
the Continuing Employees termination of employment), opportunities that are
no less favorable than the opportunities provided to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, with such bonuses to be
determined as set forth on _Section 7.06(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and (B) with respect to performance periods from and after July 1,
2015 and 

 



64  ending on December 31, 2016 (or, if earlier, the date of the Continuing
Employees termination of employment), opportunities that are no less
favorable than the opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (it being agreed and understood that such
opportunities for the Continuing Employees with respect to Parents fiscal
year commencing October 1, 2015 will be increased by 25% to take into account
the period from July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015); (iii) during the
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016 (or, if
earlier, the date of the Continuing Employees termination of employment),
long-term incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than the
opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, _provided, however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to the long-term incentive awards granted to the Continuing Employees
at the time that Parent grants long-term incentive awards in the first quarter
of Parents fiscal year commencing October 1, 2015, the aggregate grant
date fair value of all such awards granted to all Continuing Employees who
remain employed at such time as a group shall be no less than 125% of the
aggregate grant date fair value of the long-term incentive awards granted by
the Company to such Continuing Employees as a group in August 2014,
_provided_ , _further_ that the grant date fair value of any such awards shall
be adjusted so as not to result in a duplication of long-term incentive award
opportunities in the event that the Company makes annual grants of long-term
incentive awards between July 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015; and (iv) during
the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016
(or, if earlier, the date of the Continuing Employees termination of
employment), employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that for purposes of
determining whether such opportunities and benefits, in each case, satisfy the
applicable standard set forth above, change in control payments or retention
awards or any similar compensation or benefit awarded by the Company prior to
the Effective Time shall not be taken into account. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2015 (or such longer period as may be required by the terms of
the plan or applicable Law), Parent shall continue to maintain, without
amendment, the Companys severance policies and plans applicable to Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on _Section
7.06(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Company Severance Plans"),
and shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee
whose employment is terminated without "cause", as such term is defined or
concept is used for purposes of the applicable Company Severance Plan, or
under such other circumstances as would entitle a participant to severance
under the applicable Company Severance Plan, during such period (and subject
to the requirements of applicable local Law) with the severance benefits
specified in the applicable Company Severance Plan.

(b) To the extent that Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in
any "employee benefit plan," as defined in _Section 3_(3) of ERISA,
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent
Plans"), then, for purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate,
(ii) vesting, and (iii) benefit accrual (other than for purposes of any (A)
post-retirement medical plan or (B) Parent Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan (the "Parent Retirement Plan") including any supplemental or
restoration defined benefit pension plan (except for the cash balance plan
component of the Parent Retirement Plan and the supplemental or restoration
defined benefit pension plan for which service credit will be provided for
benefit accruals to the extent set forth in the following sentence)) service
with the

 



65  Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary) prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the
extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
For purposes of the Parent Retirement Plan and any supplemental or restoration
defined benefit pension plan, Continuing Employees shall be credited with
prior service calculated as set forth in the prior sentence for purposes of
determining the applicable percentage of the Continuing Employees Pay Credits
(as the term "Pay Credit" is defined in the Parent Retirement Plan and the
supplemental or restoration defined benefit pension plan as applicable to
Cash Balance Members (as defined in the Parent Retirement Plan and the
supplemental or restoration defined benefit pension plan)) with respect to
plan years ending after the Effective Time, but for the avoidance of doubt,
the Continuing Employees Cash Balance Accounts (as the term "Cash Balance
Account" is defined in the Parent Retirement Plan and the supplemental or
restoration defined benefit pension plan as applicable to Cash Balance
Members) shall begin at zero and will not include any accrued benefits for
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary) prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, subject to the terms of the applicable Parent
Plan and applicable Law, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (x) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in
which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time and (y) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Parent Plans that are welfare plans in which such
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

(c) Upon the written request of Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, effective as of immediately prior to Closing Date and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall terminate or
shall cause the termination of any or all U.S. tax-qualified defined
contribution plans provided to current and former employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, to the extent directed by the Parent and in compliance
with applicable Law (each plan so terminated, a "Company Qualified Plan"). In
such event, prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), the
Company and Parent shall take any and all action as may be required, including
amendments to the Parent Savings Incentive Plan (the "Parent Qualified Plan"),
to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) in cash or notes (representing plan loans from the Company Qualified
Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the
account balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company
Qualified Plan to the corresponding Parent Qualified Plan upon receipt of a
favorable IRS determination letter with respect to the termination of such
Company Qualified Plan, _provided, however_ , that the Parent Qualified Plan
will not be required to accept rollovers of Roth contributions that were made
to a Company Qualified Plan pursuant to Section 402A of the Code. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Company Qualified Plan is terminated as described
herein, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible immediately upon the
Closing Date to commence participation in a Parent Qualified Plan.

 



66 (d) No later than thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with copies of all material documents
embodying and relating to each material Foreign Company Plan, including, but
not limited to, the Foreign Company Plan document, all amendments thereto and
all related trust documents, the most recent summary plan description, the
most recent actuarial valuation report, and the most recent tax return filing,
in each case, to the extent applicable.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Continuing Employees who (i) are based outside of the United States,
Parents obligations under this _Section 7.06_ shall be in addition to, but
not in contravention of, any obligations under the Laws of the foreign
countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Continuing Employees are based, and (ii) are covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement, Parents obligations under this _Section 7.06_ shall
(A) be in addition to, but not in contravention of, the terms and conditions
of employment for such Continuing Employees as set forth in such Collective
Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or termination in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law and (B) apply only to the extent
permitted by applicable labor Laws.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.06_, expressed or implied, shall (i)
be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Company
Plan or Parent Plan or constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify,
merge or terminate after the Effective Time any Company Plan or Parent Plan,
(ii) give any current or former employee, director or other independent
contractor of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof), or any labor organization, union, works council, employee
association, trade union, other similar employee representative body,
any third-party beneficiary or other rights or (iii) obligate Parent or any
of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Plan or Parent Plan
or (B) retain the employment or services of any current or former employee,
director or other independent contractor of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE 8

 

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY_

 

Section 8.01 _Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or Order to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as reasonably practicable with any Governmental Authority
or other Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or
advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not such approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations are conditions
to the consummation of the Merger pursuant to _Article 9_ ).

 



67 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement in the case
of the following clause (i) (unless counsel to the Parties have previously
agreed to extend such ten (10) Business Day period)), (i) an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) an appropriate filing
of a Form CO with the European Commission, (iii) all necessary filings to
obtain consents from the state regulators that are required in connection with
the Merger and (iii) all other registrations, declarations, notices and
filings with Governmental Authorities that are required in connection with
the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the
foregoing, and use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods regarding the foregoing as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before
a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (B) promptly
inform the other Party of (and if in writing, supply to the other Party) any
communication (other than any ministerial communications) received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the European Commission, or
any other similar Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(C) consult with each other prior to taking any material position with
respect to the filings under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law in
discussions with or filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority, (D)
permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any
Governmental Authority with respect to filings under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law, and (E) coordinate with the other in preparing and
exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel)
with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any
oral presentations) made by such Party with any Governmental Authority
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under the
HSR Act or any other Competition Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, have control over and lead
all communications and strategy relating to obtaining all approvals, consents,
waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations under
any Competition Law from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party in
connection with consummating the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to any litigation under any Competition Law
arising therefrom; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall consult in
advance with the Company and in good faith take the Companys views into
account regarding the overall strategic direction of any such approval
process, as applicable, and consult with the Company prior to taking any
material substantive positions, making dispositive motions or other material
substantive filings or submissions or entering into any negotiations
concerning such approvals, as applicable. The

 



68  parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section in a manner
so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in
any conversation (other than ministerial conversations) with any Governmental
Authority in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of the
actions referred to in _Section 8.01(a)_) without the other, (ii) to the
extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any
such meeting or conversation and (iii) in the event one such Party is
prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental
Authority from participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any
such conversation, keep such non-participating Party reasonably apprised with
respect thereto.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
8.01(f)_, each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make or cause
to be made any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if
any, that a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction asserts with
respect to any Required Competition Approval under any applicable Competition
Law with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
applicable Competition Laws asserted by any such Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, to the extent necessary so as
to enable the Closing to occur no later than the End Date, which reasonable
best efforts shall include (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or disposition of any businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Company (or any of
their respective Subsidiaries), (y) creating, terminating, or divesting
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or committing
to take any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) (each of (x), (y) and (z),
the "Competition Actions"), in each case as may be required in order to
obtain any Required Competition Approval to the extent necessary so as to
enable the Closing to occur no later than the End Date. In addition each of
Parent and the Company shall take any Competition Action to the extent
necessary to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order by
a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction under any Competition Law
(each, a "Competition Law Order") prohibiting the consummation of the Merger.
To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in this _Section
8.01(e)_, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements requested by Parent to be
entered into by any of them prior to the Closing with respect to any
transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that limits
the Companys or its Subsidiaries freedom of action, ownership or control
with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly,
any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Divestiture Action");
provided, however, that the consummation of the

 



69  transactions provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action
shall be conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately
following such Divestiture Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event the Parties are unable to agree on which actions
to take pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_, Parent shall have the final
determination with respect to which action to take; provided, that such
determination shall be consistent with Parents obligations under this
_Section 8.01(e)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or limitation
contemplated in this _Section 8.01_, including any step or undertaking or
action contemplated in _Section 8.01(e)_, that (i) would, or would
reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations, or financial condition of either (x) Parent and its
Subsidiaries (but not including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (y) the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (in each case of (x) and (y), measured on a
scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii)
would require Parent to take any of the actions described on _Section
8.01(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iii) in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Competition Law Order in a
jurisdiction other than the United States or the European Union, would
require Parent to take any action with respect to any business, properties or
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, or the Company and its Subsidiaries,
located outside of the home country of the Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction in respect of such a Competition Law Order (either of
(i), (ii) or (iii) above, a "Burdensome Condition").

 

(g) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 8.01, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding by the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice or other
similar Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction is instituted
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Competition Law, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that Parent shall
not be required to, and the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, take any action under this _Section 8.01(g)_ that would,
or would be reasonably likely to, result in the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in
this _Section 8.01(g)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide to Parent such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Parent.

 

Section 8.02 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement_. (a) As
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) and file with the
SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to the stockholders of the
Company relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (ii) Parent shall
prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the 1933
Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in

 



70  the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1934
Act, respectively. Subject to _Section 8.02(d)_ and _Section 8.03_, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include (i) a statement to the effect that
the Company Board has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are
advisable and (ii) the recommendation of the Company Board in favor of
approval and adoption of this Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
1933 Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding
to comments of the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement, Parent shall take all action reasonably required to be taken under
any all necessary state securities Laws or "blue sky" notice requirements in
connection with the Parent Stock Issuance. As promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement shall have become effective, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to its stockholders.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning
such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party to be included
therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Registration Statement, and the resolution of any comments to either
received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.

(c) The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of
any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or
for additional information and shall (A) supply each other with copies of (i)
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or the Registration Statement and (ii) all stop
orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement and (B) provide each
other with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response to those
comments and requests.

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the
approval of the other Parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that the Company, in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with the
terms hereof may amend or supplement the Proxy

 



71  Statement/Prospectus (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to
an amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
extent it contains (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a
statement of the reason of the board for making such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional information reasonably related to
the foregoing. Notwithstanding a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders
for approval and adoption, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article 10_.

 

Section 8.03 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
and, if applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to have returned to the
Company any confidential information that has been provided to any Person in
any such discussions or negotiations occurring in the six (6) months prior to
the date of this Agreement. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 10_ , the Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its officers, directors or employees or any Affiliate, investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it
or any of its Subsidiaries to (and shall use reasonable efforts to cause such
Persons not to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information which has not been
previously publicly disseminated), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiry or the making or submission of any inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) subject to _Section
8.03(b)_, approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) subject to _Section 8.03(b)_, approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other
agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or a Superior
Proposal (each an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"), (iv) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (vi) agree to do any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, following the receipt of a bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that was
unsolicited and made after the date of this Agreement in circumstances
not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, the Company may, in
response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, and subject to compliance with
_Section 8.03(b)(i)_, furnish information with respect to the Company to the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any
such nonpublic information relating to the Company to such Person, the
Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") that
(x) does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from
complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to Parent required
pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ and (y) contains provisions that in the
aggregate are no less 

 



72  restrictive on such Person (including with respect to any "standstill"
terms; _provided_ , that such "standstill" terms need not restrict a Person
from making proposals to the Company (including the Company Board) in respect
of a Company Acquisition Proposal) than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement,
and (B) promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) following furnishing any
such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously so furnished to Parent or its Representatives).

(b) Except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_, the Company Board
shall not (x) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (and only if): (I)
(A) a written Company Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation
of this Agreement is made to the Company by a Third Party and such Company
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn or (B) there has been an Intervening
Event; (II) in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (III) the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change:

(i) in the case of _Section 8.03(b)(I)(A)_, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal and/or authorize
the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or in the case
of _Section 8.03(b)(I)(B)_ make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless (A) the Company Board provides Parent at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall include, as applicable, (a) the information with respect to the Superior
Proposal that is specified in  _Section 8.03(b)(i)_, as well as a copy of
such Company Acquisition Proposal, or (b) the facts and circumstances in
reasonable detail of the Intervening Event; (B) during the three (3) Business
Days following such written notice (or such shorter period as is specified
below), the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by
the Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as
applicable; and (C) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period described
in the foregoing clause (B), the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors
(and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (a) the Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or (b) the
Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and in each case, that the failure to make such 

 



73  Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. Any material
amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 8.03_, and the
Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of occurrence) notify
Parent of any such new Company Acquisition Proposal and the Parties shall
comply with the provisions of this _Section 8.03(b)_ with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the period during which the Company Board
effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change and its Representatives
are required to negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such new Company
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to clause (B) above shall expire on the later
to occur of two (2) Business Days after the Company Board provides written
notice of such new Company Acquisition Proposal to Parent and the end of the
original three (3) Business Day period described in clause (B) above; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that (x) whether or not there is a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Section 10.01_, the Company Board shall submit this Agreement
for approval by the Company stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting
and (y) in the event there is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in
compliance with this _Section 8.03(b)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal,
the Company shall only enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect thereto by terminating this Agreement in accordance with _Section
10.01(d)(ii)_.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company and Parent set forth in
_Section 8.03(a)_ and _Section 8.03(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
that are received by, or any non-public information with regard to such
Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated regarding such Acquisition Proposal with, the Company
(or any of its Representatives), indicating, in connection with such notice,
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the inquiry, proposal
or offer and the material terms and conditions of any such inquiries,
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written
inquiries, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) of the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect
to any such inquiries, proposal or offers and the details of any material
changes to the status and material terms of any such inquiries, proposals or
offers (including any material amendments thereto or any change to the scope
or material terms or conditions thereof, and including copies of any written
inquiries, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements and
modifications thereto).

(d) Nothing contained in this  _Section 8.03_ or _Section 8.05_, but in all
cases subject to _Section 8.03(b)_ or _Section 8.03(b)(i)_, as applicable,
shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to
their stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the 1934 Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the 1934 Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to their stockholders if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that the failure
to make such disclosure would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



74 Section 8.04 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to consummate the Financing or any Substitute
Financing as promptly as possible following the date of this Agreement (and,
in any event, no later than the Closing Date), including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) (A) maintain in effect the Debt Letters and in all material
respects comply with all of their respective obligations thereunder and (B)
negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing reflecting the terms contained in the Debt Letters (or with other
terms agreed by Parent and the Financing Source Parties, subject to the
restrictions on amendments of the Debt Letters set forth below), so that such
agreements are in effect no later than the Closing, and (ii) satisfying on a
timely basis all the conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements
related thereto that are in Parents (or its Affiliates) control. In the
event that all conditions set forth in  _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ have been
satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, Parent and
its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons
providing the Financing (the "Financing Parties") to fund on the Closing Date
the Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall,
promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof, give the Company written notice
of any (A) material breach or default by a Financing Party or any party to any
definitive document related to the Financing of the Debt Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing, (B) actual or threatened
withdrawal, repudiation or termination in writing of the Debt Letters or the
Financing by the Financing Parties or (C) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any information
that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such
privilege is asserted in good faith. Parent may amend, modify, terminate,
assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Letters without the prior written
approval of the Company, _provided_ , that Parent shall not, without Companys
prior written consent, permit any such amendment, modification, assignment,
termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any
provision of or remedy under the Debt Letters which would (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount) such that the aggregate funds that
would be available to Parent on the Closing Date would not be sufficient to
provide the funds required to be funded on the Closing Date to consummate
the Merger, or (B) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the
Financing (unless such expanded, amended or modified conditions are in the
aggregate substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the Company and
Parent than) the existing conditions to the Financing, or (C) otherwise
expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters in a manner
that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or
make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (2) materially adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Financing
Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto or (3) materially adversely affect the ability of Parent
to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby;

 



75   _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may modify,
supplement or amend the Debt Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
the Debt Letters as of the date of this Agreement. In the event that new
commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters
permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.04_, such new commitment letters and/or
fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and deemed to be
the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement of the Debt Letters. If funds in the amounts set forth
in the Debt Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event to (x) notify the Company in writing
thereof, (y) obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable to Parent, taken as a whole, than the terms and
conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, taking into account any "market
flex" provisions thereof) sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its terms
(the "Substitute Financing") and (z) obtain a new financing commitment letter
that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new
commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably
satisfactory to the Persons providing such Substitute Financing removing only
the fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market
flex" and other economic terms that could not adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of
the Financing) and related definitive financing documents with respect to
such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the Debt
Letters.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Corp expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents
nor Merger Corps obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Corp obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or
any other financing.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to,
provide to Parent such customary cooperation, as may be reasonably requested
by Parent to assist Parent in causing the conditions in the Debt Letters to be
satisfied and such customary cooperation as is otherwise reasonably requested
by Parent solely in connection with obtaining the Financing, which reasonable
best efforts shall include:

 

(i) reasonable cooperation with customary marketing efforts of Parent for all
or any portion of the Financing, including causing its management team, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, and external auditors to assist in
preparation for and to participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions
and sessions with rating agencies, in each case, upon reasonable notice and
at mutually agreeable dates and times;

 



76 (ii) providing reasonable assistance with the preparation of customary
rating agency presentations, road show materials, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and bank syndication materials, offering documents, private
placement memoranda and similar documents customarily required (which may
incorporate, by reference, periodic and current reports filed by the Company
with the SEC) in connection with the marketing and syndication of Financing
(as set forth in the Debt Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
or in connection with a customary offering of debt securities of the type
described in the second paragraph of the introduction to the Commitment
Letter;

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent, within a reasonable
amount of time following Parents reasonable request, with information
available to the Company relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
extent required to consummate the Financing in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in connection
with a customary offering of debt securities of the type described in the
second paragraph of the introduction to the Commitment Letter, and providing
reasonable assistance to the Parents preparation of pro forma financial
information and projections required to consummate the Financing in accordance
with the terms of the Debt Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement
or in connection with a customary offering of debt securities of the type
described in the second paragraph of the introduction of the Commitment
Letter;

 

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent at least three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (to the extent requested within 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date), with all documentation and other information
related to the Company and its Subsidiaries as and solely to the extent
required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Financing (as set

arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner
that does not result in the loss of attorney client privilege) or (v)
such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to clauses (i)
through (iv) of this _Section 8.07(a)_, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain the required consent
of such third party to provide such access or disclosure or (B) develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company.

effect in accordance with its terms.

 



80 Section 8.08 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may
be required to cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative

individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of

the other Parties hereto in writing of any litigation related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that is brought, or, to the knowledge of such Party, threatened in writing,
against such Party and/or its directors (any such litigation relating to the
Company and/or directors of the Company, a "Company Transaction Litigation")
and shall keep such other Party reasonably informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof. Other than with respect to any Company
Transaction Litigation where Parent is adverse to the Company, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint
defense agreement, in the defense or settlement of any Company Transaction
Litigation, and the Company shall not settle, agree to any undertakings or
approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in connection with
such Company Transaction Litigation, without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Prior to
the consummation of the Merger, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Parent shall not settle any litigation related to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless such
settlement provides a full and unconditional release for each officer and
director of the Company party to such litigation. Without limiting in any way
the Parties obligations under  _Section 8.01_, each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in

termination, could have been terminated, by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_ or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_, then, in each case, the Company shall
pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to Parent a fee in the
amount of $367,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") at or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to

termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(i)_.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, or at the time of
termination, could have been terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iv)_, or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(ii)(B)_ or by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ (and at such time Parent could have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(ii)(B)_), and (I) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and (A) prior to such termination
(x) a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or communicated to
the Company Board (whether or not publicly announced or publicly made known)
and shall not have been withdrawn and (y) the Company shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement in a manner that would give rise to the
failure of a condition under this Agreement, (B) or prior to the applicable
Company breach (in the case of a termination pursuant to  _Section
10.01(c)(ii)(B)_ or _Section 10.01(b)(i)_), a Company Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made or communicated to the Company Board (whether or not
publicly announced or publicly made known) and shall not have been withdrawn,
or (C) prior to the taking of a vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company
Stockholder Meeting or at any

 



86  adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of a termination pursuant
to _Section 10.01(b)(iv)_) a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or publicly made known and shall not have been withdrawn,
and (II) within nine months after such termination, the Company shall have
entered into an agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or
any Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (in each case,
whether or not such Company Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original
Company Acquisition Proposal made, communicated, publicly made known or
publicly announced), then, in any such event, the Company shall pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to Parent the Company Termination Fee
on the earlier to occur of the Company entering into an agreement with respect
to such Company Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of such Company
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" in this _Section 10.03(b)_,
references to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%."

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated, or at the time of termination,
could have been terminated, by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section
10.01(b)(iv)_ at a time when the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee are not otherwise payable, then the Company shall pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to Parent an amount equal to
the documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent and its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including all such expenses related to the Financing),
not to exceed 50% of such incurred expenses, as promptly as practicable (and
in any event, within two Business Days) following receipt of an invoice
therefor.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due

certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time. This _Section 11.01_ shall not limit
_Section 10.02_, _Section 10.03_ or any covenant or agreement of the
Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Section 11.02 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company or Parent
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the Parties hereto at any time
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law without such
approval having first been obtained; _provided_ further that, no amendments to
or waivers of any DFS Provision shall be effective without the written

the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the

proviso of _Section 11.02_, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law,
no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of the stockholders of
either Parent or the Company. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any
of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of
such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

Section 11.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the

of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in
a manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties

respect to representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger
Corp as of the date of this Agreement) and all representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Merger Corp as of the date of this Agreement shall
also be made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ , that such assignment shall not relieve Parent of
its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any obligation
of any other party hereto or due to Parent or such other Subsidiary. This

the Financing Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the domestic Law of the State of New York

whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject to the limitations in Section 10.03(f) and in the next sentence of
this  _Section 11.12(a)_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the

 



91  terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

itself, and hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the
State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter
jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any
objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in
the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter
jurisdiction, and (d) consents to service of process being made through the
notice procedures set forth in _Section 11.05_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute
arising out of the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the Financing,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

this Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Financing, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
Representatives agrees not to commence a Proceeding against any Financing
Source Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder (including any Proceeding relating to the Financing or
the Debt Letters). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is agreed that no Financing Source Party shall have any liability
for any claims, losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses,
fines or penalties to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, stockholders,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder. Nothing in
this Section 11.14 shall in any way (a) expand the circumstances in which
Parent may be liable under this Agreement or as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including as a result of the Financing) or
(b) limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the
Debt Letters to each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

 



92 Section 11.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR THE
