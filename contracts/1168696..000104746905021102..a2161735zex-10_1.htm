 2.8 Prorations Adjustment.

  

  

 (a) The items of income and expense, as the case may be, set forth below shall be prorated as of the Effective Time, so that Seller shall bear all such income and expense with respect to the Purchased Assets through and including the period preceding the Effective Time, and Buyer shall bear all such income and expense with respect to the Purchased Assets on and after the Effective Time. Prorations shall be made pursuant to a preliminary settlement statement ("Preliminary Settlement Statement") prepared in good faith and delivered by Seller to Buyer not earlier than 20 calendar days and not later than 10 calendar days prior to Closing, together with such supplemental calculations and information as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Buyer to determine the accuracy thereof. The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall be based upon the most current and reliable information reasonably available to Seller at the time of its delivery, and may be based upon estimates where actual amounts are impractical to obtain or verify. Within 5 calendar days of Buyer\'s receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer shall notify the Seller in writing whether Buyer approves the Preliminary Settlement Statement. If Buyer approves the Preliminary Settlement Statement, or fails to notify Seller of its disapproval at the time specified above, then the proration amount shall be as set forth on the Preliminary Settlement Statement initially delivered by Seller to Buyer. If Buyer disapproves the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the Seller and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to agree upon the amounts to be set forth on such Preliminary Settlement Statement. The amounts set forth on the Preliminary Settlement Statement shall be subject to adjustment or correction on the Post Closing Settlement Statement. Buyer\'s approval or disapproval of the Preliminary 

  

      

  

Settlement Statement shall not be a condition to Closing, and any
disagreements regarding the Preliminary Settlement Statement shall be resolved
at the time and in the manner provided for resolution of disagreements about
the Post Closing Settlement Statement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve all disagreements regarding the Preliminary Settlement Statement of
Seller prior to the Closing, then the proration amount shall be as set forth
on the Preliminary Settlement Statement initially delivered by Seller to
Buyer, with such modifications thereto, if any, to which Buyer and Seller
have agreed.

  

 (b) The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall set forth the following information as a credit or debit to Buyer or Seller as applicable: 

    

 (i) (A) Real property taxes and assessments which are (x) a lien against the Real Property, (y) separately assessed against such premises and (z) payable by Seller directly to the tax collector or reimbursed dollar for dollar to the corresponding lessor, shall be prorated as of the Closing Date and any such amount up to and including the Closing Date shall be Seller\'s obligation and any amount after the Closing Date shall be Buyer\'s obligation and (B) real property Taxes and assessments which are a lien against the Real Property, but are not separately assessed, or are neither payable by Seller directly to the tax collector or reimbursed dollar for dollar to the lessor, shall be allocated between Buyer and the Seller in a reasonable manner, based upon the best estimates of Buyer and Seller and, in the case of the Assigned Leases, prior billings therefor by the corresponding lessor. 

  

 (ii) Personal property taxes, sales taxes, and other state, county and municipal Taxes other than those Taxes on real property described in Section 2.8(b)(i) above (but not including any Tax based on income), imposed on a periodic basis and payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date and arising out of the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets, shall be prorated as of the Closing Date and any such amount up to and including the Closing Date shall be Seller\'s obligation and any amount after the Closing Date shall be Buyer\'s obligation. 

  

 (iii) Monthly or other periodic rent under the Assigned Leases, whether paid in arrears or in advance.

 (v) Payments and charges under Purchased Contracts and Assigned Leases (to the extent such payments and charges are included in the Assumed Liabilities). 

  

 (vi) Electrical, gas, telephone, sewer and water utility service for the Real Property. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause meters to be read for such utilities as close to the Effective Time as possible. To the extent such meters are read, adjustments shall be based upon such readings, using the number of Business Days prior to and after the reading, and prior to and after the Effective Time. To the extent such meters are not read, adjustments shall be made using the most recently received bill for such utility service. In no event shall Seller cause any of the services to be physically terminated, shut off or interrupted; provided, however, Seller shall not be responsible for any service interruption if Buyer does not make reasonable efforts to establish or continue any service with the applicable utility service provider following the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause Seller to be released from obligations to (or to cause non-cash deposits to be released by) all applicable utility service providers. In the event Seller is charged by, and pays, any Person for any such utilities or services for the period after the 

   

      

   
  

Effective Time, such amounts shall be included in the Post-Closing Settlement
Statement upon delivery by Seller to Buyer of an invoice itemizing such
charges and payments made by Seller, together with reasonable evidence that
Seller has paid such amounts.

 (d) Buyer shall deliver a post-closing settlement statement (the "Post-Closing Settlement Statement") to Seller not later than April 15, 2006, together with such supplemental calculations and information as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Seller to determine the accuracy thereof. The Post-Closing Settlement Statement shall be based upon the most current and reliable information reasonably available to Buyer at the time of its delivery. Within 30 calendar days of the Seller\'s receipt of the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, Seller shall notify the Buyer in writing whether Seller approves the Post-Closing Settlement Statement. If Seller approves the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, or fails to notify Buyer of its disapproval in the manner and within the time specified above, then the Post-Closing Settlement Statement shall be as delivered to Seller. If Seller disapproves the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, then the Seller and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to agree upon the amounts to be set forth in the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, and the Post-Closing Settlement Statement shall be amended accordingly. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon the amounts to be set forth in the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, then the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, or its successor, is designated to act as sole arbitrator and to decide all points of disagreement with respect to the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, such decision to be binding on the parties. If such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, then the Seller and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to designate and retain another mutually acceptable nationally-recognized accounting firm not retained for general audit purposes by either of them as the sole arbitrator under this Section 2.8. The costs and expenses of the arbitrator, whether the firm designated above, or otherwise designated, shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. Within 5 Business Days after the Post-Closing Settlement Statement has been agreed upon or disagreements resolved, Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly make a payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the other party in an amount equal to the difference between the closing payment set forth on the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the proration amount set forth on the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, together with interest for the period from and including the Closing Date through and including the date of payment at the "prime" rate of interest as published from time to time by The Wall Street Journal in its "Money Rates" section in effect from time to time during such period.

Between the Execution Date and the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing if it becomes aware of (a) any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of its representations and warranties made as of the Execution Date or (b) the occurrence after the Execution Date of any fact or condition that would or could be reasonably likely to (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had that representation or warranty been made as of the time of the occurrence of, or Seller\'s discovery of, such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition require any change to the Disclosure Schedule, the Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule specifying such change. Such delivery shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any breach or affect any rights of Buyer under Article 7, 

        
  

Article 9 and Article 11\. During the same period, Seller also shall promptly
notify Buyer of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Seller in this
Article 5 or of the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of
the conditions in Article 7 impossible or unlikely.

  

 5.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Seller shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the conditions in Article 7 to be satisfied on or prior to the Closing. 

  

 5.7 Interim Financial Statement. Until the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer within twenty (20) calendar days after the end of each month and within forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of each fiscal quarter a copy of the financial statements for such month and fiscal quarter, respectively. Such financial statements and the deliveries under Section 2.8 shall be prepared in a manner and containing information consistent with Seller\'s current practices and certified by Seller\'s chief financial officer as to compliance of such financial statements with Section 3.4. 

   

 5.8 Payment of Liabilities. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall pay or otherwise satisfy in the Ordinary Course of Business all of its Liabilities and obligations which become due and payable. 

  

 5.9 Current Evidence of Title.

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Execution Date, Buyer obtained title commitments issued by the Title Company for all of the Real Property, together with complete copies of all recorded documents appearing as Schedule B exceptions thereto (each of the foregoing title commitments being referred to herein as a "Title Commitment" and collectively, the "Title Commitments"). 

    

 (1) Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, to cause to be furnished to the Title Company one or more surveys of some or all of the Real Property. Buyer shall order all such surveys within 5 calendar days of the Execution Date; it being understand that Seller shall be responsible for ordering the Retail Center Surveys as provided in Section 5.16 hereof. On or before the sixth day after the Execution Date, Buyer shall notify Seller of any parcels of the Real Property for which Buyer has elected not to obtain a survey. Buyer shall have until the later of (i) the Due Diligence Deadline or (ii) five Business Days after the receipt of the last Title Commitment or updated survey for any of the Real Property ("Title Period") to complete, review and revise to the satisfaction of Buyer those surveys which it has elected to obtain. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the duration of the Title Period be more than fifty (50) calendar days from the Execution Date. 

  

 (2) On or prior to the final day of the Title Period, Buyer may deliver to Seller one or more written notices ("Disapproved Matters Notice") identifying with specificity the matters set forth in the Title Commitments, the existing surveys and any new surveys of the Real Property which Buyer disapproves (the "Disapproved Matters"). If Buyer does not deliver a Disapproved Matters Notice to Seller within the Title Period, then Buyer shall be irrevocably deemed to have waived (i) all title and survey matters set forth in the Title Commitments, the existing surveys and any new surveys and (ii) any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.9. Buyer shall not unreasonably disapprove any of such foregoing matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall (a) make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remove all Disapproved Matters that are reasonably disapproved by Buyer; (b) cause the removal of all voluntary and involuntary monetary liens; (c) furnish to the Title Company with respect to all of the Real Property (not just Royal Park) evidence, affidavits, resolutions, certificates, approvals and satisfactions of the type specified for the Royal Park Property in paragraphs 3, 4(a) and 5 of Schedule B-1 of the Title Commitment issued February 23, 2005 having the Title Company\'s File No. NCS-145506-B (Royal Park); and (d) unless the Cinema 4 Lease is an Excluded Asset at the time of Closing, deliver an 

   

      

   
  

affidavit and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Title Company to
delete exceptions appearing in the Title Commitment for the Cinema 4 Property
for memoranda of lease, and memoranda of assignment of lease, predating the
Cinema 4 Lease. Nothing contained in or omitted from a Disapproved Matters
Notice shall constitute a waiver by Buyer of timely compliance by Seller of
any covenants on Seller\'s part to be performed pursuant to any other
Sections of this Agreement.

  

 (3) Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a Disapproved Matters Notice, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written notice (a "Disapproved Matters Cure Notice") identifying with specificity those Disapproved Matters, if any, in the Disapproved Matters Notice that Seller does not intend to cure, and Seller shall be irrevocably deemed to have agreed to cure, at or prior to the Effective Time, all other Disapproved Matters set forth in the Disapproved Matters Notice. If Seller does not deliver a Disapproved Matters Cure Notice within ten calendar days after receipt of a Disapproved Matters Notice, then Seller shall be irrevocably deemed to have agreed to cure, at or prior to the Effective Time, all Disapproved Matters set forth in such Disapproved Matters Notice. 

  

 (4) Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a Disapproved Matters Cure Notice, Buyer may deliver to Seller a written notice (a "Disapproved Matters Termination Notice") terminating this Agreement. If Buyer does not deliver a Disapproved Matters Termination Notice within such period, then Buyer shall be irrevocably deemed to have waived (i) cure of those Disapproved Matters specifically identified by Seller in the Disapproved Matters Cure Notice as matters that Seller did not intend to cure and (ii) any right to terminate this Agreement based on such matters. 

  

 (5) Removal of a Disapproved Matter may be by way of deletion of the exception or by endorsement over the exception by the Title Company (and may be accomplished by the Seller by bonding) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. 

  

 (6) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any new title or survey matter with respect to any Real Property shall appear in any supplemental or updated title report, commitment, pro forma title policy or survey received by Buyer after the delivery by Buyer to Seller of the Disapproved Matters Notice, and if such new matter arose after the effective date of the Title Commitment for such Real Property received prior to the expiration of the Title Period, then Buyer may object in writing to such exception within five Business Days after Buyer\'s receipt of such supplement or update, and such matter shall be treated as a Disapproved Matter, notice thereof from Buyer to Seller shall be deemed a Disapproved Matters Notice, and such Disapproved Matter and Disapproved Matters Notice shall be subject to paragraphs (2) through (5) inclusive above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not constitute Disapproved Matters: (a) utility, access and reciprocal easements granted by Seller after the Execution Date (and approved in writing by Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); (b) liens attributable to acts or omissions of Buyer or Buyer\'s Representatives; (c) liens on Leased Real Property attributable to acts or omissions of Persons (such as Seller\'s lessor with respect to any Assigned Lease) other than (y) Seller and (z) Persons claiming under Seller; (d) liens of real property taxes and assessments that are not yet delinquent, such taxes being prorated pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, Buyer acknowledges that Seller has executed or anticipates executing the following instruments, which shall be subject to this Section 5.9: (a) a Second Amendment to Dedication and Cross Easement Agreement and Declaration of Restrictions to be executed and recorded with respect to the Birkdale parcel of Real Property; (b) a Grant of Easement and Right of Way and Deed of Sewer Utility Facilities which was recorded with respect to the Sandhill Property; (c) a Deed to Water Lines for the Village at Sandhill Theatre, Richland County which was 

   

      

   
  

recorded with respect to the Sandhill Property; and (d) other utility
easement documents to be executed and recorded with respect to the Sandhill
Property.

  

 (7) Any Disapproved Matter identified in the Disapproved Matters Notice delivered to Seller pursuant to this Section 5.9 (including without limitation identified pursuant to Section 5.9(a)(6)) shall not be deemed to be a Known Breach. 

    

 (b) Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct complete and current searches, at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, in the name of Seller and other appropriate parties of all Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement records maintained by the Secretary of State of the state in which Seller is organized, the state in which Seller maintains its principal place of business, each jurisdiction in which a filing would be required in order to perfect a security interest in the Purchased Assets, the clerk or recorder of deeds (or other governmental office where real property documents are filed for recording) of each county in which any Real Property is located and wherever else Seller or Buyer, based upon its investigation, is aware that a Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement has been filed. 

  

 (c) Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to obtain, at Buyer\'s expense, such zoning reports and zoning analyses as Buyer deems necessary or appropriate regarding the Real Property. In connection with such reports or analyses, Buyer may request and obtain zoning letters from Governmental Bodies having jurisdiction over zoning, subdivision and land use matters affecting the Real Property. 

  

 (d) With respect to the Sandhill Property, Seller shall obtain and deliver to the Title Company, prior to Closing, unconditional lien releases (or post bonds to obtain affirmative title coverage against any such liens) from all Persons that may be entitled to file or record mechanics liens, design professional liens or other similar liens, in form and substance satisfactory to the Title Company, on or with respect to any work of improvement on the Sandhill Property. The form of such releases for the Sandhill Property shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Title Company, for the purpose of allowing the Title Company to issue a CLTA 101.1 endorsement to the Title Policy for the Sandhill Property. Seller shall also obtain and deliver to the Title Company, within 5 calendar days of the Execution Date, evidence in form and substance satisfactory to the Title Company that Seller is the sole holder of record and beneficial fee title to the Sandhill Property. Seller shall also deliver to the Title Company and to Buyer, prior to Closing, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Title Company that (1) Seller has paid to Sandhill Development Manager its pro rata share of the 2004 real property tax bill for the Sandhill Property pursuant to Section 1 of the Sandhill Tax Agreement; and (2) all rollback taxes on the Sandhill Property referenced in Section 2 of the Sandhill Tax Agreement have been paid in full, and the liens thereof have been released and/or discharged in full; provided that if Seller does not deliver such evidence prior to Closing, then Seller shall grant to Buyer, at Closing, a credit equal to $4,418.17 in respect of such taxes. Seller shall also either (i) deliver to the Title Company and to Buyer, prior to Closing, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Title Company that all assessments on the Sandhill Property for the Village at Sandhill Improvement District have been prepaid in full, and the liens thereof have been released or discharged in full; or (ii) otherwise, grant Seller, at Closing, a credit against the Purchase Price equal to $907,432.83 in respect of such assessments. 

  

 (e) With respect to the Retail Center Owned Properties, Seller shall cause Parent and/or Seller to deliver to the Title Company, prior to Closing, such information and affidavits as are necessary or appropriate to enable the Title Company to insure Buyer\'s interests in the easement parcels created by the Retail Center REAs, without exceptions other than Permitted Exceptions. 

  

 (f) With respect to the Azalea Square Property, Seller shall deliver to the Title Company, prior to the Closing, such information and affidavits as are necessary or appropriate to enable the 

  

      

  
  

Title Company to insure Buyer\'s interests therein, without exception for the
Azalea Square Option to Repurchase. With respect to the Birkdale Property,
Seller shall deliver to the Title Company, prior to the Closing, such
information and affidavits as are necessary or appropriate to enable the Title
Company to insure Buyer\'s interests therein, without exception for the option
to repurchase contained in Section 2 of the Birkdale Declaration.

  

  

 5.10 Physical Condition of Real Property (Other than Environmental Conditions).

  

  

 (a) Buyer shall order all inspections of the physical condition of the Real Property (other than Environmental Conditions) which it desires to obtain with respect to any Real Property within five (5) days after the Execution Date. Buyer shall notify Seller on the sixth (6th) day following the Execution Date of all parcels of Real Property for which it did not order an inspection of the physical condition (other than Environmental Conditions). Except to the extent that Buyer has elected not to obtain such an inspection for any parcel of Real Property, Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to have such inspections completed and reviewed by the Due Diligence Deadline. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, regardless of whether Buyer engages a Third Party to inspect the physical condition of any Real Property (other than Environmental Condition), Buyer shall also have the right to have it employees inspect the physical condition of the Real Property (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 5.10(b)). 

  

 (b) Subject to the rights of Buyer in Section 7.9, Buyer shall have until the later of (i) the Due Diligence Deadline or (ii) five Business Days after the receipt of the last written physical condition report for any parcel of Real Property to deliver to Seller a written notice setting forth its reasonable objections, if any, to the physical condition (other than Environmental Conditions) of the Real Property, which are supported by a written report from Persons with qualifications sufficient to make such objections, including without limitation, Ron Reid ("Physical Inspection Deadline"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Physical Inspection Deadline be more than fifty (50) calendar days from the Execution Date. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cure each such objection to Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction within 30 calendar days of the date of the last notice sent by Buyer or prior to the Closing, whichever is earlier; provided however, Seller shall not have any obligation to cure such objections to the physical condition (other than environmental matters) if the amount to cure such objections is less than $25,000 at a Real Property or less than $500,000 in the aggregate for all Real Property. If the amount to cure such objections is equal to or more than $25,000 at a Real Property, then Seller shall be obligated to cure all such objections at such theatre or if the amount to cure such objections is equal to or more than $500,000 in the aggregate for all Real Property, then Seller shall be obligated to cure all objections for all Real Property (collectively "Threshold Objections") up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000. In the event that Seller (upon using Commercially Reasonable Efforts) is not able to cure a Threshold Objection that it is obligated to cure pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree to an adjustment to the Purchase Price to reflect the costs and expense of such Threshold Objections. Any objection identified in Buyer\'s written notice delivered to Seller pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) shall not be deemed to be a Known Breach. 

  

  

 5.11 No Solicitation. Seller shall not and shall not authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with or provide any non-public information to any Person (other than Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their Representatives or as required by the HSR Act) concerning any Third-Party Acquisition and the Seller will terminate or cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations concerning any Third-Party Acquisition. The Seller shall immediately notify Buyer in the event it receives any bona fide proposal concerning a Third-Party Acquisition, including the terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party submitting such proposal, and will promptly update Buyer of the status and any material developments concerning the same. 

        

 5.12 Consents. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain all Consents listed in the schedules to Section 3.2 by the Due Diligence Deadline. If there are any Consents that have not yet been obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) as of the Closing, in the case of each Purchased Contract as to which such Consents were not obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) (the "Restricted Contracts"), Buyer may waive the closing conditions as to any such Consent and either: (a) elect to have the Seller continue its efforts to obtain the Consent; or (b) elect to have the Seller retain that Restricted Contract (including an appropriate Purchase Price adjustment) and all Liabilities arising therefrom or relating thereto. If Buyer elects to have the Seller continue its efforts to obtain any Consent and the Closing occurs, notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.4, neither this Agreement nor the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption nor any other document related to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Restricted Contract, and following the Closing, the Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Consent relating to each Restricted Contract as quickly as practicable. Once a Consent for the sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Restricted Contract obtained, the Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted Contract to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume the obligations under such Restricted Contract from and after the date of assignment to Buyer pursuant to a special-purpose assignment and assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption. 

  

 5.13 Estoppels and Consents; SNDAs; Memoranda of Leases.

  

  

 (a) With respect to each Assigned Lease, the Seller shall promptly after the Execution Date request that the lessor thereunder execute instruments in the form of Exhibit 2.7(a)(iv)(1) attached hereto. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain such an instrument from each such lessor, completed and duly executed by such lessor on or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline. Seller and Buyer shall make such modifications to the forms attached hereto as Exhibit 2.7(a)(iv)(1) as such lessors shall reasonably request. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) Seller shall not require any release of any obligations or liabilities of Seller under an Assigned Lease if the lessor declines to grant such release; and (2) Buyer shall not require the inclusion of paragraph 1(b) (other than the first sentence thereof) and paragraphs 7(b) through (e) in the form of Lease Assignment and Assumption for the North Hills Property. Within 5 calendar days of receipt of any estoppel and consent executed by any such lessor, Seller shall deliver a true and complete copy thereof to Buyer. 

   

 (b) Seller shall promptly after the Execution Date request that the Cinema 4 Landlord execute a memorandum of lease in the form of Exhibit 5.13(b) attached hereto. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain the Cinema 4 Memorandum, duly executed and acknowledged by the Cinema 4 Landlord and otherwise in recordable form, on or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline; provided, however, it may be provided at Closing by Seller as long as the Cinema 4 Memorandum names Buyer as lessee. If the Cinema 4 Memorandum is to be delivered at Closing, then the Cinema 4 Memorandum may name Buyer as lessee. Within 5 calendar days of receipt by Seller of the Cinema 4 Memorandum executed by the Cinema 4 Landlord, Seller shall deliver a true and complete copy thereof to Buyer. 

  

 (c) If, upon exercise of Commercially Reasonable Efforts, Seller is unable to obtain the Cinema 4 Consent or the Cinema 4 Memorandum on or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline, then Seller shall so notify Buyer and Buyer may thereafter negotiate with the Cinema 4 Landlord directly. In the event that Seller and Buyer are thereafter unable to obtain the Cinema 4 Consent or Cinema 4 Memorandum prior to the Closing, then the Cinema 4 Property shall be excluded from the Contemplated Transactions and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $1,112,447. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, Seller\'s failure to obtain the Cinema 4 

  

      

  
  

Consent or the Cinema 4 Memorandum shall not be an event permitting Buyer to
elect to terminate this Agreement.

  

 (d) With respect to each Assigned Lease or New Lease which is a sublease, Seller shall promptly after the Execution Date request that each superior lessor execute a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain such a non-disturbance agreement on or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline; provided that Seller shall have no such obligation with respect to any superior lessor that has previously executed such a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement which is assignable by Seller to Buyer. 

  

 (e) With respect to each Assigned Lease or New Lease which is subordinate to a mortgage or deed of trust executed by the lessor, or by a superior lessor, the Seller shall promptly after the Execution Date request that the mortgagee or beneficiary of each such deed of trust execute a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain such a non-disturbance agreement on or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline; provided that Seller shall have no such obligation with respect to any mortgagee or beneficiary that has previously executed such a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement which is assignable by Seller to Buyer. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything set forth in any estoppel, consent, non-disturbance agreement or other memorandum which is executed or delivered pursuant to this Section 5.13, as between Buyer and Seller, this Agreement shall govern the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities under and with respect to the Assigned Leases. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding any contrary provision in any Lease Assignment and Assumption, the Liabilities of Seller under the Assigned Leases and the Liabilities of Buyer under the Assigned Leases shall be as provided in Section 2.4. 

  

  

 5.14 REA Estoppels and DDA Estoppels. With respect to each REA and DDA relating to Real Property which, by its terms, provides for delivery of an estoppel by one or more other Persons, Seller shall promptly after the Execution Date request that such Persons execute and deliver such an estoppel addressed to Buyer; it being understood that Seller shall not request such estoppels from all Persons who might be obligated to deliver such estoppels if an authorized representative of such Persons could and will timely execute and deliver an estoppel on behalf of such Persons. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain such an estoppel from each such counterparty, completed and duly executed by such party on or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline. Within 5 calendar days of receipt of any such estoppel, Seller shall deliver a true and complete copy thereof to Buyer. 

  

 5.15 Sandhill Property.

  

  

 (a) Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Sandhill Completion to occur on or before May 20, 2005. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing if at any time it appears that the Sandhill Completion is not likely to occur on or before such date. To the extent requested by Buyer, Seller shall schedule and attend meetings with Buyer, which shall be scheduled not more often than monthly, at the Sandhill Property to discuss the progress of the Sandhill Theatre Work and the Sandhill Site Work. Seller shall also supply Buyer with such reports and information respecting the progress of the Sandhill Theatre Work and Sandhill Site Work in form and substance as Buyer shall reasonably request. Upon the request of Buyer, Seller shall cause the Sandhill Theatre General Contractor and Sandhill Theatre Architect to attend such meetings. 

  

 (b) Seller shall also provide Buyer with prior written notice if: (i) Seller enters into, terminates, cancels, amends, modifies, supplements or waives performance of any Contract relating to the Sandhill Theatre Work or the Sandhill Site Work or (ii) Seller enters into, terminates, 

  

      

  
  

cancels, amends, modifies, consents to, acquiesces in, supplements or waives
performance of any material change orders with respect to the Sandhill Theatre
Work or the Sandhill Site Work. If any of such events are material, then
Buyer\'s prior written consent shall be required for any such action by
Seller.

  

 (c) Seller shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses related to the Sandhill Theatre Work.

 (b)(i) Except as set forth in Section 11.1(b)(iii) below, in the event that there is or are any breach or breaches of the representations and warranties of Seller (other than a breach of Sections 3.6(d), 3.6(e) or 3.18) that become known to Buyer prior to Closing based upon supplements to the Disclosure Schedules or through Buyer\'s exercise of its rights under Section 5.1 ("Known Breaches") and (A) the Damages related to such Known Breaches are less than or equal to $1,276,000 then Buyer shall proceed to Closing and the amount by which the Damages related to such Known Breaches are less than or equal to $1,276,000 shall be applied against the Basket, or (B) if the Damages related to such Known Breaches exceed $1,276,000 and Buyer elects to proceed to Closing, then (x) Buyer shall have waived any claim for indemnification based upon the Known Breaches to the extent that the Damages therefor exceed $1,276,000 and (y) such claims and Damages up to $1,276,000 shall be satisfied in full by application against the Basket so that the amount remaining in the Basket is $0. Notices of any such claims by Buyer and disputes over the alleged amount of Damages shall be handled as provided in the following paragraph. 

    

 (ii) Prior to Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a notice setting forth the Known Breaches, together with such supplemental information as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Seller to determine the accuracy thereof ("Breach Notice"). The Breach Notice shall be based upon the most current and reliable information reasonably available to Buyer at the time of its delivery. Within 2 Business Days after receipt of the Breach Notice, Seller shall notify the Buyer in writing whether Seller disapproves of the Breach Notice. If Seller does not dispute the Breach Notice, or fails to notify Buyer of its disapproval in the manner and within the time specified above, then the Breach Notice shall be deemed to be the notice of Known Breaches as delivered by Buyer to Seller. If Seller disapproves a Breach Notice in the manner and within the time specified above, then Seller and Buyer shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts for a period of 5 Business Days to agree to the Breach Notice, and the Breach Notice shall be amended accordingly. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon the Breach Notice, then the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, or its successor, is designated to act as sole arbitrator and to decide all points of disagreement with respect to the Breach Notice, such decision to be binding on both parties. If such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, Seller and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to designate and retain another mutually acceptable nationally-recognized accounting firm not retained for general audit purposes by either of them as the sole arbitrator under this Section 11.1(a)(ii). The costs and expenses of the arbitrator, whether the firm designated above, or otherwise designated, shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer.

environmental or physical investigation or assessment) conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such
representation and warranty set forth in Sections 3.6(d), 3.6(e) or 3.18. The
waiver of any condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.6(d), 3.6(e) or 3.18 will not affect the
right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy of Buyer based upon
such representations and warranties.

    

 (c) For purposes of determining whether there has been any misrepresentation or breach of warranty pursuant to this Article 11 and for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages arising therefrom, the representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer shall be deemed not to be qualified by any concept of "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification.

 11.7 Third-Party Claims.

  

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section 11.2 or 11.3 (an "Indemnified Person") of notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an "Indemnifying Person") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person\'s failure to give such notice. 

  

 (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to Article 11 of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying 

  

      

  
  

Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its
financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide
indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of
its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense,
be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article 11 for any fees
of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Third-
Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the
Indemnified Person\'s Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of
any violation of Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any
Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full
by the Indemnifying Person; and (C) the Indemnified Person shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party
Claims effected without its Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying
Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Person does not, within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Person\'s notice
is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will be bound by
any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or
settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.4, Seller hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any Buyer Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that a Buyer Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on Seller with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world. 

   

 (e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11 (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, shall keep the other Person reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. 

  

 (f) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11, the parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that (i) it will use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential Information (consistent with applicable Legal Requirements and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege. 

  

      

  
 

  

 11.8 Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought and shall be paid promptly after such notice. 

  

 11.9 Remedy. Subject to Section 9.2(a), the provisions of this Article 11 shall provide the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of Buyer with respect to any claims made or with respect to which indemnification may be sought under Section 11.2(a) through 11.2(d). Subject to Section 9.2(a), the provisions of this Article 11 shall provide the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of Seller with respect to any claims made or with respect to which indemnification may be sought under Section 11.3(a) through 11.3(e); provided, further that, except as provided in Section 5.1, 5.18 and 5.19, Seller hereby waives and releases any claims, rights and causes of action Seller may have against Buyer now or in the future arising under, in connection with or relating to any Environmental Law (whether by statute, regulation, or common law). 

   

 11.10 Mitigation of Damages. All parties hereto shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate Damages. 

  

 11.11 Reduction of Damages Attributable to an Actual Tax or Insurance Benefit.

  

  

 (a) Damages incurred by any Indemnified Person that are indemnifiable under this Article 11 will be reduced by an amount equal to any reduction in income Taxes actually paid with respect to a Tax period on account of the application of a deduction or other Tax Item attributable directly to such Damages, and the creation or increase in the amount of a net operating loss carryover or a carryover of another Tax shall not be treated as a reduction in the income Taxes actually paid with respect to such Tax period; provided, that, such reduction in Damages will apply only if (i) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, promptly upon payment of the indemnified amount under this Article 11 has notified the other in writing of such amount and the recipient\'s potential entitlement to a reduction of income Taxes on account of such Damages and/or indemnity payment and (ii) the actual reduction of income Taxes paid occurs with respect to the same Tax period as the application of a deduction (other than the application of a net operating loss carryover or Tax carried over from a prior Tax period) attributable directly to such Damages. In the event this Section 11.11(a) results in a reduction in the amount of Damages, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will reimburse the other for the amount of such reduction net of any income Taxes payable with respect to the receipt of the indemnity payment attributable to such Damages. 

  

 (b) Damages incurred by any Indemnified Person that are indemnifiable under this Article 11 will be reduced by an amount equal to any insurance benefits actually received by an Indemnified Person in respect of or as a result of such Damages. In the event this Section 11.11(b) results in a reduction in the amount of Damages, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will reimburse the other for the amount of such reduction with respect to the receipt of the indemnity payment attributable to such Damages.

 12.4 Arbitration.

  

  

 (a) In the event of any claim, dispute or controversy of any nature between the parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, delivery, performance, nonperformance, validity, termination or breach thereof ("Dispute"), and except as provided for in Section 2.8(d), Section 11.1(b)(ii) or Section 12.4(f), the parties will consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and otherwise use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to settle such Dispute within a 45-day period after receipt by a party of written notice of a Dispute. Except as set forth in Section 2.8(d) and Section 11.1(b)(i), if for any reason, the Dispute is not resolved or settled within such 45-day period then, upon the demand of Buyer or Seller, the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 USC § 1 et sec.) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (including Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes), as they may be amended from time to time (the "Rules") except as modified herein. An arbitration award rendered by the arbitrators will be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement, will be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to the arbitral tribunal and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their property. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 9.2(b), all fees and expenses of each party incurred in connection with the arbitration will be borne by the party incurring such costs, unless the arbitral tribunal determines that such costs should be borne by the other party. 

  

 (c) Before the arbitration hearing, each party shall be entitled to take a discovery deposition of up to three representatives of the opposing party who has knowledge of the matters in dispute. In addition, upon the application of a party showing good cause for the taking of a deposition intended to preserve evidence for introduction at trial, the arbitrator shall enter such orders as may be necessary to permit the preservation of such person or person(s) and such deposition(s) shall not count with respect to any limit imposed by agreement or otherwise on the number of discovery depositions allowed to be taken in connection with the arbitration. Further, upon the written request of either party, the other party shall promptly produce documents relevant to the Proceeding. The manner, timing and extent of any further discovery shall be committed to the arbitrator\'s sound discretion. 

   

 (d) The arbitral tribunal will be required to follow the substantive law of the State of Delaware, federal law as enunciated by the federal courts situated in the Third Circuit, and all 

  

      

  
  

federal rules relating to the admissibility of evidence, including, without
limitation, all relevant privileges and the attorney client work product
doctrine.

  

 (e) The arbitration award will be in writing and will specify factual and legal basis for the award. The arbitral tribunal will have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of the State of Delaware could order or grant, including specific performance, injunctive relief, money damages or such other relief as they deem just and proper. 

  

 (f) The parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware (the "Delaware Courts") for the purpose of obtaining an order to compel arbitration, or temporary restraining order, and enforcement of any award issued hereunder. In the event that a party obtains a temporary restraining order, the parties agree to immediately commence binding arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia in accordance with the Rules. In the event that a party obtains a temporary restraining order against the other party, the parties hereby agree that they will accelerate the selection of an arbitration panel as provided for in the Rules as follows: 

    

 (i) Any party that obtains a temporary restraining order shall, within three days of the issuance of such order, serve a written notice of its demand to arbitrate, which demand shall contain a statement setting forth the nature of the dispute, the names and addresses of all other parties, the amount involved, if any, and the remedy sought. 

  

 (ii) Within six days of obtaining a temporary restraining order, the party obtaining such order shall tender to the other party (the "Respondent") a list of five potential arbitrators from the National Roster of Commercial Arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association (the "National Roster"). The Respondent shall, within three days of receipt of such list, designate five potential arbitrators from the National Roster. 

  

 (iii) If the parties fail to agree on any of the persons named, or if acceptable arbitrators are unable to act, or if for any other reason the appointment cannot be made from the submitted lists, the American Arbitration Association shall have the power to make the appointment of one arbitrator (the "Preliminary Arbitrator(s)"). The "Preliminary Arbitrator(s)" shall be empowered to grant provisional remedies (including but not limited to extension of the temporary restraining order beyond the term provided for by the Court) until such time as a permanent arbitrator or arbitrators are appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Rules. 

    

 (g) By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral restraining order or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award. 

  

 (h) This agreement to arbitrate will be binding on all parties and their Affiliates, all Buyer Indemnified Persons, all Seller Indemnified Persons and on their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 (i) Disputes relating to Remediation of an Environmental Condition shall be resolved in accordance with the preceding provisions of Section 12.4, except as follows: 

    

 (i) The period to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing arbitration shall be twenty (20) days instead of the 45 days set forth in Section 12.4(a). 

  

 (ii) The process for selecting the arbitrator shall be as follows. The Parties shall jointly select a single arbitrator ("the Environmental Neutral") within twenty (20) days of receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. 

  

 (iii) Section 12.4(c), Section 12.4(d) and Section 12.4(f) shall not apply to arbitration of Disputes relating to Remediation. 

   

      

   
  

 (iv) Within ten (10) days of the selection of the Environmental Neutral, the party initiating dispute resolution shall submit a position paper to the Environmental Neutral and simultaneously to the other party setting forth a description of the dispute and its objections to the other party\'s claim and any relevant supporting documentation. The other party shall then have ten (10) days to submit a position paper in response, setting forth its description of the matters in dispute and its responses to the initiating party\'s objections and any supporting documentation. There shall be no depositions or other discovery undertaken in connection with the dispute resolution, and a hearing shall be held by the Environmental Neutral only if the Environmental Neutral determines that a hearing is necessary. If a party prevails with respect to every position that it asserts to the Environmental Neutral in a dispute resolution under this Section, it shall be entitled to payment of all of its costs arising from the dispute resolution by the non-prevailing party, which costs shall include, but not be limited to, consultants\' and attorneys\' fees and the fees of the Environmental Neutral. Otherwise, the cost of the Environmental Neutral shall be split by the parties, and each party shall bear their own expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12.4, the parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to conform all the deadlines set forth herein to any deadlines established by a Governmental Body with respect to the environmental matter in dispute, and that any Indemnified Person\'s payment of any costs with respect to such matter prior to the conclusion of the dispute resolution process shall in no way prejudice its ability to obtain indemnification for such sums. 

  

 (v) The parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for the purpose of obtaining an order to compel arbitration, or temporary restraining order, and enforcement of any award issued under this Section 12.4(i). The Environmental Neutral will be required to follow the substantive law of the State of Delaware, federal law as enunciated by the federal courts situated in the Third Circuit, and all federal rules relating to the admissibility of evidence, including, without limitation, all relevant privileges and the attorney client work product doctrine, except that the Environmental Laws and cleanup standards of the jurisdiction in which the Real Property is located shall apply to the extent relevant to the Dispute. 

   

  

 12.5 Enforcement of Section 10.4 of this Agreement. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer would be irreparably and immediately damaged if Section 10.4 is not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of Section 10.4 by Seller could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which Buyer may be entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce Section 10.4 of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and such injunctive relief as the court or arbitral tribunal may allow to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Seller agrees that it will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and that Buyer will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in arbitration, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted hereunder. 

  

 12.6 Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of the party 

        
  

giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand
as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  

 12.7 Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements (including without limitation the Exclusivity Agreement dated February 8, 2005, as amended on April 7, 2005, between Seller and Buyer and the Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agreement dated August 18, 2004 between Seller and Regal Cinemas, Inc.), whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the Disclosure Schedule, Exhibits and other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment. 

  

 12.8 Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

 (a) The information in the Disclosure Schedule constitutes (i) exceptions to particular representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller as set forth in this Agreement or (ii) descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other items referred to in this Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Schedule, the statements in this Agreement will control. 

  

 (b) The statements in the Disclosure Schedule, and those in any supplement thereto, relate only to the provisions in the Section of this Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any other provision in this Agreement. 

  

  

 12.9 Assignments, Successors and No Third-Party Rights. No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Buyer may assign any of its rights and delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate or subsidiary of Buyer; provided that Buyer shall remain liable with such assignee for the payment of the Purchase Price hereunder and for the payment and performance for all of its indemnity obligations under Article 11\. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to this Section 12.9. 

   

 12.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. 

  

 12.11 Construction. The headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references to "Articles," "Sections" and "Schedules" refer to the corresponding Articles, Sections and Schedules of this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 12.12 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts-of-laws principles that would require the application of any other law. 

  

 12.13 Execution of Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.
