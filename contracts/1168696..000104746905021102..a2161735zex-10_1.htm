cannot agree upon the amounts to be set forth in the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, then the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, or its successor, is designated to act as sole
arbitrator and to decide all points of disagreement with respect to the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, such decision to be binding on the parties. If such firm is unwilling or unable
to serve in such capacity, then the Seller and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to designate and retain another mutually acceptable nationally-recognized accounting firm not retained
for general audit purposes by either of them as the sole arbitrator under this Section&nbsp;2.8. The costs and expenses of the arbitrator, whether the firm designated above, or otherwise designated,
shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. Within 5 Business Days after the Post-Closing Settlement Statement has been agreed upon or
disagreements resolved, Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly make a payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the other party in an amount equal to the difference
between the closing payment set forth on the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the proration amount set forth on the Post-Closing Settlement Statement, together with interest for the
period from and including the Closing Date through and including the date of payment at the "prime" rate of interest as published from time to time by The Wall Street Journal in its "Money Rates"

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
arbitration award will be in writing and will specify factual and legal basis for the award. The arbitral tribunal will have the authority to award any remedy or
relief that a court of the State of Delaware could order or grant, including specific performance, injunctive relief, money damages or such other relief as they deem just and proper. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Courts</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") for the purpose of obtaining an order to compel arbitration, or temporary restraining order, and enforcement of any award issued hereunder. In the event that a party
obtains a temporary restraining order, the parties agree to immediately commence binding arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia in accordance with the Rules. In the event that a party obtains a temporary
restraining order against the other party, the parties hereby agree that they will accelerate the selection of an arbitration panel as provided for in the Rules as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
party that obtains a temporary restraining order shall, within three days of the issuance of such order, serve a written notice of its demand to arbitrate, which
demand shall contain a statement setting forth the nature of the dispute, the names and addresses of all other parties, the amount involved, if any, and the remedy sought. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
six days of obtaining a temporary restraining order, the party obtaining such order shall tender to the other party (the "Respondent") a list of five potential
arbitrators from the National Roster of Commercial Arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>National Roster</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The Respondent shall,
within three days of receipt of such list, designate five potential arbitrators from the National Roster. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the parties fail to agree on any of the persons named, or if acceptable arbitrators are unable to act, or if for any other reason the appointment cannot be made
from the submitted lists, the American Arbitration Association shall have the power to make the appointment of one arbitrator (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Preliminary
Arbitrator(s)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The "Preliminary Arbitrator(s)" shall be empowered to grant provisional remedies (including but not limited to extension of the temporary restraining order
beyond the term provided for by the Court) until such time as a permanent arbitrator or arbitrators are appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Rules. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral restraining order or other order in
aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
agreement to arbitrate will be binding on all parties and their Affiliates, all Buyer Indemnified Persons, all Seller Indemnified Persons and on their respective
successors and assigns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
period to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing arbitration shall be twenty (20)&nbsp;days instead of the 45&nbsp;days set forth in Section&nbsp;12.4(a). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
process for selecting the arbitrator shall be as follows. The Parties shall jointly select a single arbitrator ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>the Environmental

ten (10)&nbsp;days of the selection of the Environmental Neutral, the party initiating dispute resolution shall submit a position paper to the Environmental

then have ten (10)&nbsp;days to submit a position paper in response, setting forth its description of the matters in dispute and its responses to the initiating party's objections and any supporting
documentation. There shall be no depositions or other discovery undertaken in connection with the dispute resolution, and a hearing shall be held by the
Environmental Neutral only if the Environmental Neutral determines that a hearing is necessary. If a party prevails with respect to every position that it asserts to the Environmental Neutral in a
dispute resolution under this Section, it shall be entitled to payment of all of its costs arising from the dispute resolution by the non-prevailing party, which costs shall include, but
not be limited to, consultants' and attorneys' fees and the fees of the Environmental Neutral. Otherwise, the cost of the Environmental Neutral shall be split by the parties, and each party shall bear
their own expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section&nbsp;12.4, the parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to conform all the deadlines set forth herein to any
deadlines established by a Governmental Body with respect to the environmental matter in dispute, and that any Indemnified Person's payment of any costs with respect to such matter prior to the

enunciated by the federal courts situated in the Third Circuit, and all federal rules relating to the admissibility of evidence, including, without limitation, all relevant privileges and the attorney
client work product doctrine, except that the Environmental Laws and cleanup standards of the jurisdiction in which the Real Property is located shall apply to the extent relevant to the Dispute. </FONT></P>

monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which Buyer may be entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce Section&nbsp;10.4 of this Agreement
by a decree of specific performance and such injunctive relief as the court or arbitral tribunal may allow to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Seller
agrees that it will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and that Buyer will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled in arbitration, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted hereunder. </FONT></P>

power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a)&nbsp;no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be
discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b)&nbsp;no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c)&nbsp;no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of
