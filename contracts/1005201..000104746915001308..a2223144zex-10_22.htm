Section 2.02 _Matters Related to Purchased Assets and Non-Assigned Assets_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement

, _however_ , that Seller shall use, and shall cause the Divesting Entities to

, _further_ , that (i) none of Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required to pay money to any third party, commence any

or would continue to, affect the Business after the Closing, such action shall
require the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be

or the Divesting Entities arising thereunder against any Person, including the
right to seek any available remedies or to elect to terminate in accordance
with the terms thereof upon the advice of Purchaser. To the extent that
Purchaser is provided with benefits of any Non-Assigned Asset, Purchaser shall
perform, at the direction of Seller or the applicable Divesting Entity, the
obligations of Seller or the Divesting Entity thereunder. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent that any Assumed
Liability relates to any Non-Assigned Asset that Purchaser is not receiving
the benefit of pursuant to this Section 2.02(b), such Assumed Liability shall
be deemed to be a Retained Liability until such Non-Assigned Asset is
transferred and assigned to Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such
Non-Assigned Asset for which Purchaser is receiving the benefit of pursuant to
Section 2.02(a) is not transferred and assigned to Purchaser at the time
Seller or the applicable Divesting Entity ceases to provide the benefit of

such Assumed Liability relating to the Non-Assigned Assets shall be deemed a
Retained Liability.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending [***]
thereafter (the " _Limited License Period_ "), Seller grants, and shall cause
its Affiliates to grant, to Purchaser and its Affiliates a limited, non-
exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Seller Names, and the
UPCs and, subject to Section 6.09, the NDCs for each of the Products, in each
case solely for the purpose of utilizing the labels and packaging, and
advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials, for the Products as
they exist on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Promptly upon the expiration of the Limited License Period, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, destroy and dispose of all labels
and packaging, and all advertising, marketing, sales and promotional

market, distribute and sell the Products or (ii) manufacture or produce, or
cause or permit any third party to manufacture or produce, any new labels,
packaging or advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials using or
otherwise incorporating any Seller Names in any manner.

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

Seller notifies Purchaser in writing of such breach, Seller may terminate the
license to such Seller Names under Section 6.10(a) by delivery to Purchaser of
a written notice of termination. If Purchaser disputes in good faith the
existence or materiality of an alleged breach specific in a notice provided by
Seller pursuant to this Section 6.10(d), and provides notice to Seller of such
dispute within the [***] period following the date that Seller notified
Purchaser of the breach, Purchaser will not have the right to terminate the
license to such Inventories or finished goods inventory of Products unless and
until the existence of such material breach has been finally determined in
accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of Section 10.11 and
Purchaser fails to cure such breach within [***] following such determination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the transfer of any labels or packaging, or any

Section 6.11 _Seller Use of Transferred IP Rights_. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall and hereby does grant to Seller and its

set forth in this Section 6.11 and Section 6.14.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing, and
for no further consideration (other than reimbursement for out of pocket
expenses incurred in packing or shipping any Purchased Asset), each of the
Parties shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and
deliver such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents
and instruments (including such assignments and other documents, certificates
and instruments for Purchasers filing with the applicable Governmental
Authorities, registries and other recording authorities to record the transfer
of the Transferred IP Rights in accordance with applicable Law) and take such
other commercially reasonable actions as may reasonably be requested to more
effectively assign, convey or transfer to or vest in: (a) Purchaser and its
designated Affiliates, all rights, title and interests in, to and under the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement to
be transferred or assumed at the Closing and (b) Seller, any rights, title or
interests in, to or under any Excluded Asset that may have been transferred to
Purchaser at Closing. Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing, Purchaser
shall prepare any such additional instruments or documents necessary to

Section 6.13 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and its

Agreements and the Post-Transfer Supply Agreement and subject to applicable
Law, for a period commencing on the Closing Date [***] Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Pharmaceutical Affiliates not to, [***] (such activities, "
_Competitive Activity_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.15
shall not restrict Seller or its Affiliates from [***] Seller acknowledges
that (A) the agreements in this Section 6.15 (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ ")
impose a reasonable restraint in light of the activities and business of
Seller and its Affiliates as of the Effective Date and the current business of
Purchaser, Seller and their respective Affiliates; and (B) monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the Restrictive Covenants
and that Purchaser shall therefore be entitled to specific performance of the
Restrictive Covenants (but subject to Section 10.11) to prevent any violations
thereof.

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except as expressly set forth in
Section 6.15(a): [***]

Assets covering all periods and agrees not to seek, through any means, to
benefit from any of Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies which may
provide coverage for claims relating in any way to the Purchased Assets.

 



 

Section 6.17 _Support_. Following the Closing, subject to the terms of any
applicable Ancillary Agreement or the Post-Transfer Supply Agreement,
Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and the Divesting

conducting recalls and/or in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities or
lawsuits involving the Purchased Assets, the Products, the Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, or the Post-Transfer Supply Agreement, in each case for
which the other Party has responsibility under this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the Post-Transfer Supply Agreement, by providing the other Party
and such other Partys legal counsel reasonable access to employees, records,
documents, data, equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes and other
information relating primarily to the Purchased Assets or the Products, as
such other Party may reasonably request, to the extent maintained or under the
possession or control of the requested Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of Purchaser or
Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that
either

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

Party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (a) such
restriction is required by applicable Law, (b) such access or provision of
information would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of
confidentiality obligations to a third party or (c) disclosure of any such
information would result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client
privilege. Subject to the terms of any applicable Ancillary Agreement or the
Post-Transfer Supply Agreement [***] the requesting Party shall reimburse the
other Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid by the other Party to
third parties in performing its obligations under this Section 6.17.

 



 

Section 6.18 _Payments from Third Parties_. In the event that, on or after the
Closing Date, either Party shall receive any payments or other funds due to
the other pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, then the Party receiving such funds shall promptly
forward such funds to the proper Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
there is no right of offset regarding such payments and a Party may not
withhold funds received from third parties for the account of the other Party
in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue under any of the
Transaction Documents.

 



 

Section 6.19 _Resale Exemption Certificates_. At the Closing (or within such
reasonable time thereafter as may be necessary to perfect the resale or other
exemption certificates), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller fully completed and
executed resale exemption certificates or other applicable exemption
certificates for all jurisdictions identified by Seller prior to Closing as
jurisdictions in which inventory is to be transferred and for which resale
exemption certificates are necessary to comply with applicable Law. To the
extent that any jurisdiction refuses to accept any resale exemption
certificate or other applicable exemption certificate provided by Purchaser,
Seller and Purchaser agree that any Transfer Taxes (and related interest and
penalty) assessed by such jurisdiction shall be borne one-half by Purchaser
and one-half by Seller, as provided in Section 2.09 herein.

 



 

Section 6.20 _Returned Goods_. Subject to Section 6.09(b), Purchaser agrees to
adhere to the returned goods policy set forth on _Schedule 6.20_ attached
hereto with respect to all Products received from customers, whether sold by
Purchaser or Seller, to the extent any such returned Product has the name or
any Trademark of Seller or an Affiliate on it.

 



 

Section 6.21 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall deliver an unaudited draft of the Financial Statements to
Purchaser no later than [***] and shall, from and after such date, to the
extent reasonably practicable, consult with Purchaser with respect to such
draft Financial Statements (and give due consideration to any comments
provided by Purchaser with respect thereto).

 



 

(b) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the Financial Statements (including, if
applicable, the Q1 Financials) as soon as practicable after the Effective
Date, together with a customary audit opinion delivered by Sellers
independent registered public accounting firm (which, for avoidance of doubt,
shall not address the Q1 Financials, which shall not be audited) (the " _Audit
Opinion_ ") and a certification executed by the Treasurer, President or Vice
President of Seller (the " _Seller Financial Statement Certification_ "),
which Seller Financial Statement Certification shall certify that such
Financial Statements, as of the time of delivery and as of the Closing: (i)
satisfy the

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from

Statements were prepared in connection with the sale of the Business and are
not intended to be a complete presentation of the Business assets and
liabilities or income statement in conformity with GAAP and (B) the Financial
Statements have been derived from Sellers historical accounting records and
reflect significant allocations and managements estimates of the costs of
products and services provided to the Business by Seller and certain of
Sellers Affiliates and, accordingly, the Financial Statements do not
necessarily represent the net assets and revenues and expenses of the Business
had it been operated as a separate independent entity. If, after Sellers
delivery to Purchaser of a Seller Financial Statement Certification and prior
to the Closing, Seller becomes aware that any certification required to be
contained in such Seller Financial Statement Certification is no longer true
and correct, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written notice of rescission
or revocation of such Seller Financial Statement Certification as promptly as
practicable, but in any event, within [***] thereof.

 



 

(c) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the (i) unaudited Special Purpose

as practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event, within [***]
following the Closing Date and (ii) the Stub Period Financial Statements as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event, by [***]. Such
Special Purpose Financial Statements shall be unaudited but, except in the
case of Stub Period Financial Statements, shall be reviewed by Sellers
independent registered public accounting firm ( _provided_ that no review
report thereon shall be required) and shall be prepared according to a
methodology consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

 



 

(d) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and each Divesting Entity to

properties of Seller, its Affiliates and the Divesting Entities relating
solely to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Products (including
properties, information, assets, books, records, agreements, documents, data,
files and personnel) and (B) reasonable assistance and cooperation, in each
case, as is necessary for any reasonable purpose in connection with the
matters set forth in this Section 6.21(d), including accounting matters and
financial reporting. Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller its reasonable,
customary and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses with respect to
Sellers compliance with this Section 6.21(d).

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation
to provide or cause to be provided [***]

investor presentations, bank information memoranda, offering memoranda and
similar documents required in connection with the Financing and (vii)
otherwise taking, or causing to be taken, all actions and to do, or causing to
be done, all things reasonably necessary to arrange and obtain the Financing

prompt notice of (A) any material breach or default by any party to the

knowledge, (B) the receipt of any written communication with respect to any
actual or potential material breach or default by any party to the Financing
or the Definitive Financing Agreements or any termination of the Financing or
the Definitive Financing Agreements or (C) any dispute or disagreement between

arrangement of the Financing ( _provided_ in all cases that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Seller), which reasonable best efforts shall include (i) furnishing, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the delivery of Purchasers
request therefor to Seller (which notice shall state with specificity the

with the Seller Financial Statement Certification, each, a " _Seller
Certification_ ") that such Required Information provided by Seller is

writing by Seller specifically for use in connection therewith), except, in
each case, insofar as such Losses (A) arose out of or resulted from the common
law fraud, willful misconduct, bad faith, intentional misrepresentation or
gross negligence of Seller or its Representatives, (B) directly resulted from
the breach of any of the obligations of Seller or its Representatives under
this Agreement or (C) that were agreed to in a settlement without the written

to the Knowledge of Seller, any director, officer, agent, or employee of
Seller or any Divesting Entity; and

 



 

(e) any damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of any material

which applicable rules of discovery shall apply), and shall preserve and
retain all such records for the length of time contemplated by its standard

Purchaser shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.30 to disclose any

after the Closing, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents,
representatives, employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ "), from and against any and all Losses to the extent
arising from or relating to (i) any Retained Liability; (ii) any Excluded
Asset; (iii) any breach by Seller of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or any instruments of assignment delivered on or
prior to Closing in accordance therewith; or (iv) any breach of any warranty
or representation of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 7.01 (other than a Seller Required
Information Certification).

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall take, and shall cause the other Purchaser Indemnitees to
take, commercially reasonable actions to mitigate any Loss (including using
commercially reasonable efforts to make claims under applicable insurance
policies) that a Purchaser Indemnitee asserts under this Article VIII upon
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit
the ability of Purchaser and the other Purchaser Indemnitees to incur
reasonable costs and expenses in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) In addition to the indemnity provided by the third sentence of Section
6.22(b), subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, Purchaser agrees to,
from and after the Closing, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents,
representatives, employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ "), from and against any and all Losses to the extent
arising from or relating to (i) any Assumed Liability; (ii) any breach by
Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or

commercially reasonable actions to mitigate any Loss (including using
commercially reasonable efforts to make claims under any applicable insurance
policies) that a Seller Indemnitee asserts under this Article VIII upon
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit
the ability of Seller and the other Seller Indemnitees to incur reasonable
costs and expenses in connection therewith.

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.03 _Notice of Claims_. Any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
claiming that it has suffered or incurred any Loss for which it may be
entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII or the third sentence of
Section 6.22(b) (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice
to the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") of the matter, action, cause of action, claim, demand, fact or other
circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification under this Article VIII
or the third sentence of Section 6.22(b) (each, a " _Claim_ ") may be based.
Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim, such facts and
information as are then reasonably available with respect to such Claim,
including a description of the Losses suffered or incurred by the Indemnified
Party, the amount or estimated amount of such Losses (if known or reasonably
capable of estimation) and the method of computation of such Losses, and a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss
shall have occurred. If any Claim is based on any action, claim, suit or
proceeding (in equity or at law) instituted by a third party with respect to
which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any Loss under this Article VIII
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify (the
" _Third Party Claim Notice_ "), in writing, the Indemnifying Party of such
Third Party Claim and offer to tender to the Indemnifying Party the defense of
such Third Party Claim. A failure by the Indemnified Party to give written
notice of and to offer to tender the defense of any Third Party Claim in a
timely manner pursuant to this Section 8.03 shall not limit the obligation of
the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII, except (a) to the extent such
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby or (b) as provided in
Section 8.05.

 



 

Section 8.04 _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation,
exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
of receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party with
respect to a Third Party Claim, to assume the conduct and control, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party and through counsel of its choosing that is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume or maintain control of the defense of such Third Party Claim and shall
pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i)
such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
Legal Proceeding, (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) such
Third Party Claim seeks monetary damages and the sum of the amount of the
monetary damages is greater than twice the maximum amount from which the
Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this
Agreement, (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on the
advice of counsel, that there is an irreconcilable conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of
such defense or (v) after assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying
Party withdraws from such defense or fails to diligently pursue and maintain
such defense.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party advance written notice of any proposed compromise or
settlement and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

withheld, consent to or enter into any compromise or settlement that commits
the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action or does not
provide for a full and complete written release by the applicable third party
of the Indemnified Party. No Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any
Third Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. No Indemnifying Party may consent to the entry of any judgment that
does not relate solely to monetary damages arising from any such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 8.04(a), the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such
Third Party Claim through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, _provided_
that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to, or is not permitted to
pursuant to Section 8.04(a), control or conduct the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim and, at its own expense, to employ
counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.

 



 

(d) The Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, with
such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim and (ii) reasonable access to employees on a mutually
convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 



 

(e) Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate and to cause their Affiliates to
cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably required after the Closing
Date in connection with any claims conducted by a Taxing Authority relating to
any Taxes with respect to or in relation to any Purchased Asset for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date or, in the case of any Tax period
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date, the portion of such
period ending on the Closing Date (each a " _Tax Contest_ "). Promptly after
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives notice of any Tax Contest,
Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing (which notice shall include copies of
any material notices, correspondence and any other documents received by
Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to such Tax Contest) of the Tax
Contest; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect
Purchasers rights under this Article VIII except to the extent that Seller
has been materially prejudiced by such failure. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, if the Tax Contest relates solely to (i) Sellers Tax Liability
or rights to any refunds (or the liability or rights of Seller) or (ii) a Tax
for which Seller could have an indemnification obligation under this
Agreement, Seller shall have the sole right to conduct, control, defend,
settle or compromise the defense of the Tax Contest at its own expense,
whether the Tax Contest began before or after the Closing Date; and Purchaser
shall provide Seller with all necessary powers of attorney and other necessary
documents and assistance to allow Seller to effectively conduct and control
such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any Claims
conducted by a Taxing Authority against Purchaser that is a Tax Contest,
Purchaser shall have the right to control the defense against such Claim
except that Seller shall have the right to participate in such

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



     

 



 

defense and Purchaser shall not settle or resolve such Claim without the
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 8.05 _Expiration_. If the Closing shall have occurred, all covenants,
agreements, warranties and representations made herein or in any certificate
delivered in accordance herewith shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made
herein or in any certificate delivered in accordance herewith, and all
indemnification obligations under Section 8.01(a)(iii), Section 8.01(a)(iv),
Section 8.02(a)(ii) and Section 8.02(a)(iii) with respect to any such
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements shall (a) in the case of
such representations and warranties other than the Fundamental
Representations, terminate and expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking
damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for any misrepresentation
or inaccuracy with respect thereto, shall be commenced after, the date that is
[***] after the Closing Date, (b) in the case of the Fundamental
Representations, terminate and expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking
damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for any misrepresentation
or inaccuracy with respect thereto, shall be commenced after, the date that is
[***] after the Closing Date, or (c) in the case of any covenants or
agreements, survive indefinitely or for such shorter period of time specified
therein, in each case, unless prior to such date a claim for indemnification
with respect thereto shall have been made, with reasonable specificity, by
written notice given in accordance with Section 8.03.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Article VIII, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any indemnification
obligations for Losses under Section 8.01(a)(iv) or Section 8.02(a)(iii), as
applicable, (a) for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is
less than [***] (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") and (b) in respect of each
individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than
the De Minimis Amount, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
[***] (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which event Seller shall be required to
pay the amount of such Losses that exceeds [***] but only to a maximum amount
equal to [***] (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the De Minimis
Amount, the Threshold Amount and the Cap shall not apply to any Losses arising
or resulting from any breach of any Fundamental Representation; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that the maximum amount of Losses for which Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, shall be liable for under Section 8.01(a)(iii),
8.02(a)(ii) or for any breach of any Fundamental Representation shall in no
event exceed the Purchase Price. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Loss (but not for determining the existence of any breach, misrepresentation
or inaccuracy with respect to any representation or warranty of Seller), any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in any
such representation or warranty shall be disregarded. If Purchaser elects to
Close after receiving written notice from Seller of an uncured Material Loss,
Purchaser shall not be permitted to make a Claim (under this Article VIII or
otherwise) with respect to such uncured Material Loss.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. Except as set forth in the third sentence
of Section 6.22(b), the penultimate sentence of this Section 8.07 and in
Section 10.15, this Article VIII provides the sole recourse and exclusive
means from and after the Closing by which a Party may assert and remedy any
Losses arising under or with respect to this Agreement or any certificate or
instrument of transfer, assignment or assumption delivered under this
Agreement, and Section 10.11 provides the exclusive means by which a Party may
bring actions against the

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

other Party under or with respect to this Agreement or any certificate or
instrument of transfer, assignment or assumption delivered under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit the
liability of any Party hereto for intentional or willful misrepresentation of
material facts which constitutes common law fraud under applicable Laws. With
respect to any Losses arising under or with respect to this Agreement or any
certificate or instrument of transfer, assignment or assumption delivered
under this Agreement, each Party agrees that it shall only seek such Losses
from the other Party, and each Party hereby waives the right to seek Losses
from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, against any Affiliate
of the other Party or any director, officer or employee of the other Party (or
any of its Affiliates).

 



 

Section 8.08 _Indemnity Payments_. In the event that either Party agrees to,
or is determined to have an obligation to, reimburse the other Party for
Losses as provided in this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly
pay such amount to the Indemnified Party in U.S. Dollars via wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified in writing by the
Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Calculation of Damages_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Article VIII, in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers
from its insurance provider(s) any amount in respect of a matter with respect
to which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article
VIII (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include an amount recovered
as a Tax benefit), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full
amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of any amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price
for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.11 _No Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RELIEF MANDATED BY STATUTE OR
ANY BREACH OF SECTION 6.15 OR SECTION 6.26, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR
OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE OTHER PARTY
FOR LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS DAMAGES OR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR MULTIPLIED DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH HEREOF OR ANY LIABILITY RETAINED OR
ASSUMED HEREUNDER; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT BE
CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE RECOVERY IN RESPECT OF ANY LOSS DIRECTLY INCURRED OR
SUFFERED FROM THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

with any of Purchasers covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or
(B) any one or more of the representations or warranties of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement shall prove to have been inaccurate in any
material respect when made and, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), such
failure or inaccuracy would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 7.02 to be satisfied, and Seller shall have given Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity to cure (if capable of being cured prior to the
Closing) any such failure or inaccuracy to so comply before the Closing.

 



 

(ii) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(ii) only if at
the time of termination (A) Seller is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement and (B) Seller has satisfied those conditions set forth in Section
7.01 required to be satisfied by Seller (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing).

 



 

(iii) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if (i) all of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.01 (other than in Section 7.01(k)) shall have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (ii) Seller shall have
materially complied with its covenants in Section 6.22(b), but Purchaser shall
not have received the proceeds of the Financing, (iii) Purchaser shall have
failed to consummate the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in the event such failure occurs more
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, such failure shall not
have been cured within five (5) days after written notice thereof has been
given by Seller to Purchaser, (iv) at the time of termination, Seller is not
in material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or in any Seller Certification (other than Seller
Certifications that have been revoked or rescinded and been replaced with
updated Seller Certifications) and (v) Seller is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing.

 



 

(iv) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller at any time prior to the
Closing, if a final, non-appealable Closing Legal Impediment shall be in
effect; _provided_ , that Seller may not rely upon this Section 9.01(c)(iv) to
terminate this Agreement if Seller shall have failed to use reasonable best
efforts to prevent the occurrence of any such Closing Legal Impediment or to
remove or appeal as promptly as practicable any such Closing Legal Impediment.

 



 

Section 9.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9.01, and with the exception of this Section 9.02, Section 6.04,
Section 6.26 and Article X, this Agreement shall become void and have no
effect and neither Party shall have any liability to the other Party or to
such other Partys Affiliates or Representatives

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

in respect of this Agreement except, for the avoidance of doubt, for the
obligations of the Parties contained in this Section 9.02, Section 6.04,
Section 6.26 and in Article X; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall limit the liability of any Party hereto for intentional or willful
misrepresentation of material facts which constitutes common law fraud under
applicable Laws or for any willful breach whereby the breaching Party both
intended to take or fail to take the action giving rise to the breach and had
knowledge that such action or inaction would constitute a breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements to the contrary, in the event of any termination of this Agreement
by either Party for any reason other than termination by Seller pursuant to
Section 9.01(c)(iii), (i) Purchaser, no later than five (5) Business Days
after such termination, shall send a written instruction to the Escrow Agent
certifying that (A) Purchaser has received a written notice from Seller
terminating (or purporting to terminate) this Agreement other than pursuant to
Section 9.01(c)(iii) or (B) this Agreement has been validly terminated by
Purchaser in accordance with Section 9.01(b), and directing the Escrow Agent
to deliver the Escrow Amount (less the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee)
to Purchaser, (ii) Purchaser and Seller shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to deliver the
amount of the Reverse Termination Fee to Purchaser in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement and (iii) under no circumstances shall Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or their respective creditors, have any interest in, claim to or
right to (including any right to set off any amount against) the Escrow Amount
(or any portion thereof, including the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee).
Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (and each of Purchaser and Seller shall
cause its respective Affiliates not to) deliver any conflicting, contrary or
other instructions (whether written or oral) objecting to or in any way
related to the instructions to the Escrow Agent contemplated in this Section
9.02(b) or Section 9.02(c) or the related transfer or distribution of the
Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) In the event that Seller exercises its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(iii), no later than [***] after notice of such
termination, (i) Purchaser shall send a written instruction to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to deliver the Escrow Amount (less the amount
of the Reverse Termination Fee) to Purchaser and (ii) Purchaser and Seller
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the
Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to
Seventy Three Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($73,500,000) (the "
_Reverse Termination Fee_ ") (it being understood that in no event shall
Seller be entitled to receive the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one (1)
occasion or at all if Purchaser consummates the Transactions). Each of the
Parties acknowledges and agrees that (A) the agreements contained in this
Section 9.02(c) are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement and (B) the
payment by Purchaser of the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty. If
Purchaser fails to promptly pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due, and in
order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a Legal Proceeding against
Purchaser for payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller for any reasonable, customary and documented out-of-pocket
legal and other third party fees and expenses incurred by Seller in connection
with such Legal Proceeding (the " _Additional_

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Expenses_ ") within thirty (30) days of a final non-appealable judgment in
such Legal Proceeding that Purchaser is required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee to Seller.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
if Purchaser fails to effect the Closing due to its inability to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 7.01(k), the sole and exclusive remedy in
connection with termination under Section 9.01(c)(iii) of Seller against
Purchaser or any Financing Source in respect of this Agreement shall be to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(c)(iii) and collect
the Reverse Termination Fee (and, if applicable, the Additional Expenses), and
upon payment of such amount by Purchaser, (i) Purchaser shall have no further
liability or obligation to Seller (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement and (ii)
Seller shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against Purchaser or any Financing Source arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement (or the abandonment or termination thereof).
For the avoidance of doubt, no Financing Source will have any liability to
Seller or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Financing or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise.

 



 

(e) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section
9.01 (other than pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(iii)) and, at such time, a Party
is in material breach of or default under any term or provision hereof, such
termination shall be without prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and all
rights to damages that the other Party may have hereunder.

Section 10.02 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed (a) in the case of an amendment, by Purchaser and Seller and (b) in the
case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 



 

Section 10.03 _Assignment_. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, except that (a) Seller may, without such consent, assign its
rights or obligations to an Affiliate, (b) Purchaser may, without such
consent, assign this Agreement and its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, (i) to one or more of its Affiliates, (ii) in
connection with any transaction the primary purpose of which is to change the
domicile of Purchaser, (iii) after the Closing (or the termination of this
Agreement), in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change of
control or similar transaction of Purchaser, whether by sale of stock, merger,
sale of all or substantially all of Purchasers assets, operation of Law or
otherwise, or (iv) to any lender of Purchaser or purchaser of securities used
to finance the Transactions as collateral security to secure the obligations
of any indebtedness of Purchaser and (c) Purchaser may assign this Agreement
and its rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, with
the prior written consent of Seller (which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), on or after [***] to a third
party at least as creditworthy as Purchaser, in connection with the transfer
or sale of all or substantially all of the Purchased Assets or the Business,
whether by sale of stock, merger, sale of assets, operation of Law or
otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment by either Party
shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any permitted
assignee shall assume all obligations of its assignor under this Agreement.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.03 shall be null and
void.

 



 

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits
and Schedules expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto (which are
hereby incorporated by reference), and the other agreements and certificates
delivered in connection herewith (including the other Transaction Documents
and the Confidentiality Agreement), contains the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the Transactions and supersedes all prior agreements
or understandings between the Parties. Other than the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Transaction Documents are intended to define the full extent of
the legally enforceable agreements, covenants, undertakings, representations
and warranties of the Parties, and no promise, representation or warranty,
written or oral, which is not set forth explicitly in such agreements is
intended by either Party to be legally binding. Each of the Parties
acknowledges that, in deciding to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and to consummate the Transactions, none of them has
relied upon any statements or representations, written or oral, other than
those explicitly set forth herein or therein.

Section 10.05 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of a Party to the
other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

 



 

Section 10.06 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Seller, the Divesting Entities
and the Indemnified Parties, or their successors or permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. The Financing Sources
are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the provisions of
Section 9.02(d), this Section 10.06 and Section 10.10(c).

 



 

Section 10.07 _Reserved_.

 



 

Section 10.08 _Expenses_. The fee owed to the Escrow Agent in accordance with

expenses.

 



 

Section 10.09 _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure for the purposes of the
Section or subSection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and
each other Section and subSection of this Agreement to the extent such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face thereof to be relevant to such
other Section or subSection. The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to

Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or is
required to be disclosed under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; No Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law,
principles or rules of such state, to the extent such principles or rules are
not mandatorily applicable by statute and would permit or require the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) The Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State
courts located in the State of New York for the resolution of all disputes or
controversies between the Parties which, pursuant to applicable Law, are not
subject to the provisions of Section 10.11. Each of the Parties (i) consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any suit, action or
proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions;
(ii) waives any objection that it may have to the laying of venue in any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court; and (iii) agrees that service of
any court paper may be made in such manner as may be provided under applicable
Laws or court rules governing service of process. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, AND AGREE TO CAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from

AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
RELATED AGREEMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party acknowledges
and irrevocably agrees that with respect to any Covered Action, such Party
agrees and shall take (or refrain from taking) such actions as necessary to
procure that (i) any Covered Action shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the county of New York, and
any appellate court thereof, (ii) that service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in Section 10.01 shall be effective service of process against it for
any Covered Action, (iii) to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any Covered Action, and (iv) that a final judgment in any
Covered Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
Nothing in this paragraph shall affect or eliminate any right to serve process
in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY COVERED
ACTION.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Dispute Resolution_. The Parties recognize that a dispute may
arise relating to this Agreement (" _Dispute_ "). Other than with respect to
Third Party Claims, any Dispute, including Disputes that may involve any
Affiliates of a Party, shall be resolved in accordance with this Section
10.11.

 



 

(a) _Mediation_.

 



 

(i) The Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute by
confidential mediation in accordance with the then current _Mediation
Procedure_ of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and
Resolution (" _CPR Mediation Procedure_ ") ( _www.cpradr.org_ ) before
initiating arbitration. The CPR Mediation Procedure shall control, except
where it conflicts with these provisions, in which case these provisions
control. The mediator shall be chosen pursuant to CPR Mediation Procedure. The
mediation shall be held in New York, New York.

 



 

(ii) Either Party may initiate mediation by written notice to the other Party
of the existence of a Dispute. The Parties agree to select a mediator within
twenty (20) days of the notice and the mediation will begin promptly after the
selection. The mediation will continue until the mediator, or either Party,
declares in writing, no sooner than after the conclusion of one full day of a
substantive mediation conference attended on behalf of each Party by a senior
business person with authority to resolve the Dispute, that the Dispute cannot
be resolved by mediation. In no event, however, shall mediation continue more
than sixty (60)

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



     

 



 

days from the initial notice by a Party to initiate meditation unless the
Parties agree in writing to extend that period.

 



 

(iii) Any period of limitations that would otherwise expire between the
initiation of mediation and its conclusion shall be extended until twenty (20)
days after the conclusion of the mediation.

 



 

(b) _Arbitration_.

 



 

(i) If the Parties fail to resolve the Dispute in mediation, and a Party
desires to pursue resolution of the Dispute, the Dispute shall be submitted by
either Party for resolution in arbitration pursuant to the then current CPR
_Non-Administered Arbitration Rules _(" _CPR Rules_ ") ( _www.cpradr.org_ ),
except where they conflict with these provisions, in which case these
provisions control. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York. All
aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential.

 



 

(ii) The arbitrators will be chosen from the CPR Panel of Distinguished
Neutrals, unless a candidate not on such panel is approved by both Parties.
Each arbitrator shall be a lawyer with at least fifteen (15) years experience
with a law firm or corporate law department of over twenty-five (25) lawyers
or who was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction. To the extent that the
Dispute requires special expertise, the Parties will so inform CPR prior to
the beginning of the selection process.

 



 

(iii) The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators, of whom
each Party shall designate one in accordance with the "screened" appointment
procedure provided in CPR Rule 5.4. The chair will be chosen in accordance
with CPR Rule 6.4. If, however, the aggregate award sought by the Parties is
less than [***] and equitable relief is not sought, a single arbitrator shall
be chosen in accordance with the CPR Rules. Candidates for the arbitrator
position(s) may be interviewed by Representatives of the Parties in advance of
their selection, _provided_ that all Parties are represented.

 



 

(iv) The Parties agree to select the arbitrator(s) within forty-five (45) days
of initiation of the arbitration. The hearing will be concluded within nine
(9) months after selection of the arbitrator(s) and the award will be rendered
within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the hearing, or of any post-
hearing briefing, which briefing will be completed by both sides within forty-
five (45) days after the conclusion of the hearing. In the event the Parties
cannot agree upon a schedule, then the arbitrator(s) shall set the schedule
following the time limits set forth above as closely as practical.

 



 

(v) The hearing will be concluded in ten (10) hearing days or less. Multiple
hearing days will be scheduled consecutively to the greatest extent possible.
A transcript of the testimony adduced at the hearing shall be made and shall
be made available to each Party.

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) The arbitrator(s) shall be guided, but not bound, by the _CPR Protocol on
Disclosure of Documents and Presentation of Witnesses in Commercial
Arbitration_ ( _www.cpradr.org_ ) (" _Protocol_ "). The Parties will attempt
to agree on modes of document disclosure, electronic discovery, witness
presentation, etc. within the parameters of the Protocol. If the Parties
cannot agree on discovery and presentation issues, the arbitrator(s) shall
decide on presentation modes and provide for discovery within the Protocol,
understanding that the Parties contemplate reasonable discovery.

 



 

(vii) The arbitrator(s) shall decide the merits of any Dispute in accordance
with the law governing this Agreement, without application of any principle of
conflict of laws that would result in reference to a different law. The
arbitrator(s) may not apply principles such as " _amiable compositeur_ " or "
_natural justice and equity_."

 



 

(viii) The arbitrator(s) are expressly empowered to decide dispositive motions
in advance of any hearing and shall endeavor to decide such motions as would a
United States District Court Judge sitting in the jurisdiction whose
substantive law governs.

 



 

(ix) The arbitrator(s) shall render a written opinion stating the reasons upon
which the award is based. The Parties consent to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the district in which the arbitration is held
for the enforcement of these provisions and the entry of judgment on any award
rendered hereunder. Should such court for any reason lack jurisdiction, any
court with jurisdiction may act in the same fashion.

 



 

(x) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each Party has the right to seek from the appropriate court provisional
remedies such as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin or other
equitable relief to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the _status quo_ ,
preserve its status and priority as a creditor or preserve the subject matter
of the Dispute. Rule 14 of the CPR Rules does not apply to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and together shall
constitute one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Party, it being understood that both Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement, following its execution, may be delivered via
telecopier machine or other form of electronic delivery, which shall
constitute delivery of an execution original for all purposes.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

 



 

 ** _Confidential Information indicated by_** _[***] **has been omitted from
this filing and filed separately with the Securities Exchange Commission.**_

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefore in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage may occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof or thereof and that the Parties may be
entitled to seek a temporary injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof or thereof in any court specified in Section 10.10(b), or to
seek a permanent injunction from the arbitrators in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
