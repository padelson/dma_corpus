upon the surrender of any share of Company Common Stock. If cash payment is
to be made, or shares of Parent Stock issued, to a Person other than the
Person who surrendered the shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be a
condition of payment that the shares of Company Common Stock so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the surrendered shares of Company Common Stock, or establish to the

Following the Effective Time, no dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon the
surrender of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.5 and, with respect
thereto, no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.8. Subject to the effect of applicable
escheat or similar laws and subject to Section 2.10, following the surrender
of any such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.5 there shall be paid to the
holder of the Certificate, (a) any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable (with a
record date and payment date after the Effective Time but prior to the
surrender of shares of Company Common Stock) with respect to shares of Parent
Stock represented by such Certificate and (b) the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.8. No holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Certificate, to vote the

SHARES.   (a) No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock which have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (b) In lieu of any such
fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Stock upon
surrender of all of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Article 2 will be paid an amount in cash (without
interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (a) the
last reported sale price per share of Parent Stock as reported by the Nasdaq
Stock Market on the day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective
Time occurs (or, if Parent Stock does not trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market on
such date, the first date of trading of Parent Stock on the Nasdaq Stock
Market after the Effective Time) by (b) the fractional interest to which such
holder otherwise would be entitled. Such amount in cash shall be deemed to be
substituted for any such fractional share and to constitute a portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to the related shares of Company
Common Stock and shall not reduce, offset or otherwise affect the Cash
Consideration Amount.   2.9 NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Merger Sub, or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any person in respect of any
payments or distributions payable in respect of shares of Parent Stock
issuable in exchange for any unsurrendered Certificate that are delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any shares of Company Common Stock shall not have been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   2.10 TAX
WITHHOLDING. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be

this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts,
if any, as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.   2.11 BOARD REPRESENTATION.
As provided in this Section 2.11, the Stockholders shall be entitled to
designate one person (the "STOCKHOLDERS\' DESIGNEE") for election to
Parent\'s Board of Directors effective as of the Effective Time, subject to

cause the vacancy created thereby to be filled by the Stockholders\'
Designee; provided that the Stockholders shall have delivered notice to

understands and acknowledges that the Parent Stock is being offered and sold

warranties and agreements which the Stockholder makes by signing it and the
applicable limitations upon such Stockholder\'s resale of the shares of

issued to such Stockholder in the Merger is being acquired by such
Stockholder solely for its own account, for investment purposes only, and is

economic risk of the investment for an indefinite period of time. Such
Stockholder understands that Parent may require it to furnish an opinion of
counsel satisfactory to Parent that such sale or transfer is so exempt.  
(e) Such Stockholder is able (i) to bear the economic risk of an investment
in Parent Stock indefinitely, (ii) to hold the shares of Parent Stock
indefinitely, and (iii) to afford a complete loss of this investment. Such

that, in making the decision to acquire the shares of Parent Stock in the
Merger, it has relied solely upon independent investigations made by it
and/or by its representatives, including its own professional tax and other
advisors and that it and such representatives and advisors have been given
the opportunity to ask questions of, and to receive answers from, Parent
concerning this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Merger, and to

Stockholder is not aware of the existence of any fact, circumstance or event
that would provide the basis for any claim by such Stockholder that the

contract, agreement or arrangement or otherwise engaged in any transaction
(a) in violation of any of its Charter Documents, or without obtaining any
vote, approval or consent required thereunder, (b) in violation of any of the
Listed Agreements, or without obtaining any vote, approval or consent of any
Stockholder or any other party thereto (or any group comprised of one or more
of them) required thereunder, or (c) that would trigger or accelerate any
rights of any Stockholder or any other party thereto under any of the Listed
Agreements, in each case except to the extent any of the foregoing has been
validly approved or waived prior to the date hereof.   5.10 REORGANIZATION

and authority to execute and deliver the Reorganization Documents and

thereby were duly and validly approved by all necessary action, corporate or
other, of such Stockholder, and no other proceedings, corporate or other, on
the part of it were necessary to approve the Reorganization Documents and
to consummate the Reorganization. Each of the Reorganization Documents
was duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder to the
extent that it is a party thereto, and each of the Reorganization
Documents constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder to
the extent that it is a party thereto, enforceable against such Stockholder
in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors\' rights generally and limitations on the availability
of equitable remedies.   (b) Neither the execution and the delivery of any
Reorganization Document by such Stockholder nor the consummation by such
Stockholder of the Reorganization, nor compliance by such Stockholder with
any of the terms or provisions thereof, has or will violate any provision of
any of the Charter Documents of such Stockholder.   5.11 CHICKASAW

From and after the Effective Time, each Stockholder agrees that all of its
respective rights with respect to its respective shares of Company Common
Stock arising under each of the Listed Agreements shall terminate and be of
no further force and effect. Each Stockholder agrees that on or prior to the
Closing Date it will execute all such documents as Parent shall reasonably
request in order to terminate all of the Listed Agreements and all of such
Stockholder\'s rights thereunder.   7.6 OTHER ACTIONS.   (a) Subject to
the terms and conditions herein provided and applicable legal requirements,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, as promptly as
practicable, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws
and regulations to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article 8 are
satisfied and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (b) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or permits of, or registration or filing with
or notification to (any of the foregoing being a "CONSENT"), any
Governmental Entity (including the filing of such applications with the FCC
as may be necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.2(j)) or
any other Person required in connection with, and waivers of any
violations, defaults or breaches that may be caused by, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such party.   (c) Each
party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material communication
from the SEC, the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the United
States Department of Justice ("DOJ") or any other Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any
party hereto or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.   (d) Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations or waivers
required under the HSR Act to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, making all filings with the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ and the FTC required in connection therewith (the initial
filing with DOJ and FTC to occur no later than five (5) business days
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement unless mutually agreed
otherwise) and responding as promptly as practicable to all inquiries
received from the DOJ or the FTC for additional information or documentation.
Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the
HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status
of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ. In the event a suit is
threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, or any other federal, state or foreign law or
regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, "ANTITRUST LAWS"), each party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to avoid the filing of or resist or resolve such suit. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such
action as may be required in order to obtain clearance under the HSR Act in
order to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination Date. Parent shall
be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any
Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall
afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In
addition, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take such action as may be required by any federal or state court
of the United States, in any suit brought by any Governmental Entity or any
other person challenging the Merger as violative of the Antitrust Laws in
order to avoid the entry of any permanent injunction or other permanent order
which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger prior to
the Termination Date, and in the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall take promptly any and
all steps (including the appeal thereof or the posting of a bond) within
its control necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order
so as to permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date.   (e) If
Parent is required to take any action in order to comply with this Section
7.6, Parent may take such action concurrently with the closing of the Merger
on the Closing Date, and nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent to
take such action prior to the Closing Date.   7.7 PARENT ANNOUNCEMENTS.
Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other before issuing any press releases or making any public
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with the Nasdaq Stock Market.   7.8
DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) The Parent Parties and the
Company agree that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on
liability existing in favor of any Indemnitee as provided in the Charter
Documents of the Company (and after the Merger the Surviving Corporation) or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnity Agreement disclosed in Section
7.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. For
the purposes of this Section 7.8, (i) an "INDEMNITEE" shall mean any
individual who on or prior to the Effective Time was an officer or director
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the heirs, executors,
trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of any officer or director, and (ii)
"INDEMNITY AGREEMENT" shall mean any agreement which provides for
indemnification by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any
Indemnitee in effect on the date of this Agreement.   (b) From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to
alter, amend or otherwise modify the Charter Documents of the Surviving
Corporation in any manner that adversely affects or otherwise prejudices the
rights of any of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8.   (c)
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation contained in this Section 7.8 shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the
event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section
7.8.   (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 7.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, and for so long thereafter as
any claim asserted prior to such time shall be pending, and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnitee to whom this Section 7.8 applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this Section 7.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.8, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section
7.8).   7.9 PARENT TAX FILING.   (a) Parent and the surviving corporation
agree to file all federal and state income tax returns and reports consistent
with: (i) the Reorganization constituting a transaction described in Section
351(a) of the Code; and (ii) the Merger constituting a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless there has been a
Final Determination with respect to any Stockholder that (i) the
Reorganization did not constitute a transaction described in Section 351(a)
of the Code; or (ii) the Merger did not constitute a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, in which case, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to file their federal and state
income tax returns and reports in a manner consistent with such Final
Determination. Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
Affiliates shall be required to contest any claim by a Governmental Entity
relating to the treatment of the Reorganization as a transaction described in
Section 351(a) of the Code or the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) Each
Stockholder hereby agrees that it will give Parent prompt written notice of
the initiation by any Governmental Entity of any examination, proceeding,
investigation, claim or action that arises out of, or is related directly or
indirectly to, the tax treatment of the Reorganization or the Merger.   (c)
Each Stockholder hereby agrees that it shall have no recourse against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have no liability or obligation to any Stockholder as a
result of, the failure of (i) the Reorganization to constitute a transaction
described in Section 351(a) of the Code, or (ii) the Merger to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   7.10
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE.   (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence,
or non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause (A) any representation
or warranty made by it and contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (B) any covenant, condition
or agreement made by it contained in this Agreement not to be complied with
or satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement made
by it and to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.10 shall
not have any effect for the purpose of determining the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.   (b) Each of
Parent and the Company agrees to promptly provide the other with copies of
any and all material correspondence between such party and Sprint PCS
relating to the operation of its business during the period prior to the
Effective Time.   7.11 INVESTIGATION AND AGREEMENT BY THE PARTIES; NO
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.   (a) Each of the Parent Parties, on
the one hand, and the Company Parties, on the other, acknowledges and agrees
that it has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon,
has formed an independent judgment concerning, the other party and its
Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and such party has
requested such documents and information from the other party as such party
considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each of
the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the Company Parties, on the
other hand, acknowledges and agrees that it has had an opportunity to ask
all questions of and receive answers from the other party with respect to
any matter such party considers material in determining whether to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement.   (b) Each of the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the
Company Parties, on the other, agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by the other party that are expressly set forth in
Article 3, Article 4 and Article 5 of this Agreement, as applicable, neither
the other parties nor any of their representatives or Affiliates have made
and shall not be deemed to have made to such party or to any of
its representatives or Affiliates any representation or warranty of any
kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party agrees
that except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the other
parties nor any of their Affiliates make or have made any representation
or warranty to such party or to any of its representatives or Affiliates
with respect to:   (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or
budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component
thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the
other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or
affairs of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to such party or its counsel,
accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or Affiliates; and   (ii)
any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to such party or its counsel, accountants,
advisors, lenders, representatives or Affiliates with respect to the other
party or any of its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of
the other party or any of its Subsidiaries.   7.12 RESIGNATIONS. At Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Parent written resignations of each member of
the Board of Directors of the Company and each officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries other than those officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
designated by Parent at least seven days prior to the Effective Time and each
manager of SWGP, L.L.C. and SWLP, L.L.C.   7.13 CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS.   (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent shall continue to provide individuals who are employed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and who remain employed with
the Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (the "AFFECTED EMPLOYEES"), for so
long as such Affected Employees remain employed by Parent or any Subsidiary
of Parent, employee benefits (other than equity compensation) pursuant
to employee benefits plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained
by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent providing coverage and benefits, which
in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to employees
of Parent in positions comparable to positions held by Affected Employees
with Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time after the Effective Time.
For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in all benefits
provided to Affected Employees (and covered dependents), Affected Employees
will be credited with their years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and prior employers to the extent service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries and prior employers was taken into account under plans of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Amounts paid in the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs by Affected Employees (and covered
dependents) under any medical plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall
after the Effective Time be taken into account in applying deductible
and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the medical plan provided as of
the Effective Time to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid
under such medical plan. Parent will, or will cause a Subsidiary of Parent
to, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Affected Employees (and covered dependents) under any
welfare benefit plans that such persons may be eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect with respect to such persons and that have not been
satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for the
Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (b) Following
the Closing Date, Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to reimburse Chickasaw for all welfare benefit plan expenses paid
by Chickasaw on behalf of employees of the Company (and covered dependents)
who participate in any Company welfare benefit plan that is maintained by
Chickasaw in which Company employees participate (each, a "COMPANY WELFARE
PLAN"), provided such expenses are attributable to claims incurred under a
Company Welfare Plan on or before the Closing Date. Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent shall make any such reimbursement to Chickasaw within 15 days of
notice from Chickasaw that such amounts are payable. This reimbursement
provision shall apply only to welfare benefit expenses actually paid by
Chickasaw and not otherwise covered by third-party insurance maintained by
Chickasaw (including any stop-loss coverage). Except as otherwise provided in
the following sentence, a claim is deemed to have been incurred when services
relating to the claim were performed. In the case of an individual who is
hospitalized on the Closing Date, all claims relating to such
hospitalization (including, without limitation, hospital charges and
physician fees) shall be deemed to be incurred on or before the Closing
Date.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.13 to the contrary,
but subject to Section 7.13(e), if the Closing Date shall occur prior to
April 1, 2001, Affected Employees (and covered dependents) shall, until April
1, 2001, continue to participate and be provided benefits under
Company Welfare Plans. Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent shall reimburse
Chickasaw for welfare benefit expenses attributable to such post Closing
Date participation in the same manner as described in Section 7.13(b), but
with April 1, 2001 being substituted for the Closing Date. In addition,
Parent shall indemnify and hold Chickasaw harmless in respect of any
Damages arising solely out of such post Closing Date participation to the
extent such Damages were not reimbursed pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.13 shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any director, officer or
employee or former director, officer or employee (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation in respect of continued employment for any specified
period of any nature or kind whatsoever.   (e) The Company covenants and
agrees that, if requested in writing by Parent at least five days prior to
the Effective Time, it will terminate, effective as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any Company Plan.   7.14 BORROWED MONEY. Except to the
extent that the lenders thereunder have otherwise agreed, at the Closing,
Parent, or a Subsidiary of Parent, shall cause all Indebtedness of the
Company reflected in the payoff letters delivered pursuant to Section 2.4 to
be paid in full.   7.15 FEES. At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay in full all legal fees and expenses of the
Company\'s counsel, Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., and financial advisory fees of
the Company\'s financial advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc., that have
been incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger and
the Reorganization, in each case, to the extent set forth on Schedules
7.15(a) and 7.15(b).   7.16 VOTE BY STOCKHOLDERS. By their execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of the Stockholders does hereby adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger. On or before the date provided in Section
2.3 for the Closing to occur, (a) Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with the
DGCL and (b) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to amend its certificate of
incorporation to include a provision substantially similar to Article Nine of
the Company\'s certificate of incorporation.   7.17 NON-FOREIGN STATUS OF
STOCKHOLDERS. Each Stockholder shall deliver a certificate (on Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 or suitable substitute form as may be requested by
Parent\'s counsel) on its non-foreign status at the Closing.   7.18
ASSIGNMENT OF LEASE AND LICENSES.   (a) Prior to the Closing, at the request
of Parent and in accordance with Section 7.1, (i) the Company shall provide
to Parent and to Parent\'s officers, employees, financial advisors, legal
counsel, accountants, consultants and other representatives access to all
Tower Leases, leases for Leased Premises and the FCC licenses described
on Section 3.6(b) to the COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE for the purpose of
Parent taking such action as may be necessary, at its sole cost and expense,
to transfer all Tower Leases, leases for Leased Premises and such FCC
licenses immediately after the Effective Time to a newly formed Subsidiary or
newly formed Subsidiaries of Southwest PCS, L.P. and (ii) the Company shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide reasonable assistance to Parent
in connection with such transfers; provided that nothing in this
Section 7.18(a) shall (x) require the Company to prepare any documents
or instruments or otherwise pay any consent fees, filing fees, or
other amounts to any third party, (y) obtain any consent or amendment to
any financing agreement or arrangement or (z) amend the terms and conditions
of any other agreement. Any action taken by Parent under this Section
7.18(a) shall not constitute the basis for asserting that a breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company has occurred or the
assertion that any closing condition under Article 8 has not been
fulfilled.   (b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
and continuing until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the Closing, all filings, consents, approvals,
authorizations, acknowledgements and other documents (including, in the case
of any such items that may be in existence today but in the possession of
other Persons such as lessors under the Tower Leases, obtaining copies
thereof) as shall be necessary for Parent to conduct a review for purposes of
verifying compliance with the items required on the National Environmental
Protection Act checklist with respect to all towers and tower sites leased,
licensed or otherwise utilized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
the conduct of their business.   7.19 TRANSFER OF COMPANY RECORDS. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall, and following the Closing Chickasaw shall,
cooperate with and assist Parent in transferring after the Effective Time or
causing to be transferred to Parent after the Effective Time any files,
books, records or other documents relating to the business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that are the property of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, that are located on premises which will not be occupied
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing and that are
not otherwise in the possession of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   7.20 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent (at Parent\'s sole
cost and expense), on the one hand, or the Stockholders, on the other.  
7.21 CREDIT AGREEMENT. No later than 11:59 a.m. Central Standard Time on
March 30, 2001, Parent shall cause the condition in Section 8.2(k) to
be satisfied.   7.22 CHICKASAW OBLIGATIONS.   (a) Except as set forth in

Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under Section 10.2 of written
notice of a claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding against it
(a "THIRD-PARTY CLAIM"), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against any Stockholder (an "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY"), give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
thereof, but the failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such
action is materially prejudiced thereby. In case any such action or
proceeding shall be brought against an Indemnified Party and it shall give
notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
extent that it shall wish (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a party
to such action or proceeding and the Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Party of its financial capacity to defend such proceeding and provide
indemnification with respect to such proceeding) to assume the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party and,
after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to such Indemnified Party under such Section for any fees or other
expenses of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
action or proceeding, in each case, subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, so long as the Indemnifying
Party is diligently defending the same. If an Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of such action or proceeding, (a) the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in the defense thereof, (b)
no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying
Party without the Indemnified Party\'s consent unless (i) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of
any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against
the Indemnified Party, (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (iii) such judgment
or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability in respect of such action or proceeding and (c) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement thereof effected without its consent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of any action or proceeding and it does not, within 10 business
days after the Indemnified Party\'s notice is given, give notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination made in such action or
(if the Indemnifying Party was entitled to but did not assume the defense of
such action or proceeding) any compromise or settlement thereof effected in
good faith by the Indemnified Party. As to any such action or proceeding as
to which the Indemnifying Party was not entitled to assume the
defense thereof, no compromise or settlement of any such action or proceeding
may be effected by an Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying
Party\'s consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.   10.4
PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION - OTHER CLAIMS. A claim for indemnification for
any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the
party from whom indemnification is sought.   10.5 CONTRIBUTION. The
Stockholders hereby agree that, as among the Stockholders, the obligations
and liabilities arising under Section 10.2(a), 10.2(b), 10.2(d) and 10.2(f)
shall be borne among the Stockholders based upon each Stockholder\'s Company
Ownership Percentage, and that each Stockholder shall have the right to seek
contribution from the Stockholders with respect to such obligations. No
Stockholder shall not have a right of contribution from any of the other
Stockholders in respect of its obligations and liabilities under Sections
10.2(c), 10.2(e), 10.2(g), 10.2(h), 10.2(i), or 10.2(j), as the case may
be.   10.6 SATISFACTION OF LIABILITY. Any Stockholder may satisfy
its liability under this Article 10 by (a) delivering shares of Parent
Stock valued at the Parent Stock Price or (b) cash payments, at the sole
option of such party.   10.7 EXCLUSIVITY. From and after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of this Article 10 shall be the exclusive remedy
that may be asserted against any Stockholder by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates for any loss, expense, damage,
deficiency, liability, claim or obligation, including investigative costs,

pursuant to the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, together
with any shares of Common Stock or other securities issued as a dividend on

distributable on, or with respect to, or in substitution for such Registrable
Shares; provided, however, that Registrable Shares shall not include any
shares of Common Stock or other securities (a) the sale of which by a Holder
has been registered pursuant to the Securities Act and which shares have been
sold pursuant to such registration, (b) which have been sold pursuant to Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act or (c) which are eligible to be sold
without restriction as contemplated by Rule 144(k).   "REGISTRATION

"SHELF REGISTRATION" shall have the meaning provided in Section 2.1
hereof.   "SUSPENSION NOTICE" shall have the meaning provided in Section
2.4 hereof.   ARTICLE 2   REGISTRATION RIGHTS   2.1 SHELF REGISTRATION.
Parent agrees that it shall file with the SEC the Registration Statement
pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act (a "SHELF REGISTRATION") covering
the offer and resale by the Holders of all the Registrable Shares and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration to be
declared effective by the SEC within six months after the Closing. Parent
agrees that it will not knowingly engage in any transaction that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially delay beyond the date that
is six months after the effective time of the Merger, the effectiveness of
the Shelf Registration. The offer and resale of such shares shall be pursuant
to a plan of distribution substantially similar to that attached as EXHIBIT A
hereto; provided that (a) in no event shall such plan of distribution include
an underwritten public offering and (b) prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, each Holder agrees that it shall limit sales under the Shelf
Registration of its Registrable Shares to an amount that shall not exceed 50%
of the Registrable Shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the
definition of Registrable Shares) initially held by such Holder following the
effective time of the Merger. Subject to Section 2.4, Parent shall be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration until the
earlier of (i) such time as all of the Registrable Shares have been resold,
or (ii) such time as all of the Holders can sell all of the Registrable
Shares without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act
(the "EFFECTIVE PERIOD"); provided that, at any time when there is
no registration statement filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 415 that
is effective with the SEC other than the Shelf Registration, Parent shall
not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration
after the second anniversary of the Closing Date as to any Registrable
Shares held by a Holder that otherwise could then be sold pursuant to Rule
144(k), but may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) because the Holder(s) of
such shares is an "affiliate" (as such term is defined in Rule 144 under
the Securities Act) solely because such Holder is the beneficial owner
of additional shares of Common Stock acquired not in connection with
the Merger, which has caused such Holder to be deemed an affiliate for
purposes of Rule 144. Each Holder agrees to furnish promptly to Parent in
writing all information requested by Parent for inclusion in the
Registration Statement (including the intended method of disposition of the
Registrable Shares held by such Holder) or required from time to time to be
disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to Parent by
such Holder not misleading.   2.2 PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION.   (a) If at any
time during the Effective Period Parent  proposes to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act  with respect to an underwritten offering
of its equity securities  for its own account or for the account of another
Person or  Persons (other than a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 
(or any substitute form, respectively, that may be adopted by the  SEC)),
Parent shall give written notice of such proposed filing to  the Holders at
the addresses set forth in the share register of  Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event less  than 10 days before the
anticipated filing date), undertaking to  provide each Holder the opportunity
to register on the same terms  and conditions all or any portion of such
Holder\'s Registrable  Shares (a "PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION"). Each Holder will
have ten  business days after receipt of any such notice to notify Parent
as  to whether it wishes to participate in a Piggyback Registration; 
provided that should a Holder fail to provide timely notice to  Parent, such
Holder will forfeit any rights to participate in the  Piggyback Registration
with respect to such proposed offering. If  Parent shall determine in its
sole discretion not to register or  to delay the proposed offering, Parent
may, at its election,  provide written notice of such determination to the
Holders and  (i) in the case of a determination not to effect the proposed 
offering, shall thereupon be relieved of the obligation to  register such
Registrable Shares in connection therewith, and (ii)  in the case of a
determination to delay a proposed offering, shall  thereupon be permitted to
delay registering such Registrable  Shares for the same period as the delay
in respect of the proposed  offering. As between Parent and the Selling
Holders, Parent shall  be entitled to select the underwriters in connection
with any  Piggyback Registration.   (b) If any Person (including Parent)
requests, pursuant  to Section 2.2 or in connection with similar piggyback 
registration rights, that Registrable Shares be included in a  registration
statement for an underwritten offering and Parent  shall determine, based
upon advice of the managing underwriter or  underwriters, that the inclusion
of such Registrable Shares would  materially and adversely affect the price
or success of the  offering (a "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"), then to the
extent  necessary to eliminate such Material Adverse Effect, Parent will 
include in such registration (i) first, (x) if the proposed  offering is for
a primary issuance by Parent, the shares of Common  Stock that Parent
proposes to sell for its own account, or (y), if  the proposed offering is
the result of a demand registration right  held by another Person, the shares
of Common Stock that such  Person proposes to sell for its own account, and
(ii) second, as  to each Holder, only a portion of the remaining shares to
be  registered equal to the ratio which such Holder\'s requested shares 
bears to the total number of shares requested to be included in  such
registration statement by all Persons (other than the Person  or Persons
initiating such registration request) who have  requested that their shares
be included in such registration  statement. If as a result of the provisions
of this Section 2.2(b)  any Holder shall not be entitled to include all
Registrable Shares  in a registration that such Holder has requested to be
so  included, such Holder may withdraw such Holder\'s request to  include
Registrable Shares in such registration statement prior to  its
effectiveness.   (c) No Holder may participate in any Piggyback 
Registration hereunder unless such Holder (x) agrees to sell such  Holder\'s
Registrable Shares on the basis provided in any  underwriting arrangements
approved by Parent, (y) completes and  executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities,  underwriting agreements, and other documents
reasonably required  under the terms of such underwriting arrangements or
otherwise in  connection with such Piggyback Registration; and (z) agrees to
pay  its pro-rata share of all Selling Expenses (including all fees and 
expenses of its own counsel if any), provided, however, that no  such Holder
shall be required to make any representations or  warranties in connection
with any such registration other than  representations and warranties as to
(i) such Holder, (ii) such  Holder\'s ownership of his or its Registrable
Shares to be sold or  transferred free and clear of all liens, (iii) such
Holder\'s power  and authority to effect such transfer and its intended
method of  distribution, and (iv) such matters pertaining to compliance
with  securities laws and other applicable laws and governmental rules  and
regulations, if any, as may be reasonably requested; provided  further,
however, that the obligation of any such Holder to  indemnify pursuant to any
such underwriting arrangements shall be  individual as to itself, not joint,
among such Holders selling  securities, and the liability of each such Holder
will be in  proportion to (in the case where more than one Holder is
liable),  and provided further that such liability will be limited to, the 
net amount received by such Holder from the sale of his or its  Registrable
Shares pursuant to such registration.   2.3 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. In
connection with any registrations of Registrable Shares pursuant to Sections
2.1 or 2.2 hereof (subject to Section 2.2(a)), Parent will:   (a) prepare
and file with the SEC a registration  statement on any appropriate form under
the Securities Act with  respect to the Registrable Shares included therein
and, except as  otherwise provided in Section 2.1, use its reasonable efforts
to  cause such registration statement to become effective;   (b) prepare
and file with the SEC such amendments,  post-effective amendments, and
supplements to the registration  statements and the prospectuses used in
connection therewith as  may be necessary to keep the registration statements
effective  for, in the case of the Shelf Registration, the Effective Period 
and, in the case of a Piggyback Registration, such period as may  be
specified by the underwriting agreement;   (c) comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with  respect to the disposition of all securities covered
by the  registration statements during such periods in accordance with the 
intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth  in the
registration statements;   (d) furnish to each Holder of Registrable Shares,
and, if  applicable, each underwriter of securities being registered, such 
number of copies of the registration statements, each amendment  and
supplement thereto, the prospectus included in the  registration statements
(including each preliminary prospectus),  any documents incorporated by
reference therein and such other  documents as such Holder may reasonably
request in order to  facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Shares
owned by such  Holder (it being understood that, subject to Section 2.4 and
the  requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities 
laws, Parent consents to the use of the prospectus and any  amendment or
supplement thereto (in each case in the form filed by  Parent pursuant to the
Securities Act and delivered to such Holder  for distribution) by each Holder
and, if applicable, each  underwriter, in connection with the offering and
sale of the  Registrable Shares covered by the registration statement of
which  such prospectus, amendment or supplement is a part);   (e) use
reasonable efforts to register or qualify such  Registrable Shares under such
other securities or blue sky laws of  such jurisdictions as the Holders or,
if applicable, the managing  underwriter, reasonably request to the extent
such registration or  qualification is required; use reasonable best efforts
to keep  each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) 
effective during the period in which the registration statements  are
required to be kept effective; and do any and all other acts  and things
which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to  enable each Holder to
consummate the disposition of the  Registrable Shares owned by such Holder in
such jurisdictions  (provided, however, that Parent will not be required to
(i)  qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it  would
not otherwise be required to qualify but for this  subparagraph, (ii) consent
to general service of process in any  such jurisdiction), or (iii) subject
itself to taxation in any  such jurisdiction;   (f) promptly notify each
Holder and, if applicable, each  underwriter, and (if requested by any such
Person(s)) confirm such  notice in writing (i) when a prospectus or any
prospectus  supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed and, with 
respect to a registration statement or any post-effective  amendment, when
the same has become effective, (ii) of the  issuance by any state securities
or other regulatory authority of  any order suspending the qualification or
exemption from  qualification of any of the Registrable Shares under state 
securities or "blue sky" laws or the initiation of any proceedings  for that
purpose, and (iii) of the happening of any event which  makes any statement
made in a registration statement or related  prospectus untrue in any
material respect or which requires the  making of any changes in such
registration statement, prospectus  or documents so that they will not
contain any untrue statement of  a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not  misleading, and subject to Section 2.4, as soon as
possible  thereafter, prepare and file with the SEC (and deliver such
filing  to each Holder) and furnish a supplement or amendment to such 
prospectus so that, as thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of  such
Registrable Shares, such prospectus will not contain any  untrue statement of
a material fact or omit a material fact  necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading;   (g) make generally available to Parent\'s securityholders  an
earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a)  of the
Securities Act no later than 30 days after the end of the  12-month period
beginning with the first day of Parent\'s first  fiscal quarter commencing
after the effective date of a  registration statement, which earnings
statement shall cover said  12-month period, and which requirement will be
deemed to be  satisfied if Parent timely files complete and accurate
information  on Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K under the Exchange Act and
otherwise  complies with Rule 158 under the Securities Act;   (h) promptly
incorporate in a prospectus supplement or  post-effective amendment in
connection with the Shelf Registration  such information as any Holder
reasonably requests to be included  therein (including without limitation the
naming of additional  Holders therein and specifying the number of
Registrable Shares  held by each such Holder), and promptly make all required
filings  of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;   (i)
cooperate with the Holders and, if applicable, the  underwriters, to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of  certificates (which shall
not bear any restrictive legends unless  required under applicable law)
representing securities sold under  any registration statement, and enable
such securities to be in  such denominations and registered in such names as
the managing  underwriter or such Holders may request and keep available
and  make available to Parent\'s transfer agent prior to the  effectiveness
of such registration statement a supply of such  certificates;   (j) to the
extent provided to Parent or the underwriters,  furnish to each Holder a
signed counterpart of (i) an opinion or  opinions of counsel to Parent, and
(ii) a comfort letter or  comfort letters from Parent\'s independent public
accountants, each  in customary form and covering such matters of the type 
customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters, as the case  may be, as
the Holders or managing underwriter reasonably  requests;   (k) use its
best efforts to cause the Registrable Shares  included in the Shelf
Registration, and use all its reasonable  best efforts to cause the
Registrable Shares included in any other  registration statement, to be (i)
listed on each securities  exchange, if any, on which securities of the same
class issued by  Parent are then listed, or (ii) authorized to be quoted
and/or  listed (to the extent applicable) on the Nasdaq Stock Market if  the
securities of the same class of Parent as the Registrable  Shares are so
authorized;   (l) provide a CUSIP number for the Registrable Shares 
included in any registration statement not later than the  effective date of
such registration statement;   (m) cooperate with each Holder and, if
applicable, each  underwriter, participating in the disposition of such
Registrable  Shares and their respective counsel in all reasonable respects
in  connection with any filings required to be made with the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD");   (n) during the period
when the prospectus is required to  be delivered under the Securities Act,
file within the required  time periods all documents required to be filed by
Parent with the  SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange  Act;   (o) notify each Holder promptly of any request by the
SEC  for the amending or supplementing of such registration statement  or
prospectus or for additional information; and   (p) advise each Holder,
promptly after it shall receive  notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the
issuance of any stop  order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of such
registration  statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding
for  such purpose and promptly use all commercially reasonable efforts  to
prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its  withdrawal at the
earliest possible moment if such stop order  should be issued.   2.4
SUSPENSION OF DISPOSITIONS; HOLDBACK AGREEMENTS.   (a) Each Holder agrees
that, upon receipt of any notice  (a "SUSPENSION NOTICE") from Parent of the
happening of any event  of the kind described in Section 2.3(f)(iii) (and
such event is  not otherwise attributable to a matter that is contemplated
by  Section 2.4(b)), such Holder will forthwith discontinue  disposition of
Registrable Shares pursuant to any prospectus until  such Holder\'s receipt
of the copies of the supplemented or amended  prospectus, or until it is
advised in writing (the "ADVICE") by  Parent that the use of the prospectus
may be resumed, and has  received copies of any additional or supplemental
filings which  are incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so 
directed by Parent, such Holder will deliver to Parent all copies,  other
than permanent file copies then in such Holder\'s possession,  of the
prospectus covering such Registrable Shares current at the  time of receipt
of such notice. Parent shall use its reasonable  best efforts and take such
actions as are necessary to render the  Advice as soon as possible.   (b)
At any time, Parent may suspend sales under the Shelf  Registration and
refuse to permit any Holder to resell any  Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Shelf Registration if  suspension of the sale of the Registrable Shares under
the Shelf  Registration is deemed necessary by Parent, in its good faith 
judgment, as a result of the existence of a matter that Parent has 
determined would not be in the best interest of Parent to disclose  at such
time or a material fact the disclosure of which would have  a material
adverse effect on any proposal or plan by Parent or any  of its Subsidiaries
to engage in any acquisition or sale of assets  (other than in the ordinary
course of business) or any merger,  consolidation, tender offer, securities
offering or other  significant transaction. In such an event, Parent shall
provide  written notice to the Holders of any such suspension promptly 
after Parent makes such determination, and each Holder agrees to  keep the
fact of its receipt of such notice confidential if  requested by Parent in
such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  (1) Parent shall only be
entitled to exercise its right to suspend  sales under the Shelf Registration
pursuant to the second  immediately preceding sentence three times in any
12-month period  following the effective date of the Shelf Registration, (2)
in no  event may any one period for which sales are suspended under the 
Shelf Registration pursuant to the second immediately preceding  sentence
exceed sixty (60) consecutive days, and (3) in no event  shall the aggregate
number of days for which sales are suspended  under the Shelf Registration in
any 12-month period following the  effective date of the Shelf Registration
pursuant to the second  immediately preceding sentence exceed one hundred
twenty (120). In  addition to the foregoing, Parent may suspend resales under
the  Shelf Registration at any time and from time to time to the extent 
deemed necessary by Parent, in its sole discretion, in connection  with the
filing of a post-effective amendment to the Registration  Statement for the
purpose of including information contained in  any report or statement filed
or to be filed by Parent under the  Exchange Act (provided that in no event
shall the period of such  suspension (i) begin prior to the filing date and
(ii) end later  than the effective date, in each case, of such post-
effective  amendment). Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to 
cause any such amendment to be declared effective as promptly as  possible
and to promptly notify the Holders following such time as  Parent has been
advised by the SEC that it has declared such  amendment effective. Each
Holder hereby covenants and agrees that  it will not dispose of any
Registrable Shares pursuant to the  Shelf Registration during the periods for
which sales under the  Shelf Registration have been suspended as set forth in
this  Section 2.4(b) or until such earlier time as Parent shall have 
notified the Holders in writing that sales may resume under the  Shelf
Registration.   (c) In connection with any underwritten offering  of
Registrable Shares made during the Effective Period, each  Holder hereby
agrees, at the request of the underwriters, to enter  into a customary
holdback agreement with respect to such Holder\'s  Registrable Shares,
provided, however, that the terms of such  holdback agreement shall be no
less favorable than any holdback  agreement executed by any other holders of
securities of the  Company in connection with such underwritten offering.  
2.5 REGISTRATION EXPENSES. Any expenses incident to Parent\'s performance of
or compliance with this Agreement, which may include without limitation (i)
all registration and filing fees, (ii) all fees and expenses associated with
filings required to be made with the NASD, as may be required by the rules
and regulations of the NASD, (iii) fees and expenses of compliance with
securities or "blue sky" laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel in connection with "blue sky" qualifications of the Registrable
Shares), (iv) rating agency fees, (v) printing expenses (including expenses
of printing certificates for the Registrable Shares in a form eligible for
deposit with Depository Trust Company and of printing prospectuses if the
printing of prospectuses is requested by a Holder), (vi) messenger and
delivery expenses, (vii) Parent\'s internal expenses (including without
limitation all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing
legal or accounting duties), (viii) the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any listing of the Registrable Shares, (ix) fees and expenses
of counsel for Parent and its independent certified public accountants, (x)
securities acts liability insurance (if Parent elects to obtain such
insurance), (xi) the fees and expenses of any special experts retained by
Parent in connection with such registration, and (xii) the fees and expenses
of other Persons retained by Parent ("REGISTRATION EXPENSES") will be borne
by Parent; provided that in no event shall Registration Expenses include any
underwriting fees, discounts or commissions, selling fees or commissions,
transfer taxes or the fees and expenses of counsel for any Holder or for the
Holders (collectively, "SELLING EXPENSES").   2.6 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a)
Parent agrees to indemnify and reimburse, to the  fullest extent permitted by
law, each Holder, and each of its  employees, officers, and directors and
each Person who controls  such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the  Exchange Act) and any agent or investment advisor thereof 
(collectively, the "HOLDER AFFILIATES") (i) against any and all  losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, joint or  individual (including,
without limitation, any legal or other  expenses incurred in connection with
defending or investigating  any such action or claim except as limited by
Section 2.6(c),  based upon, arising out of or resulting from any untrue or
alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration 
statement or any amendment thereof, prospectus, or preliminary  prospectus
relating to the offer and sale of Registrable Shares or  any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or  alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, (ii)  against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage, and expense  whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the
aggregate amount  paid in settlement (effected with Parent\'s consent) of
any  litigation or investigation or proceeding by any governmental  agency
or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim  whatsoever based upon,
arising out of or resulting from any such  untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or  omission, and (iii) against any and all costs
and expenses  (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) as may
be  reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing, or defending  against
any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any  governmental agency or
body, commenced or threatened, or any claim  whatsoever based upon, arising
out of or resulting from any such  untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or  omission, to the extent that any such expense or cost is
not paid  under clause (i) or (ii) above; except insofar as the same are 
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished  in
writing to Parent by or on behalf of such Holder or any Holder  Affiliate
expressly for use in the preparation of any registration  statement or any
amendment thereof, prospectus, or preliminary  prospectus relating to the
offer and sale of Registrable Shares or  any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto. The reimbursements  required by this Section 2.6(a) will be made by
periodic payments  during the course of the investigation or defense, as and
when  bills are received or expenses incurred.   (b) In connection with any
registration statement in  which a Holder is participating, each such Holder
will furnish to  Parent in writing such information and affidavits as
Parent  reasonably requests for use in connection with any such 
registration statement or prospectus and, to the fullest extent  permitted by
law, each such Holder will indemnify and reimburse  Parent and its directors
and officers and each Person who controls  Parent (within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange  Act) against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, and  expenses (including, without limitation, any legal
or other  expenses) reasonably incurred in connection with defending or 
investigating any such claim except as limited by Section 2.6(c),  based
upon, arising out of or resulting from any untrue statement  or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the  registration statement
or any amendment thereof, prospectus, or  any preliminary prospectus relating
to the offer and sale of  Registrable Shares or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto  or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to  be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not  misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or 
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made  in
reliance upon and in conformity with any information or  affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder or any of its  Holder Affiliates
specifically for use in the preparation of the  registration statement or any
amendment thereof, prospectus, or  any preliminary prospectus relating to the
offer and sale of  Registrable Shares or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto;  provided that the obligation to indemnify will be individual as
to  each Holder, not joint, among such Holders, and the liability of  each
such Holder will be in proportion to (in the case where more  than one Holder
is liable), and provided further that such  liability will be limited to, the
net amount received by such  Holder from the sale of Registrable Shares
pursuant to such  registration statement; provided, however, that such Holder
shall  not be liable in any such case to the extent that prior to the 
filing of any such registration statement or prospectus or  amendment thereof
or supplement thereto, such Holder has furnished  in writing to Parent
information expressly for use in such  registration statement or prospectus
or any amendment thereof or  supplement thereto which corrected or made not
misleading  information previously furnished to Parent.   (c) Any Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder will  (i) give prompt written notice to
the indemnifying party of any  claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification (provided  that the failure to give such notice shall not
limit the rights of  such Person except to the extent that the indemnifying
party is  materially prejudiced thereby, and in no event shall such failure 
relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability that it  may have to
such indemnified party) and (ii) unless such  indemnified party has been
advised by counsel in writing that a  conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying  parties may exist with respect to such claim,
permit such  indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with 
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;  provided, however,
that any Person entitled to indemnification  hereunder shall have the right
to employ separate counsel and to  participate in the defense of such claim,
but the fees and  expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such 
indemnified Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has expressly  agreed in
writing to pay such fees or expenses, (B) the  indemnifying party shall have
failed to timely assume the defense  of such claim and employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such  Person, (C) the named parties to any such
action or proceeding  (including any impleaded parties) include both such
indemnified  party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party
shall  have been advised by counsel in writing that there is a conflict  of
interest on the part of counsel employed by the indemnifying  party to
represent such indemnified party, or (D) the indemnified  party\'s counsel
shall have advised the indemnified party that  there are defenses available
to the indemnified party that are  different from or in addition to those
available to the  indemnifying party and that the indemnifying party is not
able to  assert on behalf of or in the name of the indemnified party (in 
which case of either (A), (B), (C) or (D), if such indemnified  party
notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to  employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party,  (in which case of either
(C) or (D)), the indemnifying party shall  not have the right to assume the
defense of such action or  proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party but
shall have the  right to participate through its own counsel). If such
defense is  not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder,
the  indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any 
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but  such
consent will not be unreasonably withheld). If such defense  is assumed by
the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions  hereof, such indemnifying
party shall not settle or otherwise  compromise the applicable claim unless
(1) such settlement or  compromise contains a full and unconditional release
of the  indemnified party or (2) the indemnified party otherwise consents 
in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). An  indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to,  assume the defense of a
claim will not be obligated to pay the  fees and expenses of more than one
counsel for all parties  indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect
to such claim  , unless any indemnified party shall have been advised by
counsel  in writing that a conflict of interest exists between such 
indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with  respect to
such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall  be obligated to pay
the reasonable fees and disbursements of such  additional counsel or
counsels.   (d) Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the 
indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 2.6(a) or  Section 2.6(b)
are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless  an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, claims, damages,  liabilities, or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) referred  to therein, then (i) each indemnifying party
shall contribute to  the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as
a result  of such losses, claims, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in 
respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect  the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified  party in
connection with the actions which resulted in the losses,  claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses or (ii) if the allocation  provided by clause (i)
above is not permitted by applicable law,  in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect relevant equitable  considerations. The relative fault
of such indemnifying party and  indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other  things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a  material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material  fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party
or  indemnified party, and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge,  access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such  statement or
omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not  be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section  2.6(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation (even if the Holders  were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other  method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable  considerations referred to in this Section 2.6(d). The amount
paid  or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,  claims,
damages, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect  thereof) referred
to above shall be deemed to include any legal or  other fees or expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified  party in connection with
investigating or, except as provided in  Section 2.6(c), defending any such
action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.6(d), no
Holder  shall be required to contribute an amount greater than the dollar 
amount by which the proceeds received by such Holder with respect  to the
sale of any Registrable Shares exceeds the amount of  damages which such
Holder has otherwise been required to pay by  reason of such statement or
omission. No Person guilty of  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f)  of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any  Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.  The Holders\' obligations in this Section 2.6(d) to
contribute  shall be individual in proportion to the amount of Registrable 
Shares registered by them and not joint.   If sufficient indemnification is
available under this  Section 2.6, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify
each  indemnified party to the full extent provided in Section 2.6(a)  and
Section 2.6(b) without regard to the relative fault of said  indemnifying
party or indemnified party or any other equitable  consideration provided for
in this Section 2.6(d).   (e) The indemnification and contribution provided
for  under this Agreement will remain in full force and effect  regardless
of the termination of this Agreement or any  investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any  officer, director, or controlling
Person of such indemnified party  and will survive the transfer of
securities.   (f) The obligations of the parties under this Section 2.6 
shall be in addition to any liability which any party may  otherwise have to
any other party.   ARTICLE 3   MISCELLANEOUS   3.1 NOTICES. All notices
and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered

any reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and that it will take such further action as the Holders may
reasonably request to the extent required from time to time to enable the
Holders to sell Registrable Shares without registration under the Securities
Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under
the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.   3.4 GOVERNING LAW. THIS
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.   3.5 DUPLICATE ORIGINALS. All parties may

original, but all of them together shall represent the same agreement.  
3.6 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws in effect during the
term of this Agreement, such provision shall be fully severable; this
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement; and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision
or by its severance from this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms of
such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be
legal, valid, and enforceable.   3.7 NO WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS.   3.7.1 No
failure or delay on the part of Parent or any Holder in exercising any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies that may be available to Parent or any Holder at
law or in equity.   3.7.2 Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, waived or modified; provided that such amendment, waiver or
modification is in writing and is signed by Parent and a Majority in
Interest; and provided further, that any amendment, waiver, or modification
of this Agreement that (a) adversely affects a Holder\'s rights hereunder or
(b) increases a Holder\'s obligations, liabilities or duties hereunder, shall
require such Holder\'s written approval.   3.8 ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION
RIGHTS. Each Holder may assign all or any part of its rights under this
Agreement to any other Holder to whom such Holder sells, transfers or assigns
such Registrable Shares. Any such assignee of Registrable Shares shall agree
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as
each Holder is so bound. In the event that the Holder shall assign its rights
pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the transfer of less than all
its Registrable Shares to another Holder, the Holder shall also retain his
rights with respect to its remaining Registrable Shares.   SIGNATURES TO

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION     The selling stockholders may offer the common
stock from time to time:   o in one or more types of transactions (which
may include block  transactions) on the Nasdaq National Market;  o in the
over-the counter market;  o in negotiated transactions;  o through put or
call options transactions relating to the shares of  common stock;  o
through short sales of shares of common stock; or  o a combination of such
methods of sale.   Sales may be made at market prices, prevailing at the
time of sale, or at negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may sell
shares directly to purchasers or to or through broker-dealers, which may act
as agents or principals. The shares may also be sold by pledgees,
donees, transferees or other successors in interest of a selling
stockholder.   Broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of
discounts, concessions, or commissions from the selling stockholders and/or
the purchasers of shares of common stock for whom such broker-dealers may
act as agents or to whom they sell as principal, or both (which compensation
as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary
commissions).   The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers that act
in connection with the sale of shares might be deemed to be
"underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, and
any commissions received by such broker-dealers and any profit on the resale
of the shares sold by them while acting as principals might be deemed to
be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act.   The
selling stockholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-
dealer that participates in transactions involving sales of the shares of
common stock against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under
the Securities Act of 1933.   Because selling stockholders may be deemed to
be "underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act
of 1933, the selling stockholders will be subject to the prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Selling stockholders
also may resell all or a portion of the shares of common stock in open
market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933, provided they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of
such rule.      EXHIBIT B   CELL TOWERS SUBJECT TO
