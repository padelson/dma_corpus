regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or

resolve any comments of the SEC or the staff or Nasdaq, in each case, as
applicable to the Offer, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer Documents; and

 



 

(ii) if, as of any then-scheduled Offer Expiration Time, any Offer Condition

extent permitted hereunder), extend the Offer on one or more occasions in
consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer or

cause a certificate of merger, in such form as is required by the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed and
delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for
filing, all in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and (ii)
take all other necessary or appropriate action to cause the Merger to be

Parent, and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue

Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the stockholders thereof or any other Person:

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.05(b)_, _Section 2.05(c)_,
_Section 2.05(d)_ or _Section 2.07_, each Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall (i) be converted automatically into the

automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares shall have only the right to receive the Per
Share Amount with respect thereto in accordance with _Section 2.06_;

 



 

(b) each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub in
connection with the Offer) shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto;

 



 

(d) each Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into such number of fully paid, nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ") such that each direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary that owned capital stock in the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall own the same percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, without any payment of consideration therefor; and

 



 

(e) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, which, together
with any shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock held by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
_Section 2.05(d)_, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer,
Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying the Per Share Amount to each
holder of a Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with this _Section 2.06_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and

 



      
 

 



 

cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares that are converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Amount in the Merger pursuant to
_Section 2.05(a)_ (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent such fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of
any outstanding Per Share Amounts to be paid in exchange for Shares converted
in the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so
as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event no later
than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or
shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of Shares at the
Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Amount pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_, a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that delivery of the Shares
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery or transfer of the certificate representing the Shares (the "
_Certificates_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any references herein to
"Certificates" are deemed to include references to effective affidavits of
loss in accordance with _Section 2.12_ or to book-entry account statements
relating to the ownership of Shares, as applicable) to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify (after due consultation with the Company) prior to the consummation of
the Offer) for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Per Share Amount for each Share.

 



 

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Amount shall be entitled to receive the Per
Share Amount in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate promptly
upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of the Certificate ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that delivery of a book-entry statement shall not be required in
respect of any uncertificated Shares held of record in book-entry), together
with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or (ii)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
the exchange of book-entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred each
such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Per Share Amount. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such
Certificate.

 



 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the aggregate Per Share
Amounts to be paid in respect of any Certificate is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
(ii) the Person requesting such payment shall either pay to the Paying

 



      
 

 



 

Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment being
made to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) _No Other Rights_. The Per Share Amount paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of transfers
of Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall
be given a copy of a letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the
instructions therein in order to receive the Per Share Amount to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares or any Certificates
except to receive, upon surrender of a Certificate pursuant to and in
accordance with this _Section 2.06_, the Per Share Amount in respect of each
Share represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares at any time following the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Per
Share Amount in accordance with this _Section 2.06_ prior to that time shall,
subject to abandoned property, escheat or other Applicable Laws, thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to _Section 2.11_) as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Per Share Amount.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.06_ or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand appraisal and who has properly exercised and perfected a
demand for appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such
holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL with respect to such
Shares (any such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Per Share Amount but instead shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Amount in
accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall
provide Parent with prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice and/or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with

 



      
 

 



 

the prior written consent of Parent, or if required by Applicable Law, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock Units; Company
ESPP_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately
prior to the consummation of the Offer, whether vested or unvested, shall
become fully vested and shall be canceled as of immediately prior to, and
contingent upon, the consummation of the Offer (without regard to the exercise
price of such Company Stock Option) in exchange for the right to receive a
lump-sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration, if any, with
respect to such Company Stock Option.

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. Except as set forth in Item 4 of _Section
6.01(b)(xix)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Company Restricted
Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
consummation of the Offer into a vested right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the Per Share Amount for each share of Company Common Stock
underlying the Company Restricted Stock Unit.

 



 

(c) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all reasonable actions, including adopting
any necessary resolution, to (i) terminate the Companys 2017 Employee Stock

Date, (ii) ensure that no offering period under the Company ESPP shall
commence on or after the date of this Agreement, (iii) if the Closing shall
occur prior to the end of any offering period in existence under the Company

the initial Offer Expiration Time, (iv) prohibit participants in the Company
ESPP from altering their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date
of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the

and (v) provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each
participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Offer
Expiration Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP
(as amended pursuant to this _Section 2.08(c)_), be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without
interest).

 



 

(d) At or prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company, the Company
Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.08_.

 



 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the earlier of (x) five (5) days after the Effective Time and (y) the
second payroll date after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay the amounts
provided for in _Section 2.08(a) \- (b)_, net of any applicable

 



      
 

 



 

withholding taxes, payable with respect to Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Stock Units through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving
Corporations payroll to the holders of Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Stock Units. As of the consummation of the Offer, each holder of a
Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the payments provided
for under this _Section 2.08_ (except as modified by Item 4 of _Section
6.01(b)(xix)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

 



 

Section 2.09. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend, all references herein to a specified number of shares
affected thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of
shares affected thereby, including the Per Share Amount and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled (i) to deduct and withhold (or cause to be
deducted or withheld) from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person

withheld from such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax law and
(ii) to request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate
series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from any Person
to whom a payment is required to be made pursuant to this Agreement. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts
shall (i) be paid to the appropriate Taxing Authorities and (ii) to the extent
paid to the appropriate Taxing Authorities, be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

 



 

Section 2.11. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Since the Distribution

independent registered public accounting firm has identified or been made
aware of any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such

by the Company that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees of the Acquired Companies who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management or to
other individuals responsible for preparing such reports as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority, except as would not

either clause (i) or (ii) above, for any noncompliance or any reportable
transaction that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company

Transactions. The vote or consent of Parent or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub is the only vote or consent of
the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to

incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will,
at the time such document is first filed with the SEC, at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to
the holders of Shares, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are being
made, not misleading. The Offer Documents and each document required to be
filed by Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC in connection with the Offer will
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation
or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or

have access to, all funds necessary for the payment of the aggregate Per Share
Amount, as the case may be, as provided in _Article 2_ and sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement.

respect to any other information provided, or made available, to the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives or
Affiliates in connection with the Transactions, including the accuracy or

respect to or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
their businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition,
results of operations, future operating or financial results, estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects) or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any other matter furnished or
provided to Parent or Merger Sub or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or
their Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,

and not enforce, any standstill provision or similar provision that has the
effect of prohibiting the counterparty thereto from making an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Board.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
prior to the consummation of the Offer the Company receives a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.02_ in any material respect), and the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its
Representatives may, subject to compliance with this _Section 6.02_, do any
or all of the following: (i) furnish any information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and access thereto to any Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing any such

made available (including through the Data Room) to Parent promptly (and in
any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) after it is so furnished to
such Third Party or (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or discussions
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
any action that if taken by the Company would be a breach of the provisions
set forth in this _Section 6.02_, is taken by (x) a director or officer of
the Company or (y) investment bankers or financial advisors retained by the
Company, such action shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section
6.02_ by the Company.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.02_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail to make, withhold or withdraw (or
modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or
propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Board Recommendation (it being
understood that failing to recommend the rejection of any Acquisition Proposal
that is a tender offer or exchange offer, within ten (10) Business Days after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer and confirming that
the Board Recommendation remains in effect and that the Company Board has not
changed the Board Recommendation, shall be considered an adverse
modification), (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal,
(C) after public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal (other than in
connection with the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer), fail to
publicly confirm

 



      
 

 



 

(such public confirmation, a " _Recommendation Confirmation_ ") that the Board
Recommendation remains in effect and that the Company Board has not changed
the Board Recommendation (the " _Recommendation Confirmation Language_ ")
within five (5) Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so (or,
if earlier, by the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
the scheduled date of the consummation of the Offer); _provided_ , that Parent
may only make such request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and,
_provided further_ , that in each press release relating to such an
Acquisition Proposal subsequent to a Recommendation Confirmation with respect
thereto, the Company shall not fail to include the Recommendation Confirmation
Language, or (D) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys stockholders (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or enter into, any Contract, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
(ii) (A) the Company shall have provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to make a Change in Recommendation prior to
making any such Change in Recommendation, which notice shall describe the
reasons therefore and the Intervening Event in reasonable detail ( _provided_
, that such notice shall not constitute a Change in Recommendation) and (B) if
requested by Parent in good faith, during such four (4) Business Day period
after providing such notice, negotiate (and direct its Representatives to
negotiate) in good faith with Parent and its Representatives respect to any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent
proposed by Parent so that a Change in Recommendation would no longer be
necessary, and (iii) after giving effect to all revisions and proposals
contemplated by the foregoing clause (ii), if any, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
that failure to make the Change in Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event of any material change in any event, occurrence or facts relating to
such Intervening Event (other than in respect to any revisions proposed or
proposals made by Parent as referred to above), a new notice shall be required
from the Company pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)(ii)_, except that the
references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(d)_ shall be
deemed to be three (3) Business Days, and the provisions of this _Section
6.02(d)_ shall otherwise apply to the Intervening Event as modified thereby.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer if, in response to a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and
not withdrawn that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the action set
forth in clause

 



      
 

 



 

(A) or (B), as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law, then (A) subject to
compliance with _Section 6.02(f)_, the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation or (B) subject to the Companys compliance with all other
requirements for termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _6.02(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_8.01(d)(i)_ unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4)
Business Days prior written notice (the " _Superior_ ___Proposal_ ___Notice_
"), ( _provided_ , that such notice shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation), advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action
(and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and providing
Parent with a copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement (and any other
documents containing the terms of such Superior Proposal) in the form to be
entered into (provided that Parent shall be required to keep all such
documents and their terms confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement), and (y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement and
any other proposals made by Parent intended by Parent to cause such
Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any and all
adjustments to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof)
and any other agreements that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the "
_Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on
the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that the Acquisition Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be
given effect, and that the failure to make the Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations
under Applicable Law.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material revisions to the terms of a
Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the
Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice, except that the
references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(f)_ shall be
deemed to be three (3) Business Days.

 



 

(g) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) advise Parent orally or in writing in the event that the
Company receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request
for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and conditions (including
the identity of the Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal) of any

Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any financing commitments related

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a)

the stockholders of the Company that the Company has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required by Applicable
Law; _provided_ , that this _Section 6.02(h)_ shall not be deemed to permit
the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation except to the extent
permitted by _Section 6.02(d) \- (f)_ and any disclosure contemplated by
clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section 6.02(h)_ shall be deemed a Change in
Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly confirms that the Board
Recommendation remains in effect and that the Board Recommendation has not
changed in such disclosure.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Approval of Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by Section
251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, without a
stockholder vote, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice to the Company, the Acquired Companies shall, and
shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees and other

requested by Parent, during normal business hours throughout the Pre-Closing
Period, to their respective Representatives, officers, employees, properties,
facilities, books, Contracts, records (including Tax returns), reports
(including draft and final reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP relating to
the 2017 audited financials as and when furnished to the Company),

Sub through their officers, employees or other Representatives, may reasonably
request in each case, for reasonable business purposes related to

 



      
 

 



 

the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access shall be conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the
supervision of appropriate personnel of the Acquired Companies and in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the
business of the Acquired Companies. Nothing herein shall require any of the
Acquired Companies to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure
would, in the Companys reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege (so long as the Acquired Companies have
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose
such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (ii) contravene any Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
confidentiality obligation of any Acquired Company or its Affiliate (so long
as the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of
such Applicable Law, agreement or duty); _provided_ , _further_ , that
information shall be disclosed subject to the execution of a joint defense
agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel
for Parent, in each case, to the extent that the Company determines that doing
so may be reasonably required for the purposes of complying with applicable
Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 6.02_, this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed
to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parents or Merger Subs reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each party acknowledges that all information provided to it or any of its
Representatives by the other party or any of such partys Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall
be deemed to be provided under, and shall be treated in accordance with, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

party hereto shall promptly notify the other in writing of:

 



 

(a) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent, approval, permission
of or waiver from such party is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

 



 

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the

(c) the commencement or threat to commence any Stockholder/Transaction
Litigation or any other Proceeding that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
section of this Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(d) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on _Annex
A_ or in _Article 7_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall not be considered in
determining whether the conditions set forth on _Annex A_ or in _Article 7_
have been satisfied;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no notification given by any party pursuant to
this _Section 6.05_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in
this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies
contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify such partys
reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by
the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to amend or supplement
the Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such party.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, all Company Employee Plans and all employment,
severance and termination plans and agreements, in each case in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and shall
assume any Company Employee Plans that require or contemplate assumption by
their terms by an acquirer or successor. For a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each Continuing Employee (i) base salary and base wages, short-
term cash incentive compensation opportunities and severance payments and
severance benefits (in the case of severance plans and benefits, in each case,
in accordance with the severance plans and guidelines described on _Section
6.06_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, as amended pursuant to item 9 of
_Section 6.01(b)(xix)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules), in each case in
an amount no less favorable than that in effect immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement and (ii) other benefits (other than equity
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other
such benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to Continuing Employees,
Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but
not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical or other
similar benefits) and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or
other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving
Corporation, but not including any sabbatical or equity compensation plans,
programs, agreements or arrangements (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit
Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, but solely to the extent that service was credited to such
employee for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent that such credit would
not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
in

 



      
 

 



 

which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit
Plan to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan but only to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of Parents applicable insurance Contracts in effect as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will reasonably cooperate with
Parent to provide updates to the Section 280G Information, if any, following
the date hereof and to provide such other related information as reasonably
requested by Parent.

 



 

(e) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company, as
they may be amended from time to time.

 



 

(f) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.06_ are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including any Company Employee, any participant
in any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof
or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 6.06_ shall
be deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan or to
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to permit
any Person to participate in any particular benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan, before or after the consummation of the Transactions,
and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms
and Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.07. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law may become or is deemed or purports to be applicable to any
Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(ii) otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law (or, in the
case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the restrictions on business combinations
provided therein) inapplicable to or to minimize the effects of the foregoing.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.08. _Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.09. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
purchase (in consultation with Parent) a "tail" or "runoff" officers and
directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently
covered by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for the six
(6) year period following the Closing and at a price not to exceed three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Premium_
"). If the Company or Parent obtains prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with this _Section 6.09(a)_, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to purchase
such "tail" or "runoff" policy prior to Closing, then either (i) Parent may
purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy on behalf of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain an officers and directors
liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the
Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time; _provided further_ , that in satisfying its obligation
under this _Section 6.09(a)(ii)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the Current Premium and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the Current
Premium, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance that, in Parent or the Surviving Corporations good
faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to three hundred percent (300%) of the Current Premium.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification
agreement that is in effect between the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time
prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a
Company Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") and was Made Available
to Parent; and (ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation
provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time
through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of

 



      
 

 



 

expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Party than are set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her or their trustees or administrators or persons acting in
similar capacities and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by Contract or
otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) each use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable and
in any event prior to the End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities, the expiry or early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any) and the taking of all steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authorities, (ii) the delivery of required notices to, and the
obtaining of required consents or waivers from, Third Parties necessary to
consummate the Transactions and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, including the execution and delivery of
the Company Closing Representation Letter and the Parent Closing
Representation Letter (in each case, as defined in the Tri-Party Agreement).

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and file any
notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR Act
and other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as set
forth on _Section 6.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, and any
additional filings or notifications and related material that are necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions, as promptly as
reasonably practicable and advisable, (ii) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any information and
documentary material that may be requested by the DOJ or FTC under the HSR Act
or by other Governmental Authorities under applicable Antitrust Laws (if any)
and (iii) use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary or advisable to obtain prompt expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting

 



      
 

 



 

period or other approval of consummation of the Transactions by the DOJ or FTC
or other applicable Governmental Authorities. Parent shall pay all filing fees
payable pursuant to the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws (if any).

 



 

(c) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company and Parent and their respective
counsel shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private person, (ii) have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any
material filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) promptly inform
each other of any material communication (or any other material correspondence
or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC or any other
applicable Governmental Authority and (iv) promptly furnish each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between them
or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Transactions. The Company and Parent shall (with respect to any in-person
discussion or meeting), and shall to the extent practicable (with respect to
any telephonic discussion or meeting), provide the other party and its counsel
with advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any material
discussion or meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, following consultation with the
Company and after giving due consideration to its views and acting reasonably
and in good faith, and subject to Parents obligations under _Section
6.10(d)_, direct and control all aspects of the parties efforts to gain
regulatory clearance either before any Governmental Authority or in any action
brought to enjoin the Transactions pursuant to any Antitrust Laws; _provided_
, that each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
(including correspondence) submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with any governmental inquiry,
investigation or proceeding with respect to the Transactions. The Company and
Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
6.10_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.10_, materials provided to the other party or its
counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings of Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.10(a)_ and _Section 6.10(b)_, Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the parties hereto
to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the End Date, including (i) agreeing to sell, divest or otherwise
convey or hold separate any particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) permitting the Company to
sell, divest or otherwise convey

 



      
 

 



 

or hold separate any of the particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iv) terminating any joint
venture or other arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (v)
creating any relationship, contractual right or obligation of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or, in each case, entering into agreements or stipulating to
the entry of any Order by, or filing appropriate applications with, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any of the
foregoing and, in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company, by
consenting to such action by the Company (including any consents required
under this Agreement with respect to such action)) (each of the actions
described in clauses (i)(v), a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall anything in this Agreement require, or be
construed to require, the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to (1) take, or agree to take, any Divestiture Action unless all
Divestiture Actions collectively would not result in a material adverse effect
on the business, results of operations, assets or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (2) take any actions,
including the actions described in clauses (i)(v) above with respect to
Parent, its Affiliates or their respective assets, categories of assets,
businesses, relationships, contractual rights, obligations or arrangements. To
assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in this _Section
6.10(d)_, the Company shall enter into one or more agreements requested by
Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing (but conditioned
upon consummation of the Closing) with respect to any Divestiture Action.
Parent shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably
practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Transactions, and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their
respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention to, or that
would reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the expiration or termination
of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of approval of the
DOJ or FTC or under any other applicable Antitrust Laws. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require any party to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations in connection with obtaining the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any
approvals under, the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or approvals
from any other Governmental Authorities, unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

Stockholder/Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours after becoming aware of such Stockholder/Transaction
Litigation, notify Parent in writing thereof. The Company shall (x) give
Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to
be made by the Company and shall discuss in advance any material discussions
or communications proposed to be held by the Company with any Third Party in
connection with any Stockholder/Transaction Litigation (and the Company shall
in good faith take any comments or feedback provided by Parent into account),
and the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of, any
Stockholder/Transaction Litigation and (y) if Parent does not exercise such
right to participate (subject to the Companys control right), keep Parent
reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status of such
Stockholder/Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
disclosure of information in connection therewith shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 6.04_, including regarding

 



      
 

 



 

attorney-client privileges and other applicable legal privileges. No
compromise or full or partial settlement of any Stockholder/Transaction
Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

Section 6.12. _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be a
joint press release, in a form mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, and
shall be issued as promptly as practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (and in no event later than 8:30 a.m., Paris time,
on January 22, 2018). Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any other press release, or scheduling a press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to consult with each other before making any other public statement,
in each case with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such other public statement without
the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except for any such release or announcement
that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule
of any national or foreign securities exchange or association upon which the
securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall provide notice to
and, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other party about,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the party will
consider any such reasonable comments that are timely provided in good faith;
_provided_ , _however_ , each party may, without such consultation or consent,
make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements
to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents and any documents,
reports, statements, forms or other filings required to be made by Parent with
the SEC or equivalent foreign Governmental Authority, so long as such
statements, announcements and disclosures substantially reiterate (and are not
inconsistent with) previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved in
advance by the other party); and _provided further_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to consult with
the other parties hereto before issuing any press release or making any other
public statement with respect to any Change in Recommendation, Acquisition
Proposal or Intervening Event; _provided further_ that nothing in this
_Section 6.12_ shall be deemed to modify or limit, and the ability to make
any disclosures or statements pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso
shall be subject to, the Companys obligations under _Section 6.02_.

 



 

Section 6.13. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the consummation of the Offer,
the Company and the Company Board shall take all actions to the extent
necessary or as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto in connection
with this Agreement to cause the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.08_
and any and all dispositions or cancellations of equity securities of the
Company (including any deemed dispositions or cancellations and any derivative
securities with respect to any equity securities of the Company) held by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.14. _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the
consummation of the Offer, the Company and the Company Board (or duly
authorized committee thereof) shall take any action necessary to ensure that
any Compensation Arrangements entered into after the date of this Agreement

contemplated by _Section 4.03(c)_) have been approved as contemplated by
Exchange Act Rule 14d-10 for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in paragraph (d) of such Rule.

instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver. No failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. Subject to _Section 9.04(h)_, the rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Applicable Law or in equity.

_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only
if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to the proviso in _Section 8.01(b)(i)_) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)(ii)_ and (i) at any time on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, or
the intention of a Third Party to make a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal,
shall have been publicly made or otherwise become publicly known (unless
publicly withdrawn prior to such termination), and (ii) within twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination, (A) the Company enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (B) any Acquisition Transaction is
consummated, then, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee prior to
the earliest to occur of entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in
respect of or consummation of an Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 9.04(d)_, all references to

references to "50%".

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this

Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid
timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and
expenses, in each case from and including the date payment of such amount was
due to through the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 9.04_ shall be paid to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Parent shall promptly
provide the Company upon request therefor the wire transfer information
required to make any payments pursuant to this _Section 9.04_.

from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Sections 9.04(b) \- (d)_

current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, Company Stock
Option holders, Company Restricted Stock Unit holders, managers, members or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
the Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 9.05. _Assignment; Benefit_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations herein may be assigned by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any purported
assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void _ab initio_ ; _provided_

assign, in its sole discretion ( _provided_ that such assignment shall not
impede or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise
impede the rights of stockholders of the Company under this Agreement), any of
or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or
to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any
of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations
or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) from and after
the consummation of the Offer, the provisions of _Article 2_ relating to the
payment of the Per Share Amount, which shall be enforceable by the holders of
Shares immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer who validly tendered
and did not withdraw Shares pursuant to the Offer, (ii) from and after the
Effective Time, (A) the provisions of _Article 2_ relating to the payment of
the Per Share Amount and the Option Consideration, which shall be enforceable
by the holders of Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock and Company Equity Awards, as applicable, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _6.10_ which shall be
enforceable by the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom and (iii) the
provisions of _Section_ _ _ _9.04(h)_ which shall be enforceable by the
Company Related Parties. In addition, the Company shall have the right to
pursue claims for damages suffered by holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Equity Awards (including the benefit of the bargain lost by such
holders, taking into account without limitation the total amount payable to
such holders under this Agreement, which shall be deemed to be damages of the
Company, but only to the extent such claims are not pursued directly by such
holders) and other relief, including equitable relief, in connection with any
Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub. For the avoidance of
doubt, other than as expressly set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _9.05_ , no
holder of Shares shall have any third party beneficiary rights under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out
of or related hereto or the Transactions or to the inducement of any party
thereto to enter into this Agreement, (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law statute or
otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
state. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that (a) the requirements
of 6 Del. C § 2708 are satisfied by the provisions of this Agreement and that
such statute mandates the application of Delaware law to this Agreement, the
relationship of the parties, the Transactions and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereunder (b) the parties
have a reasonable basis for the application of Delaware law to this Agreement,
the relationship of the parties, the Transactions and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, (c) no other
jurisdiction has a materially greater interest in the foregoing and (d) the
application of Delaware law would not be contrary to the fundamental policy of
any other jurisdiction that, absent the parties choice of Delaware law
hereunder, would have an interest in the foregoing.

 



 

Section 9.07. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably agree (i)
that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom, or, if no such state court has proper
jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware located
in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom and (ii) not to
commence any such Proceeding in any court except such courts. Each party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in
respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, or relating to enforcement of any of the
terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each
party agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly
served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 9.01_
or in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.08.

 



 

Section 9.09. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Subject to the following sentence, it is accordingly
agreed that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in the courts described in _Section 9.07_,
without proof of damages or otherwise, and (ii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of
the parties agrees that it waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law
and will not oppose the granting of an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other parties
have an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The parties acknowledge
and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 9.09_ shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order
that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the exhibits to
this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules and any documents delivered
by the parties in connection herewith, the Tri-Party Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the

 



      
 

 



 

entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which
the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is
validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



 

Section 9.12. _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that
it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each
party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed
the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto. Any
matter set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or to
otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed
by the Company under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum
thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement, nor shall be
construed as an admission or indication to any Third Party that any breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

Section 9.13. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto, it
being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF
form, or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures.

subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Exchange
Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to such rules
and regulations, the payment for, any tendered Shares and, if permitted by the
Merger Agreement, may terminate the Offer: (i) if the Merger Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_; and (ii) at any scheduled
Offer Expiration Time (as the Offer may have been extended pursuant to, and
subject to any requirements to extend the Offer pursuant to, _Section
2.01(c)_ of the Merger Agreement), if: (A) the Minimum Tender Condition or the

(B) any of the additional conditions set forth below shall not be satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived in writing by Parent:

 



 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn that
number of Shares that (together with any Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in
Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) represent at least a majority of the Shares
outstanding at the Offer Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(b) (1) any waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR Act
applicable to the Transactions shall have expired or been terminated and (2)
all consents of, and/or filings with, any Governmental Authority or pursuant
to any Antitrust Laws set forth on _Section 6.10(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules shall have been obtained and be in full force and effect
and any applicable waiting period with respect thereto shall have expired, as
the case may be (it being understood that any consent shall be deemed obtained
if the relevant merger control authority (A) has declared that it does not
have jurisdiction, or has determined not to exercise its jurisdiction, to
review the Transactions, (B) has consented to, approved, or cleared the
Transactions or (C) may no longer prohibit the Transactions due to the expiry
of all relevant time periods);

 



 

(c) no Order shall have been issued by a Governmental Authority and no
Applicable Law shall be in effect that would (A) make the Offer or the Merger
illegal or (B) otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation thereof;

 



 

(d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall not have occurred a
