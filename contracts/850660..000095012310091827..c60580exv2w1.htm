upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, read in its entirety as
follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST: The name of the Corporation is: Thermadyne Holdings Corporation.

authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. Except as otherwise

directors of the Corporation (the &#147;<U>Board of Directors</U>&#148;) may from time to time determine.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIFTH: The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the

limitations contained elsewhere in these articles of incorporation, by-laws of the Corporation may
be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but any
by-laws adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled
to vote thereon.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEVENTH: A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability (i)&nbsp;for any breach of the director&#146;s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or knowing violation of law, (iii)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the DGCL, or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or amendment of this
Article&nbsp;SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation arising
from an act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or amendment. In addition to
the circumstances in which a director of the Corporation is not

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">personally liable as set forth in
the foregoing provisions of this Article&nbsp;SEVENTH, a director shall not be liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders to such further extent as permitted by any law hereafter enacted, including
without limitation any subsequent amendment to the DGCL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIGHTH: The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a
party to a proceeding (as hereinafter defined) by reason of the fact that he or she (i)&nbsp;is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or (ii)&nbsp;while a director or officer of the Corporation, is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer,
proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic
corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or
other enterprise, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended. Such right shall be a contract right and as such shall run to the benefit of
any director or officer who is elected and accepts the position of director or officer of the
Corporation or elects to continue to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation while this
Article&nbsp;EIGHTH is in effect. Any repeal or amendment of this Article&nbsp;EIGHTH shall be prospective
only and shall not limit the rights of any such director or officer or the obligations of the
Corporation with respect to any claim arising from or related to the services of such director or
officer in any of the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or amendment to this Article
EIGHTH. Such right shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the maximum extent permitted
under the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If a claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60&nbsp;days after a
written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole
or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim.
It shall be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or advancement of costs of
defense are not permitted under the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors or any
committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to have made its determination prior
to the commencement of such action that indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to,
the claimant is permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. In the
event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification under the foregoing provisions,
such right shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, administrators, and personal
representatives. The rights conferred above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, by-law, resolution of stockholders or
directors, agreement, or otherwise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation may additionally indemnify any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent permitted by law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used herein, the term &#147;proceeding&#148; means any threatened, pending, or completed action,
suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, any
appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to
such an action, suit, or proceeding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NINTH: The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section&nbsp;203 of the DGCL.
