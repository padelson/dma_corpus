ARTICLE 2 
 The Merger 

   

 Section 2.01. _The Merger_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in St. Louis, Missouri at the offices of Bryan Cave LLP, 211 North Broadway, Suite 3600, St. Louis, Missouri 63102, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than three Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the third Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9 for the Closing as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso), or at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree; (the "Closing Date"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as permitted by Delaware Law as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger). 

  

 (d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

  

 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary: 

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each share of Company Common Stock and each Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $15.00 in cash, without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an "Uncertificated Share") which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

  

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment._  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock and shall enter into a Paying Agent Agreement with the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Subsidiary to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit (from 

   ##### 

  

 

and after the Effective Time) of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for payment in accordance with this Section 2.03 through the Paying
Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.02. All cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.03(a) shall herewith be referred to as the "Payment Fund". Promptly
after the Effective Time (and in any event within two Business Days following
the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to
send, to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive payment
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a) a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying
Agent) for use in such payment. 

   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive only the Merger Consideration to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such holder who has not received payment of the Merger Consideration for such converted shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the 

   ##### 

  

 

foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not have, and shall not be entitled to exercise, any of the voting rights or other rights of a holder of shares of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

  

 Section 2.05. _Stock Options and Other Equity Awards._  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option under any Stock Plan, including without limitation the 2004 Stock Plan, the Director Option Plan and the Director Option Agreements, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than the earliest of: (a) three Business Days after the Effective Time, (b) the end of the year in which the Effective Time occurs, or (c) the expiration of the original term of such Company Stock Option outstanding as of the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Stock Option, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. As used herein, the term "Company Stock Option" shall mean any outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under any Stock Plan other than the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option for which the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be canceled and have no further effect, with no right to receive any consideration therefor. As of the Effective Time, all other Company Stock Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist and shall become only the right to receive the option consideration described in this Section 2.05(a), and, without limiting the foregoing, the Board of Directors or the appropriate committee 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof shall take all reasonable action to effect such cancellation, subject
to any required participant consent. 

   

 (b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the board of directors or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors will adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the ESPP: (A) participants in the ESPP may not alter their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the ESPP), (B) no new offering period will be commenced after the date of this Agreement (it being understood that any offering period in effect on the date hereof may continue in accordance with its terms), (C) the ESPP shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (D) the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately prior to the date on which the ESPP is terminated shall be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the date on which the ESPP is terminated (without interest). 

  

 (c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Restricted Share shall vest and become free of such other lapsing restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a). 

  

 Section 2.06. _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur, as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal, state, local or foreign Tax law, and if any such amounts are deducted and withheld, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as the case may be, timely pay such amounts to the appropriate Government Authority. If the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect 

   ##### 

  

 

to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2. 

   

ARTICLE 3 
 The Surviving Corporation 

   

 Section 3.01. _Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety as set forth on Annex I and, as amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.02. _Bylaws._ The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.03. _Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) except as determined by Parent or Merger Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time, the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) If requested by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any of its directors and the directors of each of its Subsidiaries (or certain of its Subsidiaries as indicated by Parent) to tender their resignations as directors, effective as of the Effective Time and to deliver to parent written evidence of such resignations at or prior to the Effective Time.

 (a) Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each employment, change of control, individual consulting, severance, vacation, or similar Contract, plan or policy and each other plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock purchase, stock option or other stock related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, tax gross-up, relocation, employee loan, vacation benefits, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and postemployment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) or other form of benefits, which is maintained, administered or contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company and covers any current or former employee, director or individual independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, contingent or otherwise (such plans are referred to collectively herein as the "Employee Plans"). Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules separately identifies each Employee Plan maintained outside of the United States substantially for the benefit of current and former directors, employees and individual independent contractors who are situated outside of the United States (each, a "Foreign Plan"). True, correct and complete copies of the Employee Plans (and, if applicable, any related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof have been furnished to Parent together with the most recent (i) summary plan descriptions, (ii) annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and the most recent actuarial report, if any, (iii) Internal Revenue Service determination letter, (iv) tax return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust, and (v) written descriptions of all non-written agreements relating to the Employee Plans, in each case, only if applicable. 

  

 (b) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due). No Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV (a "Title IV Plan") or any trust established thereunder has failed to satisfy the "minimum funding standards" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the date hereof. 

  

 (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company nor any predecessor thereof sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan or a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code). None of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates participates in any Multiemployer 

   ##### 

  

    

Plan or any pension or retirement plan sponsored by any union or similar
employee representative or sponsored by more than one unrelated employer. 

  

 (d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter that it is so qualified, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service (and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued) and, to the knowledge of the Company, the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Employee Plans which could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, claims or lawsuits which have been asserted or instituted against the Employee Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under such plans (other than routine claims for benefits), nor does the Company have knowledge of facts which could form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit. No events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code. 

  

 (e) Except as would not be materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, with respect to each Foreign Plan: (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Plan required by Applicable Law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices: (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to all current or former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. 

  

 (f) Except as otherwise specifically so contemplated in this Agreement, with respect to each current or former director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or together with any other event: (i) entitle any such person to severance pay, bonus amounts, retirement benefits, job security benefits or similar benefits, (ii) trigger or accelerate the time of payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits payable to any such person, (iii) accelerate the vesting of any compensation or benefits of any such person (including any stock options or other equity-based awards, any incentive compensation or any deferred compensation entitlement), (iv) increase the amount or value of 

   ##### 

  

    

any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to
any such person, or (v) trigger any other material obligation to any such
person. There is no Contract or plan (written or otherwise) covering any
current or former employee or individual independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code. Section 4.16(f)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all the agreements, arrangements
and other instruments which give rise to an obligation to make or set aside
amounts payable to or on behalf of the officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and/or any subsequent employment termination (whether by the Company or the
officer), true and complete copies of which have been provided to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) the maximum aggregate
amounts so payable to each such individual as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or any subsequent employment termination
(whether by the Company or the officer). 

  

 (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code. 

  

 (h) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. No condition exists that would prevent the Company or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, from amending, merging or terminating any Employee Plan without liability, other than the obligation for ordinary benefits accrued prior to the termination of such plan. 

  

 (i) Each Employee Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been maintained and operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the applicable guidance issued thereunder except for failures to comply or violations that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company. 

  

 (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to or subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement with any union or labor organization, and there has not been any activity or proceeding of any labor organization or employee group to organize any such employees. In addition, (i) there are no unfair labor practice charges or complaints against Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending before the National Labor Relations Board; (ii) there are no labor strikes, lockouts, slowdowns or stoppages actually pending or threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) there is no labor union organizing activity involving any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) there are no representation claims or petitions pending before the National Labor Relations Board and there are no questions concerning representation with respect to the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; and (v) there are no grievance or pending arbitration proceedings against the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arose out of or under any collection
bargaining agreement. 

  

 (k) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act); or (iii) such other transaction, layoff, reduction in force or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any similar state or local law.

 (a) In connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall as promptly as practicable following the date hereof (but in any event, within ten Business Days) prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall consult with Parent and Merger Subsidiary and their counsel in the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the preliminary Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review 

   ##### 

  

    

and comment thereon. The Company agrees to correct any information in the
Company Proxy Statement which to the knowledge of the Company shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall
promptly file with the SEC an amendment or supplement setting forth such
correction and mail to its shareholders, to the extent required by law, such
amendment or supplement. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable
(i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC staff with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC staff for
any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information
and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and its authorized representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC staff, on
the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement. The Company and
Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (with the
assistance of the other) to resolve any SEC staff comments with respect to
the preliminary Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive
form to be mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event, within five Business
Days) following the time the Company is informed that the SEC staff will
not review or will have no further comments with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement. 

  

 (b) Unless the Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to Section 10.01, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take all reasonable action necessary for a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the Company Proxy Statement for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, which meeting shall be held no later than forty calendar days after the mailing of the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with Parent and Merger Subsidiary and their counsel in determining the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting. Subject to Section 6.03, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and include the Company Board Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval and (iii) otherwise comply in all material respects with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, the Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting, even if the Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company shall not change the record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting or postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting; provided, however, (A) the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting (x) with the prior written consent of Parent or (y) if the Company has provided a written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary pursuant to Section 6.03 that it intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event or take action pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) with respect to a Superior Proposal and the deadline contemplated by Section 6.03 with respect to such notice has not been reached, and (B) the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting (x) for the absence of a quorum; (y) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure, which the Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under Applicable Law, and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting or (z) if required by 

   ##### 

  

    

Applicable Law; provided, further, that, in the case of (A) and (B) above,
such postponement or adjournment of the Company Shareholder Meeting shall
only be to the earliest practicable future date. Unless Parent shall have
consented to in writing in advance, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger shall be the only matter (other than procedural
matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Companys
shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting. 

  

 Section 6.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers._  

  

 (a) Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not knowingly permit its and their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other authorized agents, advisors or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing to any Third Party any non-public information) the submission or making of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party that to the knowledge or the Company is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation, recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal, (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, or other similar instrument constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or breach its obligations hereunder. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall instruct any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such information. The Company shall make its Representatives aware of the provisions of this Section 6.03. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.03 by the Company. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, the Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), (i) engage in negotiations or discussions (including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal or counter offer to) with any Third Party that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board 

   ##### 

  

    

of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, provided that, prior to
taking such action, the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (ii) thereafter furnish to such
Third Party nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in customary form
with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (A) such confidentiality agreement
shall expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of
this Section 6.03 and may not include any provision calling for an exclusive
right to negotiate with the Company, (B) the Company will not, and will not
allow its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, disclose any
commercially sensitive non-public information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to such Person, except in a manner consistent with the Companys
past practice in dealing with the disclosure of such information and (C) all
such information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to
Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided or made available to such Third Party). In addition,
notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to the adoption and
approval of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, the Board of
Directors, may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, however, that (A) if such
Adverse Recommendation Change is in response to an Acquisition Proposal, such
Adverse Recommendation Change (1) may only be made if the Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) may not be
made until the third Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis for the
proposed action by the Board of Directors and (B) if such
Adverse Recommendation Change is other than in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, such Adverse Recommendation Change (1) must be in response to an
Intervening Event, (2) may not be made (x) until the third business day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefore and (y) unless the Company, during such three Business Day
period, shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in
good faith with), and shall have caused its respective financial and legal
counsel to offer to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiate in good
faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that an Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer necessary. An
Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by Section 6.03(b) will not
constitute a breach by Company of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors from complying with requirements Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or complying with the requirements of Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03(b). For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) 

   ##### 

  

    

under the 1934 Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to the
shareholders of the Company in favor of the Merger shall not be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section
10.01(c)(i)). 

  

 (d) The Company (A) shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after (i) receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or proposal (written or oral) that would be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that to the knowledge of the Company may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) a determination by the Company to provide information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.03(b), in each case, which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making such proposal and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto), inquiry, proposal or request and shall include copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Third Party relating to such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request, and (B) thereafter shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received from or on behalf of such Third Party relating to such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request). The Company (i) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, amend, modify, render inapplicable, or grant any waiver, permission, exemption or release under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (a "Standstill Agreement"); (ii) shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent of any breach of which it is aware of any Standstill Agreement by the counterparty thereto, or any request by such counterparty to terminate, amend, modify, render inapplicable, or grant any waiver, permission, exemption or release under any such Standstill Agreement and (iii) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law each such Standstill Agreement at the request of Parent, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such Standstill Agreement and to enforce specifically the material terms and provisions thereof in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.03, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from terminating, amending, modifying, rendering inapplicable, or granting any waiver, permission, exemption or release under, any Standstill Agreement with respect to a Third Party that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, _provided_ that, prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Third Party subsequent to the date of this Agreement except as permitted or required pursuant to Section 

    ##### 

 

  

6.03(b), and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be party to
any agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary any information provided or made available to any other Person
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 6.03(b). 

  

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all relevant
factors, including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
(including price, the identity of the Person making the proposal, form
of consideration, closing conditions, any governmental and other approval
requirements, the ability to fully finance the proposal, the expected timing
and likelihood of consummation and such other aspects of the proposal as the
Board in good faith deems relevant), would result in a transaction (i) that
if consummated, is more favorable to Companys shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any binding proposal by
Parent capable of being accepted by the Company to amend the terms of this
Agreement, (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed, and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in
whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be
available by the Board of Directors. 

  

"Intervening Event" means a material event, material development or material
change in circumstances relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries which (i)
is materially favorable to the long-term financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (ii) did not
result from, arise out of, or be attributable to (A) changes,
effects, developments or events in the economy or the financial, credit or
securities markets in general (including changes in interest or exchange
rates), (B) the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (C) any changes in Applicable Law or GAAP (or
any interpretation thereof), (iii) was neither known to the Board of
Directors nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof and
(iv) becomes known to or by the Board of Directors prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that in no event shall an Intervening Event include
(x) the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or (y) any event or change relating
to Parent. 

   

 Section 6.04. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to its offices, properties, books and records, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate with Parent in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall, prior to the Effective Time, require the Company to take any action that would, based on 

   ##### 

  

    

the advice of outside legal counsel, constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or similar privilege or trade secret protection held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality obligations owing to third
parties; provided, however, that if any information is withheld by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the foregoing, the Company
shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld; and
provided, further, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) accommodate any request from Parent for access or information pursuant to
this Section 6.04 in a manner that does not result in such a waiver or
violation or (ii) obtain the required consent of such third party to provide
such access or disclosure. 

  

 (b) All information furnished pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of July 2, 2010, between IPC Manager III, L.P. and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), except for disclosure to potential investors as required in connection with the Financing subject to customary confidentiality protections. 

  

 (c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives shall modify, nullify, amend or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other parties set forth herein. 

  

 Section 6.05. _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Subsidiary such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt Financing (including the marketing efforts in connection therewith) and the repayment of any debt of the Company, including: 

   

 (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Subsidiary the Required Information; 

   

 (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies and assisting Parent in obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing; 

   

 (iii) assisting with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, tender offer documents and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing and the repayment of any debt of the Company, including execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank information memoranda; provided, that any such memoranda, prospectuses and other documents relating to the Debt Financing shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; 

   

 (iv) obtaining accountants comfort letters, appraisals, surveys, engineering reports, environmental and other inspections (including providing 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonable access to Parent and its agents to all Owned Real Property for
such purposes; provided, that such access does not include the right to
conduct any invasive soil or groundwater sampling without the Companys prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), title insurance, legal opinions and other
documentation and items relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably

Subsidiaries (not needed for other purposes), to be made available to the
Company on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger. 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, (a) irrespective of the above, no obligation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under

 (b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent and Merger Subsidiary may replace, amend or supplement the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or may amend, replace or supplement the Debt Financing Commitments in any other manner, so long as such replacement, amendment or supplement would not (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, including as a result of fees or original issue discount (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount), or (y) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (ii) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive 

   ##### 

  

    

agreements with respect thereto. For purposes of this Section 6.05, references
to "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as permitted to be replace, amended or supplemented by this
Section 6.05(b) and references to "Financing Commitments" or "Debt Financing
Commitments" shall include such documents as permitted to be replaced,
amended or supplemented by this Section 6.05(b). Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) subject to the provisions hereof and the Debt Financing
Commitments, maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitments until the date
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) satisfy
all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in
the Debt Financing Commitments (including by consummating the financing
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments subject to the
terms and conditions thereof) at or prior to Closing and otherwise comply
with its obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (iv) consummate the Financing
at or prior to the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Debt Financing Commitments, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt
Financing Commitments and (vi) cause the lenders and other Persons providing
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing contemplated to be funded
on the Closing Date by the Debt Financing Commitments (or such lesser amount
as may be required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) subject to the conditions set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any
breach or default by any party to any Financing Commitment of which they are
aware under the Debt Financing Commitments or any definitive document related
to the Financing of which Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware; (B) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Person
with respect to any (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive
document related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or (y)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive agreement with
respect thereto); and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Commitment; provided, that in no event will Parent or Merger
Subsidiary be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall have used their reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within three Business Days after the
date the Company delivers Parent or Merger Subsidiary a written request,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable as contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms
and conditions that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent
(taking into account the flex provisions set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments) than those set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment
for the financing being replaced, in an amount sufficient to consummate 

   ##### 

  

    

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the earlier of
the last Business Day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of twelve
consecutive Business Days after the date of this Agreement throughout which
(A) Parent shall have the Required Information and (B) the conditions set
forth in Section 9.01 shall have been satisfied and nothing has occurred and
no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 9.02 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be
scheduled for any time during such twelve consecutive Business Day period;
_provided, further_ , that if such period has not ended on or prior to
December 15, 2010 then it will not commence until January 3, 2011. The
Marketing Period shall not commence and shall not be deemed to have commenced
if, prior to the completion of such period, (A) the Companys independent
registered accounting firm shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with
respect to any financial statements contained in the Required Information, in
which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the
time at which a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to
the consolidated financial statements for the applicable periods by the
Companys independent registered accounting firm or another independent
registered accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent, (B) the Company
shall have publicly announced any intention to restate any of its financial
information contained in the Company SEC Documents, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the time at which
such restatement has been completed and the Company SEC Documents have been
amended or the Company has announced that it has concluded that no
restatement shall be required or (C) the Company shall have failed to file
any report with the SEC by the date required under the 1934 Act containing
any financial information that would be required, if such offering documents
were a filed registration statement, to be contained therein or
incorporated therein by reference, in which case the Marketing Period shall
not be deemed to commence until the time at which all such report have been
filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Required Information is not
Compliant throughout and on the last day of such period, then a new
twelve consecutive Business Day period shall commence upon Parent receiving
updated Required Information that is Compliant. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the
date on which the Debt Financing otherwise is obtained. Subject to the terms
of this Agreement and Applicable Law, Parent may commence its marketing of
the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments at any time after the date of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Required Information" shall mean, as of any date, (i) such
financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type required
by SEC Regulation S-X and SEC Regulation S-K under the 1933 Act (including
pro forma financial information, provided that it is understood
that assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to be made are the
responsibility of Parent) for registered offerings of debt securities of the
type contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, to the extent the same is
of the type and form customarily included, under current market practice, in
private placements under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act to consummate the
offering (provided that in no circumstance shall the Company be required to
provide subsidiary financial statements or any other information of the type
required by Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, Compensation Disclosure
and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or other information
customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum), and (ii) such
other information and data as are otherwise necessary in order to receive
customary "comfort" letters with respect to the financial statements and
data 

   ##### 

  

    

referred to in clause (i) of this definition (including "negative
assurance" comfort) from the independent auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on any date during the relevant period. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and concurrently provide
copies of all material documents provided to the lenders or otherwise related
to the Debt Financing to the Company. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9 and subject further to the provisions of Section 11.04(e) and Section 11.13. In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing to be obtained through the issuance of the Senior Notes as contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause, no later than the Closing, the senior secured credit facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments to be drawn and the proceeds of such credit facility to be used to replace such portion of the Senior Notes not issued at Closing. 

  

 Section 6.06. _FIRPTA Certificate_. Pursuant to Treasury Regulation. § 1.897-2(h) and Treasury Regulation. § 1.1445-2(c)(3), on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to Parent a statement certifying that the Company is not a U.S. real property interest because the Company is not and has not been a "United States real property holding corporation" (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,

annual premiums in the aggregate in excess of 300% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has

further_ that, if the aggregate annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

  

 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or the Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

provided that the Board of Directors shall determine prior to the Effective
Time an estimated bonus pool for 2010 and the allocation thereof based on
then available 2010 year-to-date financial statements of the Company along
with forecasts for any then remaining portion of calendar year 2010, which
amounts (and the methodology and procedures for determining such amounts)

 (f) No provision of this Section 7.05 (i) creates any third-party beneficiary or other rights, including any rights of continued employment or rights to a particular term of employment, for any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) other than Parent, the Company and their respective successors and assigns,

include, without limitation, the proffer by Parent of its willingness to
accept an order providing for the divestiture by Parent of such of its assets
and businesses as are necessary to fully consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and an offer to hold separate such assets and
businesses pending such divestiture; provided, however, that such efforts
shall not include such a proffer and/or offer by Parent if the divestiture or
holding separate of assets contemplated thereby would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. In the event that the FTC
or the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority requires the divestiture or
the holding separate by Parent of any assets, no adjustment shall be made to
the Merger Consideration and Parent shall be required to hold such assets
separate, or to divest them, as the case may be, following the Closing;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to divest or hold
separate assets if such divestiture or holding separate of assets would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Notwithstanding this Section 8.01 or any other provision herein, the
Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture or agree to any restriction on its business that would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Neither Parent nor the Company shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. 

  

 Section 8.03. _Public Announcements_.

otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company

 Section 11.13. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise breached by the Company.

 _ANNEX I_  

   

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 

  

OF 

  

THERMADYNE HOLDINGS CORPORATION 

   

 THERMADYNE HOLDINGS CORPORATION (the " _Corporation_ "), a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") does hereby certify as follows: 

  

 The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated hereby, shall, upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, read in its entirety as follows: 

  

 FIRST: The name of the Corporation is: Thermadyne Holdings Corporation. 

  

 SECOND: The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, Dover, Delaware 19904. The name of the registered agent of the Corporation at such address is National Registered Agents, Inc. 

  

 THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL, as from time to time amended. 

  

 FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. Except as otherwise provided by law, the shares of stock of the Corporation may be issued by the Corporation from time to time in such amounts, for such consideration and for such corporate purposes as the board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") may from time to time determine. 

  

 FIFTH: The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the by-laws or amendment thereof adopted by the Board of Directors. Election of directors need not be by written ballot. 

  

 SIXTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in these articles of incorporation, by-laws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but any by-laws adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon. 

  

 SEVENTH: A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or amendment of this Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation arising from an act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or amendment. In addition to the circumstances in which a director of the Corporation is not 

   ##### 

  

    

personally liable as set forth in the foregoing provisions of this Article
SEVENTH, a director shall not be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders to such further extent as permitted by any law hereafter enacted,
including without limitation any subsequent amendment to the DGCL. 

  

 EIGHTH: The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a proceeding (as hereinafter defined) by reason of the fact that he or she (i) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or (ii) while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Such right shall be a contract right and as such shall run to the benefit of any director or officer who is elected and accepts the position of director or officer of the Corporation or elects to continue to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation while this Article EIGHTH is in effect. Any repeal or amendment of this Article EIGHTH shall be prospective only and shall not limit the rights of any such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation with respect to any claim arising from or related to the services of such director or officer in any of the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or amendment to this Article EIGHTH. Such right shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the maximum extent permitted under the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or advancement of costs of defense are not permitted under the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to have made its determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the claimant is permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. In the event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification under the foregoing provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. The rights conferred above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, by-law, resolution of stockholders or directors, agreement, or otherwise. 

  

 The Corporation may additionally indemnify any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

  

 As used herein, the term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or proceeding. 

  

 NINTH: The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL.
