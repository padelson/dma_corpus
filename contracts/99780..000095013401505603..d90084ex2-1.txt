collectively referred to as the "ANTIDILUTION





                                       11
<PAGE>   18

ADJUSTMENT")), (b) an amount in cash equal to One Hundred Sixty-Five Million
Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($165,550,000) (subject to the adjustment
described below in Section 2.2.2) ((a) and (b) are collectively referred to as
the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"), and (c) the right to receive Additional Merger
Consideration Payments in accordance with Section 2.2.8. Delivery by Parent of
any Additional Merger Consideration Payment to Newco shall satisfy Parent's
delivery requirements with regard to such Additional Merger Consideration
Payment.

         2.2.2 Adjustment Amount.

                  (a) Promptly after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
         shall preliminarily determine the Working Capital Adjustment (as
         defined below), if any, in accordance with GAAP, applying Exhibit 2.2.2
         hereof. The Surviving Corporation shall set forth such preliminary
         determination on a written statement (the "WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT")
         and promptly after making such preliminary determination shall retain
         Ernst & Young LLP to perform certain agreed upon procedures as
         determined by Surviving Corporation on the Working Capital Statement.
         After completion of such engagement by Ernst & Young LLP, the Surviving
         Corporation shall deliver the Working Capital Statement to Newco within
         seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date. If within thirty (30)
         days following delivery of a copy of the Working Capital Statement,
         Newco does not give Parent written notice objecting to the calculations
         set forth on the Working Capital Statement (such notice must contain a
         statement in reasonable detail of the basis of Newco's objection), the
         Working Capital Adjustment reflected on the Working Capital Statement
         shall be conclusive and binding on the parties.

                  If Newco timely gives such notice of objection, then the
         issues in dispute shall be promptly submitted to a nationally
         recognized firm of certified public accountants selected by the mutual
         agreement of the Surviving Corporation and Newco (other than Ernst &
         Young LLP or Arthur Andersen LLP, such other firm being referred to as
         the "ACCOUNTANTS") for resolution. If Surviving Corporation and Newco
         cannot promptly agree on the selection of the Accountants, then the
         Accountants will be selected by the agreement of Ernst & Young LLP and
         Arthur Andersen LLP. If issues in dispute are submitted to the
         Accountants for resolution, (i) each party shall promptly furnish to
         the Accountants such workpapers and other documents and information
         relating to the disputed issues as the Accountants may request and are
         available to that party (or its independent public accountants), and
         shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountants any
         material relating to the determination and to discuss the determination
         with the Accountants; (ii) the determination of the Working Capital
         Adjustment by the Accountants, as set forth in a written notice ("FINAL
         WORKING CAPITAL NOTICE") delivered to both parties by the Accountants,
         shall be binding and conclusive on the parties; and (iii) the Surviving
         Corporation and Newco shall each bear 50% of the fees of the
         Accountants for such determination.

                  (b) The "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT" shall mean the difference
         between negative Two Hundred Seventy Thousand Dollars (-$270,000) and
         the Company's Working Capital, as shown on the Working Capital
         Statement, unless a dispute is submitted to the Accountants, pursuant
         to clause (a) above, in which case the "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT"
         shall be as shown on the Final Working Capital Notice.

                  (c) On or before the tenth business day following the final
         determination of the Working Capital Adjustment, (i) if Company's
         Working Capital, as shown on the Working Capital Statement or Final
         Working Capital Notice, as appropriate, is less than negative Two
         Hundred Seventy Thousand Dollars (-$270,000), then Newco shall pay to
         Parent in cash an amount equal to the Working Capital Adjustment, and
         (ii) if Company's Working Capital, as









                                       12
<PAGE>   19

         shown on the Working Capital Statement, is greater than negative Two
         Hundred Seventy Thousand Dollars (-$270,000), then Parent shall pay to
         Newco in cash an amount equal to the Working Capital Adjustment. Any
         payment made pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made by wire
         transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
         writing by Parent or Newco, as applicable, no later than the tenth
         business day after the final determination of the Working Capital
         Adjustment.

         2.2.3 Exchange Procedure. After the Effective Time, Newco shall
surrender to the Surviving Corporation for cancellation all the certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the Company Shares,
duly endorsed and executed as the Surviving Corporation may require. When the
certificates shall have been so delivered, the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to
the account designated in writing by Newco at least two (2) business days before
the Closing) and the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration
shall be issued to Newco registered in the name of Newco (in denominations of
not less than fifty thousand (50,000) shares each as designated in writing by
Newco at least five (5) business days before the Closing). At the Effective
Time, Newco, as the holder of certificates evidencing the Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such stock, and its sole right shall be to receive the
Merger Consideration and, subject to certain conditions, Additional Merger
Consideration Payments.

         2.2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. As of the
Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and the holder
of a certificate representing any Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and,
subject to certain conditions, Additional Merger Consideration Payments, without
interest. All rights to receive the Merger Consideration and, subject to certain
conditions, Additional Merger Consideration Payments, shall be deemed, when paid
or issued hereunder, to have been paid or issued, as the case may be, in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on Company's stock
transfer books of Company Shares. If after the Effective Time, a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding
Company Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, it
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in Section 2.2.3.

         2.2.5 Merger Sub Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         2.2.6 Treasury Stock. Any shares of Company held in the treasury of
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and returned
and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

         2.2.7 Escrow Agreement; Stock Powers. At the Closing, Newco and Parent
shall execute and deliver to each other the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which
Newco shall contemporaneously therewith deliver to the Escrow Agent, if the
Closing Date is on or prior to December 31, 2001, an aggregate of Six Million
Five Hundred Thousand (6,500,000) shares of Parent Common Stock (subject to
Antidilution Adjustment), or, if the Closing Date is after December 31, 2001, an
aggregate of Four Million Six Hundred Forty-Two Thousand One Hundred
Seventy-Five (4,642,175) shares of Parent Common Stock (subject to Antidilution
Adjustment) (the "ESCROWED SHARES"). The Escrowed Shares shall be held under the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. At the Closing, Newco shall
deliver twenty (20) stock powers to the Escrow Agent executed in blank with the
signatures guaranteed







                                       13

by a national bank if reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent. If after Closing
additional stock powers are reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent or Parent,
Newco shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent such stock powers.

         2.2.8 Payment of Additional Merger Consideration.

                  (a) If on any Calculation Date, as determined in accordance
         with clause (b) below, the aggregate amount of the Current Credit
         Amounts, if any, for all Calendar Years ending prior to such
         Calculation Date exceeds the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of all
         Additional Merger Consideration Payments, if any, made prior to such
         Calculation Date and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Current Deficit
         Amounts, if any, for all Calendar Years ending prior to such
         Calculation Date, Parent shall pay to Newco a cash amount (an
         "ADDITIONAL MERGER CONSIDERATION PAYMENT") equal to such excess amount.
         The payment of each Additional Merger Consideration Payment shall be by
         wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated

         determination and calculation set forth on the Calculation Notice (as

         fifteen (15) days following the Calculation Date (as defined below)
         relating to such Additional Merger Consideration Payment or (y) if
         Newco timely gives notice of objection regarding the determination and
         calculation set forth on the Calculation Notice (such notice must

         objection) to the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) days following
         the Calculation Date, within five (5) days following the earlier of the
         mutual agreement of Newco and the Surviving Corporation as to such
         Additional Merger Consideration Payment or the receipt by the Surviving
         Corporation of the Final Calculation Notice relating to such Additional
         Merger Consideration Payment.

                  (b) On a date (a "CALCULATION DATE") within forty-five (45)
         days after the end of each Calendar Year, the Surviving Corporation
         shall (i) determine the Market Deliveries for such Calendar Year; (ii)
         determine (X) the amount (the "CURRENT CREDIT") by which the Market
         Deliveries for such Calendar Year exceeds the Baseline Market
         Deliveries for such Calendar Year and the related Current Credit Amount
         for such Calendar Year or (Y) the amount (the "CURRENT DEFICIT") by
         which the Baseline Market Deliveries for such Calendar Year exceeds the
         Market Deliveries for such Calendar Year and the related Current
         Deficit Amount for such Calendar Year, as the case may be; (iii)
         calculate whether an Additional Merger Consideration Payment is payable
         pursuant to clause (a) above as a result of such determinations for
         such Calculation Date; and (iv) give written notice (a "CALCULATION
         NOTICE") to Newco setting forth its determinations and calculations.

                  If Newco timely gives notice of objection regarding the
         determination and calculation set forth on the Calculation Notice, then
         Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall attempt in good faith to
         resolve the objection, and if they are unable to do so within ten (10)
         days of delivery by Newco to the Surviving Corporation of Newco's
         objection, then the issues in dispute shall then be promptly submitted
         to the Executive Director of the American Association of Railroads or
         his or her designee for resolution. If the issues in dispute are
         submitted to the Executive Director of the American Association of
         Railroads or his or her designee for resolution, (i) each party shall
         promptly furnish such Person such documents and information relating to

         determination with such Person; (ii) the determination by such Person
         of the issues in dispute, as set forth in a written notice (the "FINAL
         CALCULATION NOTICE") delivered to both parties by such Person, shall





                                       14

                  contains a true and complete list of each Foreign Employee
                  Benefit Plan other than a Foreign Governmental Employee
                  Benefit Plan.

                  Foreign Collectively Bargained Employee Benefit Plan or a
                  Foreign Governmental Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained
                  in compliance in all material respects with its terms and with

                  required, in good standing with applicable regulatory
                  authorities. All contributions, premiums or other payments

                           (iii) The present value of the accrued benefit
                  liabilities (whether or not vested) attributable to employees
                  of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for which Company or
                  any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable under each Foreign
                  Employee Benefit Plan that is a pension or retirement plan
                  (including, without limitation, any superannuation fund) or
                  that provides for actuarially-determined benefits, determined
                  as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year of
                  Company or any such Subsidiary, on the basis of actuarial
                  assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not exceed the
                  current value of the assets of such Foreign Employee Benefit
                  Plan allocated to such benefit liabilities, or, alternatively,
                  Company or any such Subsidiary has established adequate
                  reserves for the present value of such accrued benefit
                  liabilities, determined as described herein, in the Balance
                  Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet.

                           (iv) No action, litigation, audit examination,
                  investigation or administrative proceeding has been made,

                  Employee Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
                  result in a material liability of Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries. No Foreign Employee Benefit Plan that is not a
                  Foreign Governmental Employee Benefit Plan provides for
                  post-employment or retiree health, life insurance and/or other
                  welfare benefits and has unfunded liabilities, and neither
                  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
                  provide any such benefits to any active employees following
                  such employees' retirement or termination of service, to any
                  retired or former employees, or to any beneficiary of any
                  retired or former employee following such employees' death.

                           (v) There are no material liabilities of Company or
                  any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Foreign Employee
                  Benefit Plan that are not accrued or otherwise disclosed in
                  the Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet. With respect
                  to each Foreign Employee Benefit Plan (other than a Foreign
                  Governmental Employee Benefit Plan), to the Knowledge of
                  Company, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
                  received any written notice of a material increase in the
                  benefits relating to any such Foreign Employee Benefit Plan
                  from the level of benefits for the most recent fiscal year
                  ended thereof. To the Knowledge of Company, neither Company
                  nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of
                  a material increase in the benefits relating to any Foreign
                  Collectively Bargained Employee Benefit Plan from the level of
                  benefits for the most recent fiscal year ended thereof.

                           (vi) The execution of this Agreement and the
                  consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not
                  constitute a triggering event under any Foreign Employee
                  Benefit Plan, whether or not legally enforceable, which
                  (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
                  subsequent event) will or may result in any payment,
                  acceleration, vesting or increase in benefits to any employee
                  or former employee or director of Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Part 3.13(q) of Newco's
                  Disclosure Letter, no Foreign Employee Benefit Plan (other
                  than a Foreign Governmental Employee Benefit Plan) provides
                  for the payment of severance, termination, change of control
                  or similar-type payments or benefits. Company has delivered or
                  made available to the Parent or its counsel true and complete
                  copies of each Foreign Employee Benefit Plan, other than a

                  all amendments thereto, and, if applicable, all current trust
                  agreements and other documents establishing other funding

         Company and its Subsidiaries is terminable without any severance
         obligation of any kind on the part of the employer, and the

         as such) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All material sums due
         for employee compensation and benefits and all material vacation and

                  (a) The election of each of Company and Thrall Company to be
         taxed as a QSSS under Section 1361 of the IRC will terminate on the
         Closing Date. As a result, for federal and state income and franchise
         tax purposes, the Merger will be treated as a deemed taxable sale by
         Newco of all the assets of Company and Thrall Company acquired by
         Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date (the "ACQUIRED ASSETS") and
         the deemed assumption of the liabilities of Company and Thrall Company
         assumed by the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date.

                  (b) Parent and Newco agree that for federal and state income
         and franchise tax purposes the consideration to be received by Newco in
         the deemed sale of the Acquired Assets (plus the amount of liabilities
         deemed to be assumed and other relevant items) shall be allocated among
         the Acquired Assets in accordance with the methodology set forth on a
         schedule substantially in the form of Exhibit 6.7(b) attached hereto
         (the "ALLOCATION SCHEDULE"). The Allocation Schedule shall be agreed to
         by the parties not later than 60 days after the Closing Date. The
         Allocation Schedule shall comply with the requirements of Section 1060
         of the IRC. Each of the parties shall report the Merger for all federal
         and state income and franchise tax purposes, including without
         limitation in all Tax Returns prepared and filed by or for such party
         and with respect to any Section 338 Elections, in accordance with the
         allocations set forth in Exhibit 6.7(b). Newco and Parent shall each
         prepare and file an IRS Form 8594 for the deemed sale of the Acquired
         Assets and assumption of liabilities with their respective federal
         income Tax Returns for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.
         Each of the parties shall provide prompt notice to the other of the
         commencement of any audit or the assertion of any proposed deficiency
         or adjustment by any taxing authority or agency that challenges the
         allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule.

                  (c) Although both parties believe that the Merger should be
         treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable sale of
         Acquired Assets to Parent under Treasury Regulation Section
         1.1361-5(b)(3), in order to assure the tax treatment of the Merger as a
         deemed purchase of assets, Parent and Newco shall make a protective
         election under Section 338(h)(10) of the IRC with respect to the
         acquisition of Company, which for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
         shall be made on a Form 8023 (or successor form), substantially in the
         form of Exhibit 6.7(c) hereto







                                       53

         (including the footnotes/statements thereon). Parent and Newco also
         shall make a similar election for state income/franchise tax purposes
         (using a state election form) as may be required under Applicable Law.

                  (d) Parent and Newco agree that any adjustments to the total
         amount of consideration to be received by Newco (whether by reason of
         the Working Capital Adjustment in Section 2.2.2, the receipt of
         Additional Merger Consideration Payments pursuant to Section 2.2.8, or
         indemnity clams made pursuant to Article 9) will be treated as
         adjustments to the amount of consideration to be allocated among the
         Acquired Assets in accordance with the methodology set forth on the
         Allocation Schedule and in accordance with the requirements of Section
         1060 of the IRC. Parent and Newco also agree that the Additional Merger
         Consideration Payments shall be allocated to the Class VII assets
         (goodwill and going concern value) as defined in Treas. Reg.
         1.338-6(b)(2)(vii).

6.8 Transfer Taxes. Newco and Parent shall each pay 50% of any state, local,
foreign or provincial sales, use, real property transfer, stock transfer, stock
or similar tax (including any interest or penalties with respect thereto)
payable in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

6.9 Standstill Time.

                  (a) During the Standstill Time, except upon the prior written
         approval of Parent, neither Newco nor Company will, directly or

                  written consent), become a "participant" in any "election
                  contest" (as such terms are defined or used in Regulation 14A

                  Parent as described in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or
                  knowingly induce any Person to initiate any stockholder
                  proposal relating to Parent;

                           (iii) form, join or in any way participate in a
                  "group," (within the meaning of Section 13d-3 of the Exchange
                  Act), act in concert with any other Person or otherwise take
                  any action or actions that would cause it to be deemed a
                  "person" (for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),

                  foregoing, with or among each other, or with their outside

                  discussions neither of them is required to make, and neither
                  of them makes, any public announcement or filing under the

                           (x) disclose or publicly announce any intention, plan
                  or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing.


If Newco or Company receives any proposal (oral (that is credible) or written),
offer or inquiry regarding any of the matters described in this Section 6.9, it
shall promptly notify Parent in writing of the nature and content of such
matter, including the names of the Persons involved with such matter.

                  (b) During the Standstill Time, Newco and Company shall be
         present, in person or by proxy, and without further action hereby agree
         that they shall be deemed to be present, at all properly called

         Parent's stockholders at which Parent Common Stock owned beneficially
         by Newco or Company are entitled to vote, Newco and Company shall vote

         the date of this Agreement, preferred stock with an aggregate purchase
         price of more than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) or the issuance
         of any equity securities with voting rights that are greater in any
         respect than those of the Parent Common Stock, (x) any disposition of
         Parent (by way of merger, sale of assets or otherwise) of a substantial
         part of its assets, (y) any recapitalization of Parent (other than a

         effect a change in Parent's state of incorporation), including, without
         limitation, any leveraged buyout of Parent or similar going-private
         transaction, or (z) any liquidation of, or consolidation involving,
         Parent

                  (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8,
         then the provisions of Section 6.9(b) shall also terminate.

at all times maintain a minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of Twenty Five

the end of (a) the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurs and (b)
each subsequent fiscal quarter during the Financial Covenant Period, Newco shall

such balance sheet shall be accompanied by a certificate from Newco's Chief
Financial Officer certifying that such balance sheet conforms with the
requirements of this Section 6.10 and certifying as to Newco's Consolidated
Tangible Net Worth and that Newco's Total Debt does not exceed Newco's
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth as of the date of such balance sheet.

foregoing, Company shall not be required to continue the employment of any
particular Employee after Closing, and the employment of any such Employee may
be terminated at any time after the Closing in accordance with the applicable
law. Parent shall take all actions necessary so that Employees will receive

after Closing in which such Employees are eligible to participate.

         6.12.2 Newco shall be responsible for (a) all claims for welfare
benefits (other than medical and dental benefits) which are incurred prior to
the Closing by any Employee (or the eligible dependent of any Employee) that are
payable under the terms and conditions of the Group Benefits Plan and (b) all
claims for welfare benefits, including medical and dental benefits, that are

and to the extent such claims do not exceed the reserves for the payment of such
claims shown on the books of Company as of the Closing plus $50,000; and (y) for
the welfare benefit claims, including medical and dental claims, that are

Employee), (ii) each employee of the Company on leave of absence, with recall
rights, on workers' compensation or on disability as of the Closing, except that
Newco shall be responsible for continuing long-term disability benefits in pay
status as of the Closing under the Group Benefits Plan for the period specified
thereunder, and (iii) each former employee of Company, who, as of the Closing,
is eligible for or receiving COBRA continuation coverage under the welfare
benefit plans established by Parent or Surviving Corporation. For purposes of
this Section 6.12.2, a claim for welfare benefits shall be deemed to be
incurred: in the case of medical, health or dental benefits, when the medical,
health or dental service or supply is provided, and in the case of disability,
life insurance and any other welfare benefits, when the event directly giving
rise to the claim occurs. The Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable,
shall recognize under applicable welfare plans, policies and arrangements of
Parent such copayments and deductibles paid by such Employee or dependent under
the Plans prior to the Closing and shall not exclude any preexisting conditions
of any such Employee or dependent that were not excluded under the Plans
immediately prior to the Closing.

remedies, including, without limitation, any right to employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this
Agreement.

         6.12.4 Company shall cooperate with Newco in providing reasonable
access to each Employee's personnel and related file from and after Closing and

copies thereof, available to Newco in connection with a legal or regulatory
claim, action or sanction relating thereto, provided that Newco provides
reasonable advance notice of its intent to review such files.

necessary and legally permissible actions to cause the transfer of the assets of
each Qualified Plan set forth in Part 6.12.5 of Newco's Disclosure Letter from

R. Wallace and John L. Adams shall ask the other members of the Parent Knowledge
Group if any of such Persons are aware of a breach of a representation or
warranty or a covenant or obligation of Newco, Company or any of Company's
Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement. If prior to the Closing Date, Timothy
R. Wallace or John L. Adams have concluded that a breach of a representation or
warranty or a covenant or obligation of Newco, Company or any of Company's
Subsidiaries has occurred which would result in an indemnification claim against
Newco, Company or any of Company's Subsidiaries in excess of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) pursuant to Section 9.2.1 or 9.2.2, Parent shall notify Newco and
Company of such conclusion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure (a) by
Timothy R. Wallace or John L. Adams to ask the other members of the Parent
Knowledge Group if any of them were aware of a breach of a representation or
warranty or a covenant or obligation of Newco, Company or any of Company's
Subsidiaries or (b) by Parent to make such notification to Newco or Company
shall not nullify or otherwise waive Parent's right to indemnification with
respect to such breach or assert any other rights under this Agreement and shall
not constitute a defense by Newco or Company to such claim for indemnification.

6.14 Payment of Cash Balances. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date but
not later than the tenth business day after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay Newco an amount in cash equal to the amount of cash in

and the Closing Date and whose election to the Board of Directors of Parent or
whose nomination for election to the Board of Directors of Parent by the
stockholders of Parent were approved by a majority of the directors of Parent
then in office who are referred to in clause (a) or this clause (b), cease for
any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of Parent;

         8.1.4 by Newco, if in a transaction or series of transactions that was
not approved by the Board of Directors of Parent, any Person (collectively with
such Person's Affiliates) acquires 35% or more of the issued and outstanding
Parent Common Stock;

         8.1.5 by Newco, if as a result of closing a tender offer or exchange

and outstanding Parent Common Stock;

         8.1.6 by Newco, upon written notice to Parent provided within three (3)
business days after Newco receives notice from Parent (which notice Parent shall

terminate the Agreement, or of Newco or Company, if Newco is seeking to
terminate this Agreement, to comply fully with its obligations under this
Agreement) on or before July 15, 2002.

8.2 Effect of Termination. Except for terminations described in Section 8.3,
each party's right of termination under Section 8.1 is in addition to any other
rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise and the exercise of a right
of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, all further obligations of the parties under
this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations in Article 9 and
Sections 6.2, 6.9(a), 8.3, 10.1 and 10.2 will survive; provided, however, that
if this Agreement is terminated by a party because of the Breach of the
Agreement by the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the
terminating party's obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a
result of the other party's failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement, the terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired.

8.3 Termination Fee. If this Agreement is validly terminated by Newco pursuant
to Sections 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.1.5, 8.1.7 or 8.1.8 or because the waiting period
under the HSR Act has not expired or been terminated and such waiting period
would have expired or been terminated prior to July 15, 2002, but for









                                       66
<PAGE>   73

the occurrence between the date hereof and July 15, 2002 of (a) a merger or
other combination of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with another Person, (b)
an acquisition or disposition of stock or assets by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (c) any other similar transaction or occurrence, then Parent
shall pay to Newco a termination fee in the amount of Thirteen Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,500,000). This termination fee shall be the
exclusive remedy for Newco and Company if this Agreement is terminated for any
of the reasons set forth in this Section 8.3, and Newco and Company hereby
waive, release and discharge forever Parent and Merger Sub for all liabilities
(including, but not limited to, incidental and consequential damages), whether
known or unknown that either Newco or Company may have under applicable law.

8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any the obligations or acts of the
other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute
a waiver of those rights.


                                    ARTICLE 9
                            INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

9.1 Survival; Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge. All
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement,
Newco's Disclosure Letter, Parent's Disclosure Letter and any other certificate
or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing. The
right to indemnification based on such representations, warranties, covenants
and obligations will not be affected by any investigation conducted by any party
with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired by any party (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.
The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation
will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of damages or other remedy
based on such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

9.2 General Indemnification by Newco. Newco shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent, the Surviving Corporation (from and after the Closing) and their
respective Representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages
(excluding incidental and consequential damages, other than incidental and
consequential damages for which Parent is liable to third parties), expenses
(including reasonable costs of investigation and defense and reasonable
attorneys' fees), whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively,
"DAMAGES"), that any Indemnified Person may incur or become subject to arising,
directly or indirectly, out of or in connection with:

         9.2.1 any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Newco in
this Agreement, Newco's Disclosure Letter or any other certificate or document
delivered by Newco or Company pursuant to this Agreement (provided that each
representation or warranty of Newco contained herein or therein that is subject
to a materiality, Material Adverse Effect, Material Adverse Change or similar
qualification shall be deemed to be not so qualified in determining the
existence of any Breach thereof on the part of Newco for the purpose of Article
9);




                                       67
<PAGE>   74

         9.2.2 any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Newco in
this Agreement or Newco's Disclosure Letter as if such representation or
warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent any such
representation or warranty speaks as of an earlier date (provided that each
representation or warranty of Newco contained herein or therein that is subject
to a materiality, Material Adverse Effect, Material Adverse Change or similar
qualification shall be deemed to be not so qualified in determining the
existence of any Breach thereof on the part of Newco for the purposes of Article
9);

         9.2.3 any Breach by Newco or Company of any covenant or obligation of
Newco or Company in this Agreement;

         9.2.4 any product warranty claims relating to the products manufactured
by Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing that are in excess of
product warranty reserves reflected for such purpose on the Working Capital
Statement;

         9.2.5 any liabilities for federal and state income and franchise Taxes
relating to Newco, Company or any of Company's Subsidiaries, if any, that
accrued or relate to the period prior to the Closing that are in excess of the
amounts accrued and reflected for such purpose on the Working Capital Statement;
or

         9.2.6 any event, condition, circumstance, activity, practice, incident,
action, omission or plan (whether or not such event, condition, circumstance,
activity, practice, incident, action, omission or plan constitutes a Breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement) relating in
any way (a) to any of the actions, assets, or the use of such assets prior to
the Closing Date, or liabilities referred to in Section 5.10, including any
increase in Tax liability due to any of such actions, assets, use of such
assets, or liabilities or (b) to the real property formerly owned by Company,
any of its predecessor entities, any of Company's Subsidiaries, any predecessor
to any of Company's Subsidiaries, any of Company's former Subsidiaries or any
predecessor to any such former Subsidiary; provided however, that with respect
to such real property described in this clause (b), Newco's indemnity shall
apply to only those Damages (including without limitation reasonable costs of
investigation, remediation, containment or other management of any Hazardous
Substance and fees and expenses of any consultants or contractors), including
Damages based on negligence prior to Closing of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, strict liability or CERCLA or analogous state laws, that any of
the Indemnified Persons may incur or become subject to under any Environmental
Laws arising out of or in any way relating to the condition of or operations on
such real property.

9.3 Indemnification by Newco for Environmental Matters. Newco shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Damages
(including without limitation reasonable costs of investigation, remediation,
containment or other management of any Hazardous Substance and fees and expenses
of any consultants or contractors), including Damages based on negligence prior
to Closing of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, strict liability or CERCLA or
analogous state laws, that any of the Indemnified Persons may incur or become
subject to under any Environmental Laws arising out of or in any way relating to
the condition or operation of the Facilities or the operation of the business by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to Closing, provided, however, the
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to any indemnification for any Damages
identified as a result of the conduct of any post-Closing ASTM Phase 2 soil
and/or groundwater environmental assessment, unless such assessment is (a)
undertaken to meet an Indemnified Person's legal duties under Environmental Law,
including the mitigation of potential liability under Environmental Law;
provided, that with respect to mitigation, Parent must have received an opinion
of outside legal counsel that the duty to mitigate is based on clear and
convincing evidence not based on information included in Newco's Disclosure
Letter; further, provided, that Parent shall have notified Newco in advance of
its intention to









                                       68
<PAGE>   75

seek such legal opinion, (b) necessary for the construction or modification of
any structure, equipment or utilities, including any necessary preconstruction
investigative or site work or (c) based upon credible evidence disclosed by an
employee or former employee of Surviving Corporation, Company or any Subsidiary
of Surviving Corporation or Company related to the Environment at a Facility
prior to Closing and that was not disclosed in Newco's Disclosure Letter.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Newco shall have
no indemnification obligation (i) for Breaches of Section 3.20 pursuant to
Section 9.2 or (ii) pursuant to this Section 9.3, in either case, for Damages
relating to or involving capital expenditures or operation changes to the
Facilities resulting from alleged violations of Environmental Law prior to the
Closing Date, other than capital expenditures or operation changes as required
to directly remediate the condition giving rise to the underlying
indemnification obligation and make any necessary repairs related to such
remediation.

         Parent shall be entitled to control and make any and all decisions
regarding any remediation, any related Proceeding and, except as provided in the
last sentence of this paragraph, any other Proceeding with respect to which
indemnity may be sought under this Section 9.3, provided, however, Parent shall
provide Newco with reasonable notice and opportunity to review, comment and
actively participate in any such remediation or related Proceeding, and any
comment, review and participation by Newco shall not constitute a waiver of
Newco's right to assert that Parent is not entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 9.3 or any other Section hereof. The Indemnified Persons' right
to indemnification under this Section 9.3 shall not extend to costs of
investigation, remediation, containment or other management of any Hazardous
Substance in excess of those reasonably necessary to achieve compliance with the
least stringent applicable standards then in effect under Environmental Law that
would not result in the imposition of any significant restriction on the
operations of the business of Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
as a railcar manufacturing company or any of the Facilities as a railcar
manufacturing facility. The procedure described in Section 9.9 will apply to any
claim solely for monetary damages relating to a matter covered by this Section
9.3.

9.4 Procedure for Indemnification --Tax Claims.

                  (a) If Parent receives notice of the assertion of any claim,
         the commencement of any Proceeding, or the imposition of any penalty or
         assessment by a Governmental Body against Newco, Company or Company's
         Subsidiaries for a Taxable period or periods ending on or before the
         Closing Date (a "TAX CLAIM"), and if Parent intends to seek indemnity
         from Newco therefor, then Parent shall provide Newco with prompt
         written notice of the Tax Claim, but in any event no later than thirty
         (30) calendar days after receipt of notice of the Tax Claim. The
         failure by Parent to notify Newco of a Tax Claim shall not relieve
         Newco of any indemnification responsibility, unless such failure
         materially prejudices the ability of Newco to defend such Tax Claim.
         Newco shall have the sole right to control the defense or settlement of
         such Tax Claim with counsel of its choosing at Newco's sole expense;
         provided, however, that Parent shall be permitted, at Parent's sole
         expense, to be present at any audit or Proceeding in respect of such
         Tax Claim; provided, further, that Newco shall not settle or compromise
         any Tax Claim without Parent's prior written consent, which consent
         shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.

                  (b) Parent shall have the sole right to represent the
         interests of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in the
         defense of any claim for Taxes relating to Taxable periods ending after
         the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense.

9.5 Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless Newco from and against any and all Damages that Newco may incur or
become subject to arising, directly or indirectly, out of or in connection with:









                                       69
<PAGE>   76

         9.5.1 any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or
Merger Sub in this Agreement, Parent's Disclosure Letter or in any other
certificate or document delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement (provided that each representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
contained herein or therein that is subject to materiality, Material Advance
Effect, Material Adverse Change or similar qualification shall be deemed to be
not so qualified in determining the existence of any Breach thereof on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub for the purposes of this Article 9);

         9.5.2 any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or
Merger Sub in this Agreement or Parent's Disclosure Letter as if such
representation and warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date, except to
the extent any such representation or warranty speaks as of an earlier date
(provided that each representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained
herein or therein that is subject to a materiality, Material Adverse Effect,
Material Adverse Change or similar qualification shall be deemed to be not so
qualified in determining the existence of any Breach thereof on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub for the purposes of Article 9);

         9.5.3 any Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or obligation
of Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement; or

         9.5.4 any product warranty claims relating to the products manufactured

9.7 Limitations on Indemnification Amount -- Newco

         9.8.2 Except as set forth in Section 9.8.3, Parent shall be only

9.9 Procedure for Indemnification -- Third Party Claims.

         9.9.1 Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 9.2,
9.3 or 9.5 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such
indemnified party shall, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party
under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of
such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified
party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the
defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party's failure to give
such notice.

         9.9.2 If any Proceeding referred to in Section 9.9.1 is brought against
an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (a)
indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (b)
the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified
party of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide
indemnification with respect to such Proceeding, in which case the identified
party may retain its own counsel and be reimbursed for its expenses incurred in
connection therewith pursuant to this Article 9), to assume the defense of such
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and,
after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party shall
not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
indemnified party under this Article 9 for any fees of other counsel or any
other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of
such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation and except as
provided above. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding,
(x) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the
claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification; (y) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected
by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party's consent unless (A)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements by an
indemnified party or any violation of the rights of any Person by an indemnified
party and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified
party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full
by the indemnifying party or other determination binding solely on the
indemnifying party; and (z) the indemnified party shall have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its
consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement of any
Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within thirty (30) days after
the indemnified party's







                                       72
<PAGE>   79

notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume
the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party shall be bound by any
determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected
by the indemnified party.

         9.9.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages
for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive
right to defend, compromise or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying
party shall not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any
compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld).

9.10 Procedure for Indemnification -- Other Claims. A claim for indemnification
for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted by written
notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

9.11 Insurance And Tax Benefit; Reserve. The amount of Damages subject to
indemnification under this Article 9 shall be reduced by (a) the amount, if any,
that the indemnified party receives under any insurance policy with respect to
such Damages and the indemnified party shall, in good faith, pursue claims for
insurance proceeds to which it is entitled; (b) the amount, if any, of the
present value of any net tax benefit that the indemnified party may receive or
otherwise enjoy with respect to the matter that gave rise to the Damages; and
(c) the amount, if any, of any specific designated reserve or accrued
liabilities provided for in Company's financial statements in respect of the
subject matter of the claim for indemnification. If the amount by which the
reserve shown on the Working Capital Statement for payment of medical and dental
claims exceeds the amount paid by Surviving Corporation under Section 6.12.2 to
Newco to reimburse Newco for such claims, the excess amount shall be transferred
and added to the amount of the reserve shown on the Working Capital Statement
for payment of workers' compensation claims.

9.12 Subrogation. To the extent that any indemnified party has the right to
recover the amount of (or part of the amount of) any claims such indemnified
party may seek to assert against an indemnifying party pursuant to Article 9 by
way of a claim against any third party on the basis of the same or substantially
similar facts or circumstances as gave rise to the claim against the
indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall cause the indemnifying party to
be subrogated to the indemnified party in respect of its claim against any such
third party. In such case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to conduct in
the name of the indemnified party any claim, action, suit or other proceeding
against that third party and the indemnified party shall make available or cause
its Representatives and Affiliates to make available to the indemnifying party
such persons and all such information or materials as the indemnifying party may
reasonably require for pursuing the claim against such third party, subject to
reimbursement for out of pocket expenses related thereto and without
unreasonable disruption of the business or operations of the indemnified party.

9.13 Exclusive Remedy -- Indemnified Persons. In the absence of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, an Indemnified Person's rights under this Article
9 shall be such person's sole and exclusive remedy for Damages arising from any
matter described in Sections 9.2 and 9.3. Except as provided in the previous
sentence, the Indemnified Persons hereby waive, release and discharge forever
Newco from all liabilities, whether known or unknown, and any right of
contribution and/or indemnity such Indemnified Persons may have under applicable
law, including, but not limited to, Environmental Laws. The provisions of this
Section 9.13 shall be absolute and continuing and shall survive the termination
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this Section 9.13, if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or Merger Sub because of a Breach of the Agreement by Newco
or Company or because one or

misrepresentation, Newco's and Company's (prior to Closing with respect to
Company's) rights under this Article 9 shall be their sole and exclusive remedy
for Damages arising from any matter described in Section 9.5. Except as provided
in the previous sentence, Newco and Company (prior to Closing with respect to
Company) hereby waive, release and discharge forever Parent and Merger Sub from
all liabilities, whether known or unknown and any right of contribution and/or
indemnity Newco or Company (prior to Closing with respect to Company) may have
under applicable law, including, but not limited to, Environmental Laws. The
provisions of this Section 9.14 shall be absolute and continuing and shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this Section 9.14, if
this Agreement is terminated by Newco or Company because of a Breach of the
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or because one or more conditions to Newco's

                           securities and other investments on the Company's
                           books on the Closing Date (which cash, cash

                  (xi)     reserves for, and refunds of, income taxes.

3.       By way of illustration, Example 2.2.2 reflects the application of the
         procedures described in paragraphs 1. and 2. above as it would relate
         to the Company's monthly balance sheets for the six monthly periods
         ending June 30, 2001. The balance sheet for each of the monthly periods
         shown in Example 2.2.2 was prepared in accordance with the books and
         records of the Company. Should any such balance sheet be determined to
         not properly reflect the amounts recorded on the books and accounts of
         the Company in all material respects, an adjustment to the baseline
         Working Capital amount shall be made to correctly reflect the
         applicable balance sheet amounts.

                  (i) to a Permitted Transferee; or

                  (ii) to a bona fide financial institution in connection with
         the grant of a pledge or other encumbrance securing a bona fide loan so
         long as the pledgee agrees in writing prior to the creation of the

         foreclosure of any Shares upon any foreclosure or otherwise, such
         Shares and the pledgee thereof shall remain and become subject to the
         restrictions contained in this Agreement.

         Executive Officer of the Company in writing prior to such transaction;

                  (ii) to a Permitted Transferee;

                  (iii) pursuant to any tender or exchange offer made pursuant

         stockholders of the Company by the Board of Directors or (B) with
         respect to which the Board of Directors has stated it will remain
         neutral and has taken action to redeem its Rights Plan, (it being
         understood that none of Newco or any subsequent Holder shall tender its
         Shares pursuant to such tender or exchange offer until the Company has
         publicly taken a position to recommend such offer or has stated that it
         will remain neutral and has taken action to redeem the Rights Plan) in
         accordance with Rule 14e-2 of the Exchange Act, any successor
         regulation or otherwise;

                  (iv) to a bona fide financial institution in connection with
         the grant of a pledge or other encumbrance securing a bona fide loan so
         long as the pledgee agrees in writing prior to the creation of the
         pledge that upon any transfer to the pledgee or purchaser at
         foreclosure of any Shares upon any foreclosure or otherwise, such
         Shares and the pledgee thereof shall remain and become subject to the
         restrictions contained in this Agreement;

                  (v) to a Third Person pursuant to bona fide open market
         "brokers' transactions" as permitted by the provisions of Rule 144
         under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to the provisions of
         clause (k) thereof); provided, however, that none of Newco or any
         subsequent Holder shall effect a Disposition under this clause (v) if
         such Person knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that such Third
         Person and such Third Person's Affiliates, or any group of which such
         Third Person may be a member holds in the aggregate more than (a) 5%,
         if such Third Person is not entitled to file a Schedule 13G with
         respect to the ownership of Voting Securities of the Company and (b)
         10% if and for so long as such Third Person is entitled to file a
         Schedule 13G with respect to the ownership of Voting Securities of the
         Company (any such Third Person who would hold in excess of the
         referenced percentage being referred to herein as a "PROHIBITED
         HOLDER") of the outstanding Voting Securities after such transaction;

                  (vi) to a Third Person (other than a Competitor) in a valid
         private placement to a Person that (A) Newco or the subsequent Holder
         reasonably believes after due inquiry would not be a Prohibited Holder
         following such transaction and obtains a written representation from
         the purchaser to that effect or (B) agrees in writing to be bound by
         the terms of this Agreement and the Board of Directors approves such
         transaction; or

                  (vii) pursuant to an underwritten public offering under the
         Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights
         Agreement, pursuant to which the managing underwriter agrees to effect
         the sale of the Voting Securities in a manner which shall effect a
         broad distribution thereof and provided that neither


                                       12
<PAGE>   98
         Newco nor any subsequent Holder shall effect a Disposition in an
         underwritten public offering if such Person knows or has reasonable
         grounds to believe that a Third Person purchasing Shares in the
         offering is a Competitor or would be a Prohibited Holder after giving
         effect to the purchase (other than the underwriters or any selected
         dealers).

         (c) Restrictions on Transfer to a Competitor. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6, neither Newco nor any subsequent Holder shall effect
any Disposition of any Shares to a Competitor until after the tenth anniversary
of the Closing Date.

         (d) Restrictions on Transfer to Prohibited Holders. Neither Newco nor
any subsequent Holder shall effect a Disposition of any Shares, if such Person
knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the purchaser would be a
Prohibited Holder after giving effect to such Disposition until after the tenth
anniversary of the Closing Date.

         (e) Right of First Refusal.

                  (i) At any time that Newco and the subsequent Holders
         collectively own 8% or more of the total outstanding Voting Securities,
         notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, during the
         Standstill Period, neither Newco or any subsequent Holder (a "SELLING
         HOLDER") shall effect any Disposition (other than to a Permitted
         Transferee) of more than 1,000,000 Shares in the aggregate in any
         twelve month period without first making an offer in writing in
         accordance with this Section 6(e) to sell such Shares to the Company at
         the Offer Price or the Market Price, as applicable, and upon such other
         bona fide terms and conditions upon which the Selling Holder proposes
         to make such Disposition (the "OFFER"). Upon receipt of such Offer
         (which shall also set forth the proposed method of payment, the amount
         and class of Shares to be sold, the identity (if known) of the Person
         to whom the Selling Holder proposes to effect the Disposition of such
         Shares, the other material terms (to the extent known) upon which such
         Disposition is to be made and all other relevant information reasonably
         requested by the Company), the Company shall have 10 days to accept
         such Offer by delivering a written notice to the Selling Holder
         irrevocably electing to purchase all, but not less than all, of the
         Shares covered thereby; provided, however, that if the proposed
         Disposition is to be made pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made
         pursuant to Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act which is recommended to
         the stockholders of the Company by the Board of Directors or with
         respect to which the Company remains neutral and has taken action to
         redeem the Rights Plan in accordance with Rule 14e-2 of the Exchange
         Act, any successor regulation or otherwise, the Company shall have one
         day less than the number of days remaining before such tender or
         exchange offer, as it may be amended, expires to accept such Offer and
         notify the Selling Holder of the number of Shares the Company is
         electing to purchase. If the Company elects to accept such Offer, the
         closing of the purchase pursuant thereto shall occur, with payment in
         immediately available funds, on the latest of (i) 5 days after the
         acceptance by the Company of such Offer, (ii) the closing date provided
         for in the Offer or (iii) the end of such period of time as the Company
         and the Selling Holder may reasonably require in order to comply with




                                       13
<PAGE>   99


         applicable laws and regulations. Transfers pursuant to Section 6(a),
         6(b)(i), 6(b)(ii) and 6(b)(iv) hereof are not subject to the provisions
         of this Section 6(e).

                  (ii) If the Offer specifies that the Shares are to be sold in
         the market in a method whereby the price cannot be determined at the
         time of the making of the Offer (a "MARKET SALE"), the purchase price
         for the Shares proposed to be sold shall be equal to the greater of (i)
         the negotiated price, if any, between the Company and the Selling
         Holder and (ii) the Market Price of such Shares on the date of such
         Offer. Market Sales shall be deemed to be for cash.

                  (iii) If the purchase price specified in the Offer includes
         any property other than cash, such purchase price shall be deemed to be
         the amount of any cash included in the purchase price plus the value
         (determined as provided below) of such other property included in such
         price. The value of any non-cash property shall be determined in the
         following manner:

                           A. The value of securities which are publicly traded
                  shall be deemed to be the Market Price of such securities on
                  the date of the Offer; and

                           B. The value of any other property shall be
                  determined by an appropriate expert mutually selected by the
                  Company and the Selling Holder. The determination of the
                  dollar value of the non-cash consideration at issue by any
                  such expert shall be made promptly (but in no event more than
                  15 business days after receipt of the Offer) and shall be
                  conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.

                  (iv) The Disposition to any Third Party of such Voting
         Securities shall not be made until such determination referred to in
         Section 6(e)(iii)(B) has been completed and delivered to all the
         parties hereto. The Company shall have the later of (i) five business
         days after the receipt of such determination by the expert referred to
         in Section 6(e)(iii)(B) and (ii) the applicable time period set forth
         in Section 6(e)(i) within which to accept such Offer.

                  (v) If the Company has not exercised its option to purchase
         the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Selling Holder shall be free, for
         a period of 60 days (or, if longer, 60 days from the effective date of
         a registration statement under the Securities Act, if such registration
         is required) from the date of the Company's rejection of the Offer
         (which, unless the Company shall have given written notice of its
         rejection of the Offer, shall be deemed to have occurred on the last
         day on which the Company could accept the Offer in accordance
         herewith), to sell all of the Shares proposed to be sold to the third
         party transferee, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at a
         price equal to or greater than the price specified in the Offer and in
         the manner and on terms no less favorable to the Selling Holder than
         were specified in the Offer. If the Shares are not sold within such
         60-day period, they shall again become subject to the procedures
         provided in this Section 6. If the Shares are sold pursuant to the
         Offer, then the Selling Holder shall give the Company written notice
         promptly upon such Disposition by the Selling Holder.

         (f) Notice of Disposition. To the extent that a Disposition of Shares
hereunder was not subject to Section 6(e) above, Newco or the subsequent Holder,
as the case may be, shall give the Company prompt written notice after such
Disposition by such Person and shall describe in reasonable detail in such
notice the provisions of this Section 6 pursuant to which such Disposition was
effected and the detail relating to the sale (including the amount and class of
Shares to be sold, the identity (if known) of the Person to whom such Person
effected the Disposition of such Shares, the other material terms (to the extent
known) upon which such Disposition was made and all other relevant information
reasonably requested by the Company).

         (g) Excluded Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Sections 6(a) through (f), the ___________ [the approximately 600,000 Shares
owned by Newco on the date of the Merger Agreement] owned by Newco on the date
of this Agreement shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections 6(a)
through (f) of this Agreement.

         (h) Dispositions Null and Void. Dispositions of Shares in violation of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be null and void and the Shares subject
to such Disposition shall remain subject to this Agreement.

         SECTION 7. LEGEND ON CERTIFICATES.

         (a) Legend. Each of Newco and the subsequent Holders hereby
acknowledges and agrees that each of the certificates representing the Shares
held by such Person shall be subject to stop transfer instructions and shall
include the following legend:


         THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY IF REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE. THESE
SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON TRANSFER AND A VOTING AGREEMENT SET
FORTH IN A STOCKHOLDER'S AGREEMENT DATED AS OF ___________, 200__ BETWEEN
TRINITY INDUSTRIES, INC. AND NEWCO. A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE WITH THE
SECRETARY OF TRINITY INDUSTRIES, INC.

         (b) Removal of Legends. Within one business day after receipt by the
Company of a written demand by Newco, a Family Affiliate or subsequent Holder,
the Company agrees to instruct the transfer agent to (i) terminate the stop
transfer instructions and remove the legend with respect to Shares being
transferred pursuant to Section 6(b)(v) or 6(b)(vi) of this Agreement, (ii)
terminate stop transfer instructions and remove all but the first sentence of
the above legend with respect to Shares being transferred pursuant to Section
6(b)(i) or 6(b)(iii), and (iii) remove the first sentence of the above legend if
the Company is furnished an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Company that such Shares may be freely transferred under applicable securities
laws, but only with respect to the Shares being transferred.

         SECTION 8. DIRECTORS DESIGNATED BY THE HOLDERS.


         (a) Nomination of Designee. As promptly as practicable after the
Closing Date, and subject to applicable law, the Company shall take or cause to
be taken all necessary actions to appoint or elect to the Board of Directors,
and at each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the
Closing Date and prior to the termination of the Standstill Period, for so long
as Newco, the Family Affiliates and the subsequent Holders own in the aggregate
more than 7.5% of the then outstanding Voting Securities of the Company, the
Company shall nominate, or cause to be nominated Craig Duchossois as a member of
the Board of Directors. If Craig Duchossois or any Successor Designee is unable
or unwilling at any time to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, then
the holders of a majority of the Shares then held by Newco, the Family
Affiliates and the subsequent Holders may provide the Company written notice
containing the name of a proposed Successor Designee (as determined by the
holders of a majority of the Shares then held by Newco, the Family Affiliates
and the subsequent Holders) and all information required by Regulation 14A and
Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act with respect to such proposed Successor
Designee. If the proposed Successor Designee is an Acceptable Designee, then,
subject to applicable law, the Company shall nominate, or cause to be nominated
the Successor Designee as a member of the Board of Directors.


         (b) Election of Designee. Subject to applicable law, during the
Standstill Period, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the
election of the Designee to the Board of Directors at the next meeting of the
Company's stockholders at which directors are to be elected, and the Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the reelection of the Designee to the
Board of Directors at each meeting of stockholders of the Company at which the
Designee's term as a director for election will expire. Reasonable efforts under
this clause (b) shall include the solicitation of proxies in favor of the
election of the Designee, it being understood that efforts consistent with those
used for other members of the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of
Directors shall be deemed reasonable.


         (c) Resignation of Designee. Newco shall take all actions necessary to
cause the Designee to resign immediately (i) upon the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date if the Standstill Period is not extended as provided for herein and
the Board of Directors requests the Designee's resignation or (ii) upon the
tenth anniversary of the Closing Date if the Standstill Period is extended as
provided in Section 1 and the Board of Directors requests the Designee's
resignation.


         (d) Nomination for Filling Vacancies. During the Standstill Period, if
and so long as Newco and the subsequent Holders own in the aggregate 19.9% of
the then outstanding Voting Securities of the Company, the holders of a majority
of the Shares held by Newco and the subsequent Holders may recommend (as
determined by the holders of a majority of the Shares held by such Persons) to
the Company a potential nominee to fill the vacancy on the Board of Directors;
provided, however, the Company is not obligated to nominate such potential
nominee.

         SECTION 9. NEWCO RESPONSIBLE FOR FAMILY AFFILIATES AND PERMITTED
TRANSFEREES.


         Newco shall cause each of the Family Affiliates and Permitted
Transferees to comply with the terms of this Agreement, and Newco shall be
responsible for any failure by the Family Affiliates and Permitted Transferees
to comply with such terms.

         SECTION 10. FILING NOTIFICATION.


         To the extent that any of Newco, a Family Affiliate, subsequent Holder
or the Company is required to make any filings with the Commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such party shall give the
other parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such filings
prior to the filing thereof with the Commission.

         SECTION 11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.


         Each of the parties hereto recognizes and acknowledges that this
Agreement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated in the Merger
Agreement, that the Company would not have entered into the Merger Agreement
unless this Agreement was executed and that a breach by a party of any covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement shall cause the other party to sustain
injury for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages.
Therefore each of the parties hereto agrees that in the event of any such
breach, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific
performance of such covenants and agreements and agreements and preliminary and
permanent injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity, and the parties hereto further
agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief.

         SECTION 12. AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION.


         This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented only by
written agreement of the Company and the holders of at least a majority of the
Shares held by the Holders.

         SECTION 13. NOTICES.

                  (a) Subject to the terms hereof (and except as otherwise
         provided in Section 2.11), at any time and from time to time after the
         second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Holder(s) may

         shares of Registrable Securities intended to be offered and sold (which
         amount shall be no less than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand
         (2,500,000) shares of Common Stock), (ii) express the present intention

         be offered and sold and (ii) contain the undertaking of the Holder to
         provide all such information and materials and take all such action as
         may be required in order to permit Parent to comply with all applicable
         requirements



                                       3
<PAGE>   114

         of the SEC and to obtain any desired acceleration of the effective date
         of such Demand Registration.

                  (b) As soon as practicable after receipt of a Request, Parent
         shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly effect such Demand
         Registration (including, without limitation, filing post-effective
         amendments, appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky laws
         or other compliance).

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent shall not be
         obligated to cause any special audit to be undertaken in connection
         with any Demand Registration and (ii) Parent shall be entitled to
         postpone for a reasonable period of time the filing of any Demand
         Registration otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it (A) to
         the extent necessary to prepare the financial statements of Parent for
         the fiscal period most recently ended prior to the Request; (B) if
         filing a Demand Registration would materially adversely affect
         (including, without limitation, through the premature disclosure
         thereof) a proposed financing, reorganization, recapitalization,
         merger, consolidation or similar transaction; or (C) if Parent notifies
         the Holders participating in the Request that in the good faith
         judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent, such registration would
         be seriously detrimental to Parent, and the Board of Directors of
         Parent has concluded to defer the filing of such registration
         statement; provided, however, that in the event of a delay pursuant to
         clause (B), Parent shall not be entitled to delay the filing for more
         than ninety (90) days and in the event of a delay pursuant to clause
         (C), Parent shall not be entitled to delay the filing for more than one
         hundred eighty (180) days.

                  (d) Parent shall be obligated to register Registrable
         Securities for the Holders pursuant to this Section 2.1 on two
         occasions only.

                  (e) Notwithstanding any request for a Demand Registration,
         Parent, at its sole option, may initiate a registration for Common
         Stock for its own account relating to an Underwritten Public Offering.
         In such event, any outstanding request by the Holders for a Demand
         Registration shall immediately be converted into a right to sell
         Registrable Securities pursuant to and subject to Section 2.2 hereof
         and shall not be considered a Demand Registration.

                  (f) For purposes of this Section 2.1, Parent shall be entitled
         to accept as a valid Request from the Holders a Request from Newco (or
         from Mr. Craig Duchossois if Newco no longer exists or ceases to be
         controlled by Mr. Richard Duchossois, or from the person designated by
         the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then
         outstanding if Mr. Craig Duchossois is unable or unwilling to so
         serve).

2.2      Parent Registration.

                  (a) Subject to the terms hereof (and except as otherwise
         provided in Section 2.10), if at any time or from time to time after
         the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
         determine to register any of its Common Stock for its own account
         relating to an Underwritten Public Offering, Parent shall:

                           (i) promptly, but in any event at least thirty (30)
                  days before Parent files a registration statement pursuant to
                  an Underwritten Public Offering, give to each Holder written
                  notice thereof; and



                                       4
<PAGE>   115

                           (ii) include in such registration (a "PIGGY-BACK
                  REGISTRATION") (and any related qualification under blue sky
                  laws or other compliance), and in the underwriting involved
                  therein, such Registrable Securities as each Holder may
                  request in a writing delivered to Parent within twenty (20)
                  days after the delivery of Parent's written notice delivered
                  pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) above.

                  (b) Parent shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
         Piggy-Back Registration initiated by it under this Section 2.2 prior to
         the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Holder has
         elected to include its Registrable Securities in such registration,
         provided, however, that in such event, Parent shall promptly pay all
         reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Holders (including,
         without limitation, all reasonable fees and disbursements of one law
         firm chosen to represent the Holders) incurred in connection with such
         terminated registration.

                  (c) Without limiting the generality or effect of any other
         provision hereof, Parent shall not be required to effect any Piggy-Back
         Registration pursuant to this Section 2.2 incidental to the
         registration of any of its securities in connection with mergers,
         acquisitions, exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend
         reinvestment plans or stock option or other employee benefit plans.

2.3      Underwriting.

                  (a) The underwriter or underwriters of any Demand Registration
         shall be selected by the Holders delivering the Request, which
         underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent,
         and the underwriter or underwriters of any Piggy-Back Registration
         shall be selected by Parent. Each Holder's rights under this Article 2
         shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation as a
         Participating Holder in such underwriting, and the inclusion of
         Registrable Securities in the underwriting shall be limited to the
         extent provided herein. Parent, each Participating Holder and all other
         Selling Stockholders shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
         customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such
         Underwritten Public Offering as provided above. If a Holder refuses to
         enter into, and perform such Holder's obligations as a Participating
         Holder under, such underwriting agreement, then the Registrable
         Securities held by such Holder will not be included in any registration
         effected pursuant thereto.

                  (b) If the managing underwriter for a Piggy-Back Registration
         determines in its reasonable judgment that the inclusion of such
         Registrable Securities would materially adversely affect such offering,
         the managing underwriter may limit some or all of the Registrable
         Securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting as
         follows: the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in
         the registration and underwriting by a Participating Holder shall be
         determined by multiplying the number of shares of securities of all
         Selling Stockholders that the managing underwriter is willing to
         include in such registration and underwriting, times a fraction, the
         numerator of which is the number of Registrable Securities requested to
         be included in such registration and underwriting by such Participating
         Holder, and the denominator of which is either (i) at any time that the
         Holders hold in the aggregate less than 15% of the then-outstanding
         shares of Common Stock, the total number of securities that all Selling
         Stockholders have requested to have included in such registration and
         underwriting, or (ii) at any time that the Holders hold in the
         aggregate at



                                       5
<PAGE>   116

         least 15% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock, the total
         number of securities that all Qualified Selling Stockholders have
         requested to have included in such registration and underwriting. To
         facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above
         provisions, Parent may round the number of shares allocable to any such
         Participating Holder to the nearest one hundred (100) shares. If any
         Participating Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting,
         it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to Parent and the
         managing underwriter, delivered not less than seven days before the
         effective date of such registration.

2.4 Expenses of Registration. All Registration Expenses incurred in connection
with all registrations pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 shall be borne by
Parent. Unless otherwise stated herein, all Selling Expenses relating to
securities registered on behalf of any Participating Holder shall be borne by
such Participating Holder.

2.5 Registration Procedures. In the case of each registration, qualification or
compliance effected by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, Parent will keep each
Participating Holder advised in writing as to the initiation of each
registration, qualification and compliance and as to the completion thereof. At
its expense, Parent shall:

                  (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
         with respect to such securities and use all reasonable efforts to cause
         such registration statement to become and remain effective with respect
         to a registration statement filed regarding an Underwritten Public
         Offering, for the lesser of (i) 90 days or (ii) until the distribution
         described in such registration statement has been completed;

                  (b) furnish to each underwriter participating in the
         Underwritten Public Offering associated with such registration, such
         number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus,
         in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such
         other documents as such underwriter may reasonably request in order to
         facilitate the public sale of the Registrable Securities by such
         underwriter, and promptly furnish to each underwriter and Participating
         Holder notice of any stop-order or similar notice issued by the SEC or
         any state agency charged with the regulation of securities, and notice
         of NYSE or any other securities exchange listing relating to the
         Registrable Securities sought to be registered;

                  (c) furnish prospectuses, including preliminary prospectuses
         and amendments and supplements thereto, to the Participating Holders,
         all in accordance with applicable securities laws;

                  (d) apply to register or otherwise qualify the Registrable
         Securities offered by the Participating Holders or any of them under
         all applicable blue sky laws of any state;

                  (e) notify the Participating Holders promptly of (i) any
         action by the SEC to suspend the effectiveness of such registration
         statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such
         purpose (a "stop order") or (ii) the receipt by Parent of any
         notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
         Registrable Securities included in such registration pursuant to the
         registration statement in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
         threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. Immediately upon
         receipt of any such notice, the Participating Holders shall cease to
         offer or sell any Registrable Securities included in such registration
         pursuant to the registration statement in the jurisdiction to which
         such stop order or suspension relates. Parent shall use all reasonable
         efforts to prevent the issuance of



                                       6
<PAGE>   117

         any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if
         any such stop order is issued or any such qualification and, if any
         such stop order is issued or any such qualification is suspended, to
         obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal or revocation thereof, and
         shall notify the Participating Holders at the earliest practicable date
         of the date on which the Participating Holders may offer and sell
         Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement; and

                  (f) Parent shall notify the Participating Holders promptly of
         the occurrence of any event or the existence of any facts that, in the
         judgment of Parent, should be set forth in such registration statement.
         Immediately upon receipt of such notice, the Participating Holders
         shall cease to offer or sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to
         such registration statement, cease to deliver or use such registration
         statement and, if so requested by the Parent, return to Parent, at
         Parent's expense, all copies (other than permanent file copies) of such
         registration statement. Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, take
         such action as may be necessary to amend or supplement such
         registration statement in order to set forth or reflect such event or
         facts. Parent shall furnish copies of such proposed amendment or
         supplement to the Participating Holders and shall not file or
         distribute such amendment or supplement without the prior consent of
         Participating Holders, which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld.

2.6 Cooperation. In connection with any registration effected by Parent pursuant
to this Agreement, Parent shall

                  (a) enter into such customary agreements (including an
         underwriting agreement containing such representations and warranties
         by Parent and such other terms and provisions, including
         indemnification provisions, as are customarily contained in
         underwriting agreements for comparable offerings) and take all such
         other actions as the Participating Holders or the underwriters, if any,
         participating in such registration may reasonably request in order to
         expedite or facilitate such registration;

                  (b) furnish, at the request of the Participating Holders or
         any underwriter participating in such registration, (i) a comfort
         letter or letters, dated the date of the final prospectus with respect
         to the registration and/or the date of the closing for the registration
         from the independent certified public accountants of Parent and
         addressed to the Participating Holders and any underwriters
         participating in such registration, which letter or letters shall state
         that such accountants are independent with respect to Parent within the
         meaning of Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Ethics of the American
         Institute of Certified Public Accountants and shall address such
         matters as the Participating Holders and underwriters may reasonably
         request and as may be customary in transactions of a similar nature for
         similar entities and (ii) an opinion, dated the date of the closing for
         the registration, of the counsel representing Parent with respect to
         such registration (which counsel may be the General Counsel of Parent
         or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Participating Holders),
         addressed to the Participating Holders and any such underwriters, which
         opinion shall address such matters as they may reasonably request and
         as may be customary in transactions of a similar nature for similar
         entities; and

                  (c) make available for inspection by the Participating
         Holders, the underwriters, if any, participating in such registration
         (which inspecting underwriters shall, if reasonably possible, be
         limited to any manager or managers for such participating
         underwriters), counsel for the Participating Holders, one accountant or
         accounting firm retained by Participating



                                       7
<PAGE>   118

         Holders and any such underwriters, or any other agent retained by the
         Participating Holders or such underwriters, all financial and other
         records, corporate documents and properties of Parent, and supply such
         additional information, as they shall reasonably request; provided that
         any such party shall keep the contents thereof confidential.

2.7 Indemnification.

                  (a) To the extent permitted by law, Parent will indemnify and
         hold harmless each Participating Holder and each of its officers and
         directors and partners, if any, and each person controlling each
         Participating Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
         Act (the "HOLDER INDEMNITEES"), against all expenses, claims, losses,
         damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (including,
         without limitation, reasonable fees and other expenses actually
         incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding)
         (collectively, "LOSSES") to the extent to which such Holder Indemnitee
         is subject, including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of
         any litigation, commenced or threatened, to the extent such Losses
         arise out of or are based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue
         statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement,
         prospectus, offering circular or other document filed with the SEC
         pursuant to this Agreement, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
         incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance effected
         pursuant to this Agreement, or arise out of or are based on any
         omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
         misleading, or any violation by Parent of the Securities Act in
         connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance
         effected pursuant to this Agreement, and Parent will reimburse each
         Holder Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
         in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such Loss;
         provided, however, that the indemnity contained herein shall not apply
         to amounts paid in settlement of any Loss if settlement is effected
         without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not unreasonably be
         withheld); provided, further, that Parent will not be liable in any
         such case to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based on
         any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
         omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
         furnished to Parent expressly for inclusion in such registration by a
         Holder Indemnitee specifically for use therein. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, insofar as the foregoing indemnity relates to any such
         untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged
         omission) made in the preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied
         in the amended prospectus on file with the SEC at the time the
         registration statement becomes effective or in the final prospectus
         filed with the SEC pursuant to the applicable rules of the SEC or in
         any supplement or addendum thereto, the indemnity contained herein
         shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder Indemnitee if a copy of
         the final prospectus filed pursuant to such rules, together with all
         supplements and addenda thereto, was not furnished to the person or
         entity asserting the Loss at or prior to the time required by the
         Securities Act.

                  (b) To the extent permitted by law, each Participating Holder
         will, severally but not jointly, if Registrable Securities held by such
         Participating Holder are included in the securities as to which a
         registration, qualification or compliance is being effected pursuant to
         the terms hereof, indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each of Parent's
         directors and officers, each person who controls Parent within the
         meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each other Selling
         Stockholder, each of such person's officers and directors and each
         person controlling such persons within the meaning of Section 15 of the
         Securities Act (collectively,



                                       8
<PAGE>   119

         the "PARENT INDEMNITEES"), against all Losses to the extent to which
         such Parent Indemnitee is subject, including any of the foregoing
         incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, to
         the extent such Losses arise out of or are based on any untrue
         statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in
         any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other
         document filed with the SEC pursuant to this Agreement, or any
         amendment or supplement thereto incident to any such registration,
         qualification or compliance effected pursuant to the Agreement, or
         arise out of or are based on any omission (or alleged omission) to
         state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
         in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by such
         Participating Holder of the Securities Act in connection with any such
         registration, qualification or compliance effected pursuant to this
         Agreement, and will reimburse each Parent Indemnitee for any legal or
         other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating,
         preparing or defending any such Loss, in each case to the extent, but
         only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue
         statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such
         registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document
         filed with the SEC pursuant to this Agreement in reliance upon and in
         conformity with information furnished to Parent by such Participating
         Holder expressly for inclusion in such registration; provided, however,
         that the indemnity contained herein shall not apply to amounts paid in
         settlement of any Loss if settlement is effected without the consent of
         the Participating Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, insofar as the foregoing
         indemnity relates to any such untrue statement (or alleged untrue
         statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in the preliminary
         prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file
         with the SEC at the time the registration statement becomes effective
         or in the final prospectus filed pursuant to applicable rules of the
         SEC or in any supplement or addendum thereto, the indemnity contained
         herein shall not inure to the benefit of any Parent Indemnitee if a
         copy of the final prospectus filed pursuant to such rules, together
         with all supplements and addenda thereto, was not furnished to the
         person or entity asserting the Loss at or prior to the time required by
         the Securities Act. The liability of a Participating Holder under this
         Section 8(b) shall in no event exceed the proceeds received by it from
         sales of Registrable Securities giving rise to such obligations.

                  (c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section
         2.7 (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give notice to the party required
         to provide indemnification (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") promptly after
         such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any action or proceeding
         commenced against, or written demand made on, any such party in respect
         of which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying
         Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation
         resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party,
         who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be
         approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not
         unreasonably be withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in
         such defense at such party's expense, and provided further that the
         failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
         shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
         Agreement unless the failure to give such notice is materially
         prejudicial to an Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such action;
         and, provided further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the
         defense for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or as
         to which the Indemnifying Party is asserting separate or different
         defenses, which defenses are inconsistent with the defenses of the
         Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such
         claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified
         Party, consent to entry of any judgment or



                                       9
<PAGE>   120

         enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional
         term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
         Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such
         claim or litigation. No Indemnified Party shall consent to entry of any
         judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of each
         Indemnifying Party.

                  (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.7 is
         unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss referred to
         therein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
         Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
         such Indemnified Party as a result of such Loss (i) in such proportion
         as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Parent,
         on the one hand, and all Selling Stockholders, on the other, from the
         offering of Parent's securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by
         clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion
         as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to
         in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of Parent, on the one
         hand, and the Selling Stockholders, on the other, in connection with
         the statements or omissions that resulted in such Loss, as well as any
         other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received
         by Parent, on the one hand, and the Selling Stockholders, on the other,
         shall be the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses)
         received by Parent, on the one hand, and the Selling Stockholders, on
         the other. The relative fault of Parent, on the one hand, and the
         Selling Stockholders, on the other, shall be determined by reference
         to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement
         of material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
         material fact relates to information supplied by Parent or by the
         Selling Stockholders and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge,
         access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
         statement or omission. Parent and the Selling Stockholders agree that
         it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
         Section 2.7(d) were based solely upon the number of entities from whom
         contribution was requested or by any other method of allocation which
         does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above
         in this Section 2.7(d). The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified
         Party as a result of the Loss referred to above in this Section 2.7(d)
         shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
         incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or
         defending any such action or claim, subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.7(c) hereof. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
         (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be
         entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
         fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
         the Securities Act).

2.8 Holdback Agreements. Each Participating Holder, if requested by the managing
underwriter in a registration pursuant to this Agreement, shall not effect any
public sale or distribution of securities of Parent of the same class as the
securities included in such Demand Registration or Piggy-Back Registration,
including a sale pursuant to Rule 144, during such period of time following the
closing date of each offering made pursuant to such Demand Registration or
Piggy-Back Registration as may be requested by Parent or such managing
underwriter. In no event shall such period exceed the shorter of one hundred
eighty (180) days or the shortest period of time so requested from any other
Selling Stockholder that holds more than 5% of the outstanding amount of the
same class of securities as included in such Demand Registration or Piggy-Back
Registration.

2.9 Certain Information. Each Participating Holder agrees, with respect to any
Registrable Securities included in any registration, to furnish to Parent such
information regarding such Participating Holder, the Registrable Securities and
the distribution proposed by such Participating Holder as Parent may reasonably
request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any registration,
qualification or compliance referred to in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

2.10 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain
rules and regulations of the SEC that may at any time permit the sale of
