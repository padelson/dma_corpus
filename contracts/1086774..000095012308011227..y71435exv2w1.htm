Schedule (the costs and expenses of which, if any, shall be borne solely by the Company or, if the
Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation); <U>provided</U> that the failure to obtain any

additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry

Company and Parent each agree to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or competition Laws
that may be asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-United States antitrust or competition
authority, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as

decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
each of the Company and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and
all steps necessary to vacate or lift any order relating to antitrust or competition that would
have the effect of making any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
otherwise prohibiting or materially delaying their consummation. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, &#147;reasonable best efforts&#148; shall impose on the
Company and its Subsidiaries the obligation to pay filing, application and similar fees but shall
not impose on the Company or its Subsidiaries any obligation to make payments, incur liabilities or

any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule constitute an admission of fault, culpability or

the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or

such party understands and has considered the implications of the foregoing waiver; (iii)&nbsp;such

Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties,
except that Merger Sub may assign any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent incorporated in Delaware if
such assignment would not cause a delay in the consummation of the Merger or have an adverse effect
on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub (or such designee) to consummate the Merger, but no such
assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

incurred by Parent and Merger Sub, and that Parent and Merger Sub would not have any adequate
remedy at Law, in the event that the Company failed to perform its agreements and covenants

Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the United States District Court for Delaware or in any state court in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent and Merger Sub are entitled at
Law or in equity. Each party further agrees that neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section&nbsp;9.09, and the Company
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or otherwise, the
Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to
