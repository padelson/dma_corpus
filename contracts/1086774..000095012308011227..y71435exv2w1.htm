 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Merger_   

  

 SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined hereafter). Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, Boston, MA, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

   

 SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

   

 SECTION 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

   

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.06 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of such directors to hold office, subject to the applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 SECTION 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, such officers to hold office, subject to the applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on the Securities of the Constituent Corporations_   

  

 SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of Capital Stock of Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each a " _Company Common Share_ " and collectively, the " _Company Common Stock_ ") and each share of Company Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 3.03) held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including as part of an IDS unit) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _Company Capital Stock; Determination of Merger Consideration_. Each Company Common Share, including the Company Common Shares represented by the IDSs (as defined hereafter), outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than the Dissent Shares, as defined hereafter, and shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)), by virtue of the Merger, shall be converted into a right to receive $0.01 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to dissent from the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenters  Rights Statute_"), who did not vote in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who complies in all other respects with the Dissenters Rights Statute shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c) (" _Dissent Shares_ "), but rather the holders of Dissent Shares shall be entitled to the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissent Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of the fair value under the Dissenters Rights Statute, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissent Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any objections, notices of intent to dissent or demands received by the Company pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. Each holder of Dissent Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute. 

  

 SECTION 2.02 _Payment for Company Common Shares_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall appoint an agent, subject to Parents approval of the terms and conditions of such appointment (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), which shall be the Companys agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid in accordance with Section 2.01. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Company Common Shares at the Effective Time who has not already surrendered their Company Common Shares and delivered a letter of transmittal prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each certificate previously representing a Company Common Share (directly or indirectly as part of an IDS) (a " _Certificate_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.04) or in the case of Company Common Shares rep- 

   ##### 

  

   

resented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), upon the adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, such
letter of transmittal to be in the form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 2.04) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such Company Common Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. 

   

 (b) Upon the surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.04) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal or the letter of transmittal distributed in connection with the Debt Tender Offer, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (before giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(g)) equal to (x) the number of Company Common Shares represented by such Certificate or book-entry (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.04) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the transferred Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other fees or Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such fee or Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Common Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Company Common Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Common Shares, in any case without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Common Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the 

   ##### 

  

   

extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a) to pay for Company Common Shares, for which appraisal rights have been perfected and have not been withdrawn or lost 30 days after the Effective Time, shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

   

 (g) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 SECTION 2.03 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company Common Shares shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination or exchange of Company Common Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period or issuer tender or exchange offer or similar transaction (excluding any such change as a result of any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase Company Common Shares granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or arrangements), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   

 SECTION 2.04 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Company Common Shares, as contemplated by this Article II. 

   

 SECTION 2.05 _Effect on Units_. 

   

 (a) As of the Effective Time, each IDS separated in connection with the tender of Notes pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer shall entitle the holder thereof to receive (i) for the underlying Company Common Share, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), (ii) for the underlying Note (or portion thereof) accepted for payment in the Debt Tender Offer, the Debt Tender Consideration and (iii) for the underlying Note (or portion thereof) not accepted for payment in the Debt Tender Offer, a new Subordinated Note of the Surviving Corporation representing the amount thereof which will remain outstanding. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any IDS, each issued and outstanding IDS that has not been separated in connection with the tender of Notes pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer shall be converted into an IDS of the Surviving Corporation consisting of the right to receive the Merger Consideration (in accordance with Section 2.01(c)) and one Subordinated Note of the Surviving Corporation. After the Effective Time, in order to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share underlying an IDS that has not be separated in connection with the tender of Notes pursuant to the Debt Tender, the holder must surrender such IDS for separation and the underlying Common Shares as described in Section 2.02. 

   

ARTICLE III

conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Company Proposal and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its
agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the
Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or
destroy all such information. For purposes of this Agreement " _Company
Proposal_ " shall mean (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 33-1/3% or more of (A) the
equity securities, debt securities or IDSs of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
outside the ordinary course of business, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the agreements to be executed
in connection herewith. 

   

 (b) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (and shall not permit any committee thereof to) (i) (A) withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, adoption or recommendation by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the Merger or fail to recommend to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement that they approve the Merger or (B) endorse, approve, adopt, submit to Company shareholders (including by seeking to obtain an action by written consent of some or all of the Companys shareholders) or recommend, or propose publicly to endorse, approve, adopt, submit to shareholders of the Company or recommend, any Company Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) enter into, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.03(c)) (any such document, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement, a Notice of Superior Proposal, a notice of any Company Proposal (whether or not the Board of Directors of the Company determines that it is a Superior Proposal or reasonably expects that it would result in a Superior Proposal), any other notice required by this Section 5.03 or any disclosure thereof shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Board of Directors may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change for any reason other than in response to a Company Proposal and (B) subject to the provisions of Section 5.03(e), the Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, at any time prior to the adoption and approval of the Merger by the Companys shareholders, may, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 5.03(a), in response to a Third Partys bona fide written Company Proposal that the Board of Directors determines constitutes, or is reasonably expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, (i) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, and furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or afford such Third Party access to, the business, properties, assets, books or records of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, 

   ##### 

  

   

otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort by, such Third Party and its auditors,
advisors and lenders (subject to a confidentiality agreement (including a
customary standstill) with terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined hereafter)), (ii)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) take any action that any
court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take but, in the case
of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B)(i) and (B)(ii), only if the Board of
Directors, after considering the advice from outside legal counsel to
the Company, determines in good faith that it should take such action to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to a Company Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes under this Agreement, including Article VIII, any disclosure by the Board of Directors of the status of any Company Proposal (without comment on the merits thereof) shall not be considered a failure to make, withdrawal or modification adverse to Parent or Merger Sub of its Company Board Recommendation. 

   

 (e) The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (B)(i) and (B)(ii) of Section 5.03(c) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) in writing of any Company Proposal, which notice shall state the material terms and conditions of any such Company Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Company Proposal as well as the Companys intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person or group. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any Company Proposal. The Company shall provide to Parent any information provided to such Third Party that has not been previously provided to Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide, written Company Proposal made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement for at least a majority of the outstanding Company Common Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, and which the Board of Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Company Proposal, determines in good faith is more favorable to all the Companys shareholders than as provided hereunder. 

   

 SECTION 5.04 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will provide current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) as of the Effective Time who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation (" _Employees_ ") with base salary, the opportunity for cash bonus compensation, and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided under the Companys compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, practices and arrangements (excluding equity-based programs) in effect at the Effective Time (it being understood that discretionary incentive programs will remain discretionary); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan, program or ar- 

   ##### 

  

   

rangement, require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment
in the securities of the Surviving Corporation or interfere with the
Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason
for which the Company could have terminated such Employee prior to the
Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates will honor all Employee Benefit Plans and employment agreements (including any severance, retention, change of control and similar plans, agreements and written arrangements) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such plans, agreements or written arrangements. 

   

 (c) For all purposes under the employee benefits plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time (including predecessor or other entities for which the Company and its Affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan, except for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit plans, for any purpose where service credit for the applicable period is not provided to participants generally, and to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, (i) each Employee immediately will be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for the purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or inapplicable under any Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (d) The terms and provisions of this Section 5.04 are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their respective or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the parties to confer Third Party beneficiary rights upon any other Person. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to and shall not establish or create or amend any employee benefit plan, practice or program of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns and shall not create any contract of employment.

ARTICLE VI 

   

 _Additional Agreements_   

  

 SECTION 6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (b) the obtaining of all necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings promptly (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder, (c) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties set forth on Sections 3.04 and 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the costs and expenses of which, if any, shall be borne solely by the Company or, if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation); _provided_ that the failure to obtain any such consents, approvals or waivers shall not constitute a breach by the Company of any covenants or representations or, except with respect to the consents, approvals and waivers required by Section 7.02(f), the failure of any condition contained in this Agreement, (d) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or questioning the validity or legality of the Merger, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed and (e) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent each agree to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or competition Laws that may be asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-United States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise the sale or disposition of such of its assets or businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, each of the Company and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate or lift any order relating to antitrust or competition that would have the effect of making any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting or materially delaying their consummation. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, "reasonable best efforts" shall impose on the Company and its Subsidiaries the obligation to pay filing, application and similar fees but shall not impose on the Company or its Subsidiaries any obligation to make payments, incur liabilities or grant contractual or other concessions to counterparties in order to secure any consents, waivers, approvals or authorizations. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 6.02 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and hold harmless, to the same extent provided under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date hereof, the individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time. All obligations with respect to all rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the respective Certificates of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in Section 6.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, unless such modification is required by Law. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have obtained, and for a six-year period thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, a so-called "tail" policy for such six-year period covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Companys directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this Section 6.02 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have pursuant to any indemnification agreements or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in Section 6.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.02. 

   

 (e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.02 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.02 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.02 applies shall be Third Party beneficiaries of this Section 6.02). 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 6.03 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that the Company or, if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing fees for any applicable foreign or supranational antitrust Laws and all Separation Fees. Except to the extent provided in Section 2.02(c), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, stock transfer, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent. " _Expenses_ ", as used in this Agreement, shall include all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the preparation, printing and filing of the Proxy Statement and the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of stockholder approvals, the preparation, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents and all other matters related to the closing of the Merger and the other Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 6.04 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or court process. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore reasonably agreed to by the parties. 

   

 SECTION 6.05 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from or sent by such party to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly cooperate and consult with one another with respect to the preparation and submission of any filings, communications or correspondence with any Governmental Authority to the extent practicable and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and any restrictions under antitrust Law. 

   

 SECTION 6.06 _Access to Information_. 

   

 (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, to the extent consistent with applicable antitrust and other Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and each 

   ##### 

  

   

of their respective officers, directors and employees, counsel, advisors,
accountants, financial advisors, lenders and representatives (collectively,
the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, provide Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective officers, employees, counsel, advisors, accountants,
financial advisors, financial sources, Affiliates and representatives
(collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the officers,
directors, employees, accountants, properties, offices and other facilities
and to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as will
permit Parent and Merger Sub to make inspections of such as either of them
may reasonably require, and will cause the Company Representatives and the
Companys Subsidiaries to (i) furnish Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent
Representatives to the extent available with such financial and operating
data and other information with respect to the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent and Merger Sub may from time to
time reasonably request and (ii) notify Parent of the filing by the Company
of any form, report, schedule, statement, registration statement and other
documents filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries during such period
pursuant to the requirements of the United States federal or state securities
Laws. All legal, accounting and business due diligence shall have been
completed prior to the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub confirm that (i) the Company has provided Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Representatives with access to such documents, books, records, facilities, contracts and other assets of the Company as any of them has requested to review, (ii) each of them has had the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management of the Company, to acquire such additional information about the Company as Parent and Merger Sub and the Parent Representatives have requested and (iii) each of them has had the opportunity to conduct a complete due diligence process; all such information that has been provided to Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent Representatives is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement (as hereinafter defined). In connection with such investigation, Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Representatives have received from the Company or the Company Representatives certain other estimates, projections and other forecasts for the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain estimates, plans and budget information. 

   

 SECTION 6.07 _Company Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), neither the Company nor any other Person has made, nor shall the Company or any other Person be deemed to have made, any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made by the Company and contained in Article III of this Agreement, neither the Company, any holder of the Companys securities nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their representatives or Affiliates with respect to: 

    

 (i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter de- 

   ##### 

  

   

livered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives or Affiliates; or 

   

 (ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives or Affiliates. 

  

 SECTION 6.08 _Financing for Parent and Merger Sub_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using their reasonable best efforts to: (i) satisfy, on a timely basis, all conditions within their control applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing, (ii) comply with all obligations applicable to Parent and Merger Sub, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including any terms and conditions contained in the "flex provisions" related to the Debt Financing), (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing and (v) seek to enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters. Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted, upon prior written notice to the Company, to amend, supplement, modify or waive any provision or remedy under the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing; provided that (x) no such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall add or make more onerous any conditions to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date and (y) any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver that could reasonably be expected to materially impede, delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger shall require the prior written consent of the Company. In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or any financing source notifies Parent that it no longer intends to provide Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain all or such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative sources (such portion from alternative sources, the " _Alternative Financing_ ") or replace such Debt Financing with equity financing in an amount sufficient, when combined with the funds under the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter (if any), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on (A) terms and conditions (other than those relating to conditions to the funding thereof), not materially less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent and Merger Sub) and (B) terms and conditions relating to conditions to the funding thereof, not more onerous to Parent or Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Company), in each case, in the aggregate than the Debt Financing (taking into account the "flex provisions" related to the Debt Financing) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in all cases at or prior to Closing. Parent shall provide to the Company executed copies of the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing and any commitment letter related to any alternate financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and any alternate financing and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if at any time (i) the Commitment Letters shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to the Commitment Letters or 

    ##### 

  

    

any alternate financing notifies Parent that such source no longer intends to
provide financing to Parent on the terms set forth therein, or (iii) for any
reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters or
any alternate financing on the terms described therein. Parent shall not, and
shall not permit Merger Sub to, without the prior written consent of
the Company, take (or fail to take) any action or enter into any transaction,
including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease,
contract or debt or equity financing, which taking (or failure to take) could
reasonably be expected to materially impede, delay or prevent consummation of
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters or any alternate
financing. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their Company Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, at Parents sole cost and expense, including (i) assisting in the preparation for, and participating in, meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies on a customary basis with reasonable advance notice, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing to the extent of information related to the Company, (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, opinions or documents required by the Debt Commitment Letters or as may be otherwise reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral at the Effective Time, (iv) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources with the financial statements and financial data of the Company financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit reports and other information relating to the Company of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC required by the Debt Commitment Letters or as may be otherwise reasonably requested by Parent, (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys, appraisals, environmental reports and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, (vi) obtaining any necessary rating agencies confirmation or approvals for the Debt Financing, and (vii) taking all corporate actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing;  _provided_ that none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time except for any liabilities that are conditioned on the Effective Time having occurred. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with its cooperation with the Debt Financing. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith). For purposes of this Section 6.08(b), the term "Debt Financing" shall also be deemed to include any Alternative Financing and the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall also be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to such Alternative Financing.

 SECTION 6.09 _Debt Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) Simultaneously with the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company shall commence a tender offer for 70% of the outstanding Subordinated Notes (a " _Debt Tender Offer_ "), for an amount, in cash, equal to $3.99 per Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest and deferred interest (the " _Debt Tender Consideration_ "), and on such other terms and conditions as may be agreed between the Company and Merger Sub, and a solicitation of the consents of holders of a majority in principal amount of the Subordinated Notes (a " _Consent Solicitation_ ") to an amendment to the indenture governing the terms of the Subordinated Notes (the " _Indenture_ ") in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, with such other changes as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the " _Requisite Consents_ "). Any amounts payable to holders of the Subordinated Notes in the Consent Solicitation or Debt Tender Offer shall be funded by Parent and Merger Sub or by the Surviving Corporation at the direction of Parent at the Effective Time by deposit with a designated agent of immediately available funds equal to the amount to be paid. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Consent Solicitation and Debt Tender Offer shall not require any payment for the Subordinated Notes and/or the consents or waiver or amendment under the Consent Solicitations to be made by the Company prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) In connection with the Consent Solicitation and Debt Tender Offer, the Company shall prepare all reasonably necessary and appropriate documentation, including the offer to purchase, the terms of the consent, related letters of transmittal and other related documents and any other filing that may be required by the SEC or the CSC (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). All mailings to the holders of the Subordinated Notes in connection with the Consent Solicitation and Debt Tender Offer and related filings with the SEC and CSC shall be subject to the prior review and comment of the Company and Merger Sub and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. Merger Sub and the Company shall reasonably cooperate, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate, and Merger Sub and the Company shall each use its respective reasonable best efforts, to cause its respective representatives to reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the Consent Solicitation and Debt Tender Offer (including the preparation of the Offer Documents) and use reasonable best efforts to cause any payment for the Consent Solicitation and the initial settlement of the Debt Tender Offer to occur simultaneously with the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Consents in connection with the Consent Solicitation. Promptly upon receipt of the Requisite Consents permitting an amendment of the Indenture, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture reflecting the amendments to the Indenture approved by such Requisite Consents and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Indenture trustee to promptly enter into such supplemental indenture; _provided_ , that the amendments contained in such supplemental indenture shall become effective upon signing, but not operative until the Closing and the acceptance of the Subordinated Notes tendered in the Debt Tender Offer. The closing of the Consent Solicitation and Debt Tender Offer shall be conditioned solely on (i) the receipt of the Requisite Consents, (ii) the simultaneous occurrence of the Closing and (ii) there being no Restraint that prohibits the Closing. Simultaneously with the Closing and in accordance with the terms of the Consent Solicitation and Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Company (as successor in interest to Merger Sub) shall be provided by Merger Sub with the funds reasonably necessary to consummate such Debt Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation (including the payment of all accrued and 

   ##### 

  

    

unpaid interest, deferred interest, applicable premiums, consent fees and all
related fees and expenses) and the Company shall accept for purchase, and use
such funds to purchase, the Subordinated Notes tendered in such Debt Tender
Offer (and pay all accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest, applicable
premiums, consent fees and all related fees and expenses in connection with
the Debt Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation).

   ##### 

  

    

(B) is not cured by the Company within 30 calendar days following receipt of
written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Parent; or

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or Section 8.01(c)(ii), then (A) the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for their Expenses up to a maximum amount of $2,500,000, within two Business Days of the Companys receipt of reasonable documentation of such Expenses from Parent, and (B) with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii), if at or prior to the date of the Company Meeting a Company Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn and within six months of the Termination Date the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement for a transaction involving an aggregate consideration greater than the Merger Consideration and the Debt Tender Consideration, which transaction subsequently closes, then, upon the closing of such transaction, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid to Parent and Merger Sub an amount equal to $2,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), reduced by any amounts previously paid to Parent and Merger Sub as Expenses pursuant to clause (A). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) or Section 8.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent and Merger Sub an amount equal to the Termination Fee on the Termination Date (in the case of a termination by the Company) or within two Business Days of the Termination Date (in the case of a termination by Parent or Merger Sub). Any payments to Parent and Merger Sub under this Section 8.02(b) will be paid to an account or accounts designated by Parent and will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

  

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii), then Parent shall reimburse the Company for its Expenses (which shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 8.02(c) to include the amount of any fees or expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.09(d)) up to a maximum amount of $2,500,000 within two Business Days of Parents receipt of reasonable documentation of such Expenses from the Company. If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(iii) or Section 8.01(d)(iv) then Parent shall pay the Company, within three Business Days of such termination, a fee of $2,500,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company. 

  

 (d) If a party fails to promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to Section 8.02(b) or 8.02(c), as applicable, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at the rate of 8% per annum. If, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in judgment for such party for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent or the Company be entitled to receive more than one payment of the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable. 

  

 (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that neither the payment of the amounts by the Company specified in Section 8.02(b) nor the payment of the amounts by Parent specified in Section 8.02(c) is a penalty, but in each case is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiat- 

   ##### 

  

    

ing this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of

 SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the Company Shareholders or the approval of the shareholders of Parent without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of any other party or conditions to its obligations contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 SECTION 9.04 _Interpretation_. 

  

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule 

   ##### 

  

    

to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. 

  

 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms of this Agreement to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business. Nor shall the inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule constitute an admission of fault, culpability or liability with respect to any claim, action, lawsuit or proceeding or an admission that any breach, violation, default or event of default exists with respect to any contract or agreement. All capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. Any descriptions of agreements therein are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by the specific terms of such agreements, copies of which have been made available to Parent. The table of contents and all headings contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing any of the provisions contained in either this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule. Certain information in the Company Disclosure Schedule may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. Any such information is included solely for informational purposes, and nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement. It is expressly understood and acknowledged that any exceptions set forth therein shall not constitute a basis for a claim of a breach of any of the representations and warranties or covenants made in this Agreement. The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of materiality thereunder. 

  

 (c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) The parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the product of negotiations between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each provision hereof. Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed strictly or in favor of or against any party hereto but rather shall be given a fair and reasonable construction without regard to the rule of contra proferentem. 

  

 SECTION 9.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 

  

 SECTION 9.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the confidentiality agreement, dated as of May 15, 2008, between Kohlberg Management VI, LLC and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Merger and (b) except for the provisions of Article II and Section 6.02 (which from and after the Effective Time are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Persons referred to therein and by their respective heirs and representatives), are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of the third party beneficiaries under Section 6.02 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.05 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

  

 SECTION 9.07 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement is made pursuant to, and shall be construed, governed by and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of State of Delaware (and the United States federal Law, to the extent applicable), irrespective of the principal place of business, residence or domicile of the parties hereto, and without giving effect to otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware, the United States District Court for Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the Delaware Supreme Court determines that, notwithstanding Section 111 of the DGCL, the Court of Chancery does not have or should not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or 

   ##### 

  

    

other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any other court. 

  

 (c) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver; (ii) such party understands and has considered the implications of the foregoing waiver; (iii) such party makes the foregoing waiver voluntarily; and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.07. 

  

 SECTION 9.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent incorporated in Delaware if such assignment would not cause a delay in the consummation of the Merger or have an adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub (or such designee) to consummate the Merger, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 SECTION 9.09 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would be incurred by Parent and Merger Sub, and that Parent and Merger Sub would not have any adequate remedy at Law, in the event that the Company failed to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the United States District Court for Delaware or in any state court in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent and Merger Sub are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party further agrees that neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.09, and the Company irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or otherwise, the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to obtain other equitable remedies. 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being 

   ##### 

  

    

enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 9.11 _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed a representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent and Merger Sub jointly and all liability and obligations relating thereto shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation of Parent and Merger Sub.
