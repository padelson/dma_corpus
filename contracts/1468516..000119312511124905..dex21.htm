Series B Per Share Amount;  _minus_ (ii) (a) the exercise price of the
applicable Series B Warrant _multiplied by_ (b) the number of shares of Series
B Preferred Stock underlying such Series B Warrant (the " _Series B
Warrant Consideration_ ," and together with the Common Stock Warrant
Consideration, the " _Warrant Consideration_ ").

(b) Upon conversion of the Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 2.6(a),
each holder of a Certificate representing any such Company Capital Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive,
subject to this ARTICLE II and ARTICLE IX, the applicable Merger Consideration
to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.12 hereof (or upon compliance with Section 2.15),
without interest thereon. The Merger Consideration payable to any Stockholder
for whom there are outstanding Stockholder Loans as of the Effective Time
shall be reduced (but not past zero) by the amount of such Stockholder Loans
(which Stockholder Loans shall be discharged to the extent of such reduction
in Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 6.11).

 



15 2.7 _Treatment of Stock Held by the Company_. Any shares of Company
Capital Stock owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof pursuant
to Section 2.6(a), and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each
share of the Company Capital Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall remain outstanding as
shares in the Surviving Corporation, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto, and no conversion thereof shall be made pursuant to Section 2.6(a).

2.8 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) The Company shall comply with all requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL
and shall keep Parent promptly informed of all matters relating thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but only to the
extent required by the DGCL, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by any holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger and is otherwise entitled to demand, and who properly
demands, to receive payment of the fair value for such shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted pursuant to Section 2.6(a) into
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration unless such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise effectively withdraws or loses such holders
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses its right to
demand or receive such payment, such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest thereon,
pursuant to Section 2.6(a).

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and a copy of any
notice of a Stockholders demand for payment or objection to the Merger, of
any request to withdraw a demand for payment and of any other instrument
delivered to it pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) a full
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands, objections and requests (it being understood that, so long as
such demand objection or request is not reasonably likely to relate to an
amount in excess of the then-current Escrow Amount, the Company shall have
the right to control all such negotiations and proceedings prior to the
Closing and the Securityholders Agent shall have the right to control all
such negotiations and proceedings after the Closing). Except with the prior
written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment with respect
to any such demands, objections and requests and neither the Company nor the
Securityholders Agent shall settle (or offer to settle) or otherwise
compromise any such demands, objections and requests or approve any withdrawal
of the same.

2.9 _Stock Options_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE II (including Sections 2.13,
2.18 and 2.19) and except as provided on Section 2.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule,

 



16  immediately following the Effective Time, each Stock Option that is
outstanding and not exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether
or not then vested or exercisable) shall be canceled and extinguished and
converted into only the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest
thereon, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Common Per Share Amount
over (B) the exercise price per share of such Stock Option, _multiplied by_
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock for which such Stock Option remains
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
amount payable in respect of each share of Common Stock covered by such a
Stock Option, the " _Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ that with respect to
each Securityholder who is an Employee, the number of Stock Options designated
on Section 2.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule next to the name of each
such Employee as remaining unvested immediately after the Closing shall remain
outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plan and shall be (I) converted
into options to purchase a number of shares of Parent common stock (the "
_AOL Stock Options_ ") equal to (x) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (such share number rounded down
to four (4) decimal points), and the per share exercise price for Parent
common stock issuable upon exercise of such converted Stock Option shall be
equal to (a) the exercise price per share of Common Stock at which such Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (b)
the Option Exchange Ratio (such exercise price rounded up to two (2) decimal
points) and (II) subject to the post-Closing vesting schedule set forth on
Section 2.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and to such vesting
acceleration provisions applicable in connection with a termination of service
pursuant to the award agreement between the Company and the Securityholder
under which the Stock Option was granted or an applicable employment or other
service agreement between the Company and such Securityholder, in any case, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement. Such conversion and assumption of the
converted Stock Options is intended to comply with the regulations and other
binding guidance under Section 409A of the Code; and subject to any changes to
the vesting schedule set forth herein and on Section 2.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, such converted AOL Stock Options shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including expiration date and exercise provisions)
as were applicable to the corresponding Stock Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Employee is terminated
by Parent without Cause within one year of the Closing Date and (i) AOL Stock
Options or (ii) restricted stock units of Parent issued as Additional Payment
Amounts pursuant to Section 6.17 held by such Employee which are unvested at
such time are forfeited and cancelled without any payment in respect thereof
(" _Forfeited Securities_ "), then, on or prior to the one year anniversary of
the Closing, Parent shall deposit the Forfeited Securities Value (as defined
below) with respect to all Forfeited Securities in cash with the Escrow Agent
and such amount shall be added to the Escrow Fund for purposes of distribution
to the other Securityholders in accordance with Section 9.4(c) (and for no
other purpose). For purposes of the foregoing, with respect to any Forfeited
Securities, the " _Forfeited Securities Value_ " means (x) with respect to AOL
Stock Options, the cash Option Consideration that would have been payable in
respect of such Forfeited Securities as of the Effective Time if the Company
Stock Options which were converted into such Forfeited Securities had instead
been converted into Option Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.9(a) and (y) with respect to restricted stock units of Parent, the RSU Value
(determined in accordance with Section 6.17 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) of such Forfeited Securities.

 



17 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall take all actions within
the Companys control that are necessary and will use its reasonable best
efforts to take such other actions as are necessary (including obtaining any
necessary Stock Option holder consents, to the extent it has not already done
so, obtaining Stockholder consent with respect to all of the shares
authorized for issuance under the Company Stock Option Plan on the date
hereof, and passing any necessary resolutions of its board of directors, in
each case, if any) to give effect to the actions contemplated by this Section
2.9 and Sections 2.13 and 2.18 and (ii) Parent shall take all actions
necessary (including passing any necessary resolutions of its board of
directors) to (A) assume, as of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Option
Plan and all awards thereunder in respect of the Stock Options that will be
converted into AOL Stock Options at the Effective Time, and (B) file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or, including if
Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms) that is effective as of
the Effective Time with respect to the shares of Parent common stock subject
to the AOL Stock Options and maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such AOL Stock
Options remain outstanding.

(c) To the extent any deductions attributable to payments to the holders of
Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.9 or Additional Payment Amounts may
be allocable to the Closing Date, they shall be treated for United States
federal income tax purposes (and any similar provisions under state, local or
foreign Laws) as occurring on the day after the Closing Date pursuant to the
"next day rule" of Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) of the U.S. Treasury
Regulations.

2.10 _Payments Certificate_.

 

(a) No later than five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a certificate, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, executed by the Companys Chief Financial Officer (the
" _Payments Certificate_ ") setting forth the Companys estimate as of the
Closing of:

 

(i) the Calculation Amount, specifying separately all components thereof
(including Indebtedness, Aggregate Exercise Price, Company Transaction
Expenses, the Additional Payment Amount and the Estimated Working Capital);

(ii) the Series A-1 Preferred Liquidation Amount;

(iii) the amount of each Stockholder Loan (including principal and interest,
and the aggregate amount necessary to fully discharge each such Stockholder
Loan as of the Effective Time) and the name of the Stockholder party thereto;

 

(iv) the Fully Diluted Number; and

 

(v) the following information relating to each Securityholder: (A) name,
address (as listed in the corporate record books of the Company) and social
security numbers or tax identification numbers (if known by the Company); (B)
the number and class or series of shares of Company Capital Stock held by, or
subject to the Stock Options held by, such Person and the respective
certificate numbers (if applicable);

 



18  (C) the Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration and/or Option
Consideration payable to such Person, with a separate indication of all
components thereof (including the Series A-1 Preferred Liquidation Amount and
the Per Share Amounts); (D) the portion thereof to be deposited into the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 2.13 and the Sharing Percentage of each
Securityholder with respect thereto; (E) the portion thereof to be deposited
into the Securityholders Agent Reserve in accordance with Section 2.18 and
the Sharing Percentage of each Securityholder with respect thereto; (F) with
respect to each holder of Stock Options, the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Stock Options and the exercise price per share of such Stock
Options, (G) with respect to each holder of Warrants, the number, class and
series of Company Capital Stock subject to such Warrants and the exercise
price per share of such Warrants, and (H) with respect to each Employee holder
of Stock Options, the number of Stock Options held by such Employee that will
be converted into AOL Stock Options, the number of AOL Stock Options into
which such Stock Options will be converted, and the exercise price for such
AOL Stock Options after giving effect to such conversion.

(b) Each of the Company and the Securityholders Agent understands that Parent
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on such certificate for the
purposes of making any payments hereunder. 

2.11 _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate representing any shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue after the Effective Time to represent
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.12 _Payment Mechanics_.

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company to act as the Paying Agent in the Merger.

(b) _Deposit With Paying Agent_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall remit to
the Paying Agent cash in an amount necessary to pay to all Securityholders
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares) the applicable Merger Consideration,
Warrant Consideration and Option Consideration to which they are
entitled hereunder, less any amounts to be deposited into (i) the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 2.13 and (ii) the Securityholders Agent Reserve pursuant
to Section 2.18.

 

(c) _Mailing of Letters of Transmittal; Exchange_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available to the Company and, promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed or
delivered, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") that represented as of the Effective Time outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock or Warrants and to each holder of Stock
Options to be exchanged pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.9, as applicable, a
letter of transmittal which shall 

 



19  specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates (if applicable) shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (if applicable) to the Paying Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
and which are reasonably acceptable to the Company, including an appropriate
release of claims, an agreement to be bound by the escrow, indemnity and
remedy provisions of this Agreement and the appointment and powers of the
Securityholders Agent, including the provisions of Sections 2.12(f), 2.13,
2.18, 2.19 and ARTICLES II, IX and X) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (if applicable) in exchange for payment of
the applicable Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration or Option
Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate (if applicable) or
affidavit of loss (if applicable) to the Paying Agent, together with delivery
of such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such letter of transmittal, the holder of such
Certificate (if applicable) or Stock Options shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor payment as soon as reasonably practicable of the applicable
Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration, Option Consideration or AOL
Stock Options that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.6 or 2.9 (but, in each case, subject to Sections 2.13, 2.18 and 2.19), after
giving effect to any applicable withholding Taxes, and the Certificate (if
applicable) or Warrants or Stock Options so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon cash-out by any employee of the
Company of Stock Options to be exchanged for cash pursuant to Section
2.9, following delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such letter of transmittal, the
holder of such Stock Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
payment of the applicable Option Consideration that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.9 (but, in each case, subject to Section
2.13, 2.18 and 2.19), after giving effect to any applicable withholding
Taxes, on the next reasonably practicable payroll payment date (but in no
event more than twenty-one (21) days after the delivery of a valid and
complete letter of transmittal), and the Stock Option so cashed-out shall be
forthwith cancelled.

(d) _Non-Registered Holders_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration,
Warrant Consideration or Option Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate (if applicable) for the related
shares of Company Capital Stock or the Person in whose name the Stock
Option surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, then it will be a
condition to such payment that (i) the Certificate (if applicable) so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange will have paid any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than the registered holder or will have established to the satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

(e) _Unclaimed Amounts_. At any time following six (6) months after the
Effective Time, all cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section
2.12(b) that remains undistributed to the Securityholders shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and thereafter the affected Securityholders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof and
subject to this ARTICLE II. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Securityholders Agent shall be liable to any
Securityholder for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



20 (f) _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent and the Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent shall
reasonably determine in good faith that they are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Laws relating to Taxes. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority and will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

2.13 _Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article II, at the
Effective Time and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
Article IX, Section 2.19 and the Escrow Agreement, Parent shall pay to the
Escrow Agent, for deposit into an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") on
behalf of each Securityholder, an aggregate amount in cash equal to
$23,625,000 (the " _Initial Escrow Amount_ " and, as such amount may be
increased from time to time by the amount of any interest and other income on
such amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ "), which amount shall be deemed to reduce
the Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration and Option Consideration
otherwise payable to a Securityholder at Closing under this Article II by the
amount of the Escrow Fund deemed contributed by such Securityholder (as
calculated pursuant to Section 2.13(b)) and which shall be held by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with Article IX and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and shall be available to
compensate the Indemnified Persons as provided in Article IX and to provide
for a post-closing working capital adjustment pursuant to Section 2.19. To
the extent not used for such purposes, such funds shall be released as
provided in Article IX hereof. Each Securityholder shall be deemed to have
contributed an amount to the Escrow Fund equal to the following: (i) in
the case of a Series C Securityholder, an amount per share of Series C
Preferred Stock held by such holder equal to the Series C Per Share Amount
minus $19.325 (the " _Series C Per Share Escrow Fund Amount_ ") and (ii) in
the case of an Other Securityholder, an amount equal to the Other
Securityholders Escrow Amount multiplied by such Other Securityholders
Initial Sharing Percentage.

2.14 _Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration, Warrant
Consideration and Option Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this ARTICLE II (including amounts paid into the Escrow Fund or the
Securityholders Agent Reserve pursuant to this ARTICLE II) shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Capital Stock (including any rights to receive accumulated but undeclared
dividends on such Company Capital Stock), the Warrants and the Stock Options.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of

 



21  the Surviving Corporation, and from and after the Effective Time, the
Securityholders shall cease to have any rights (including any rights to
receive accumulated but undeclared dividends on any Company Capital Stock)
with respect thereto except as otherwise provided for herein. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE
II.

2.15 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
representing Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Paying Agent shall pay the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates only upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and the delivery of such other
documents reasonably requested by the Paying Agent and Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ __, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates to agree to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to a customary affidavit of loss (or, if the lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates represent more than 1% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock on an as-converted/exercised basis, deliver a bond in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.16 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the
provisions of Section 8.1, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date (the "
_Closing Date_ ") no later than the second Business Day after all the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII shall have been satisfied (or waived in
accordance with Section 11.2), unless another time and/or date is agreed to
by Parent and the Company. The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York
10017, or such other place as Parent and the Company otherwise agree.

2.17 _Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_. At Closing, Parent shall pay,
or instruct the Paying Agent to pay, the Company Transaction Expenses that are
unpaid as of the Closing Date in accordance with the Payoff Instructions, to
the extent deducted from the Calculation Amount as set forth in the
Payments Certificate.

2.18 _Securityholders  Agent Reserve_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE II, at the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause to be, deposited, in an account
designated by the Securityholders Agent at least three (3) Business Days
prior to Closing, the Securityholders Agent Reserve, which amount shall be
deemed to reduce the Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration and Option
Consideration otherwise payable at Closing under this ARTICLE II and which
shall be held by the Securityholders Agent as agent and for the benefit of
the Securityholders in a segregated client bank account in accordance with
this Section 2.18 and ARTICLE X. The Securityholders Agent will hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
Securityholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the
Securityholders Agent

 



22  Reserve and the Securityholders irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Securityholders Agent any ownership right that they may have in any interest
that may accrue on funds held in the Securityholders Agent Reserve. The
Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders Agent is not providing
any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The Securityholders
Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of
the Securityholders Agent Reserve other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. To the extent the amount in the
Securityholders Agent Reserve is insufficient at any time to pay any amount
payable by the Securityholders hereunder, each Securityholder agrees to
advance its Sharing Percentage of such amount to the Securityholders Agent in
order to pay such amount on behalf of the Securityholders. In no event
shall Parent be liable for, or the Escrow Fund be used for, any payment
obligations of the Securityholders hereunder.

(b) The Securityholders Agent Reserve may be applied as the Securityholders
Agent, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate to defray, offset, or
pay any charges, fees, costs, liabilities or expenses of the Securityholders
Agent incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Agreements.

(c) The balance of the Securityholders Agent Reserve held pursuant to this
Section 2.18, if any, shall be distributed to the Securityholders by the
Securityholders Agent. Each Securityholder shall be deemed to have
contributed an amount to the Securityholders Agent Reserve equal to its
respective Sharing Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Securityholders Agent Reserve shall only be so distributed when the
Securityholders Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that such
distribution is appropriate. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates shall have any liability
or responsibility to the Securityholders with respect to the Securityholders
Agent Reserve or the actions and responsibilities of the Securityholders
Agent contemplated by this Section 2.18, and the Securityholders shall seek
distribution of the Securityholders Agent Reserve solely from the
Securityholders Agent.

2.19 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare a good faith
calculation, with reasonable supporting detail as to such calculation, of the
Working Capital of the Company and its Subsidiary as of the Closing and
deliver such calculation to Securityholders Agent no later than the ninetieth
(90th) calendar day following the Closing Date. The calculation of the
Working Capital delivered to the Securityholders Agent shall be final and
binding on all parties unless the Securityholders Agent gives Parent written
notice of its objections (an " _Objection Notice_ "), with reasonable
supporting detail as to such objections, within thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt of the calculation prepared by Parent. In the event the
Securityholders Agent fails to give Parent an Objection Notice or
otherwise notifies Parent earlier in writing that the Securityholders Agent
has no objections to such calculation of the Working Capital, the parties
shall take such steps as are necessary to make distributions in accordance
with Section 2.19(d). Any component of the calculation of Working Capital
that is not the subject of an Objection Notice by the Securityholders Agent
shall be final and binding on all parties except to the extent such component
is affected by other components of the calculation of Working Capital that
are the subject of an Objection Notice. Throughout the period following the
Closing Date, the Securityholders Agent shall have the right to review such 

 



23  calculation of the Working Capital, and each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees to reasonably cooperate in any such process as requested by
the Securityholders Agent and to provide such access to the Surviving
Corporations books and records as the Securityholders Agent shall reasonably
request. In the event the Securityholders Agent gives Parent an Objection
Notice, then, within five (5) Business Days after such Objection Notice has
been given to Parent, the parties shall take such steps as are necessary to
make either of the distributions under Section 2.19(d)(i) or (ii), in each
case to the extent applicable in light of the extent to which the
Securityholders Agent has not objected to the calculation of Working Capital.

(b) Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall use reasonable efforts to
resolve any dispute arising under Section 2.19(a); _provided_ , that if they
are unable to do so within thirty (30) calendar days following the
Securityholders Agent giving Parent an Objection Notice, then by notice from
either party to the other, the disagreement shall be submitted for resolution
to a nationally-recognized independent public accounting firm reasonably
satisfactory to the Securityholders Agent and Parent (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "); provided that the Independent Accountant shall not be the
accounting firm used by Parent to audit its financial statements unless
Securityholders Agent otherwise agrees. If a dispute is submitted to the
Independent Accountant for resolution, Parent and the Securityholders Agent
shall enter into a customary engagement letter with the Independent Accountant
at the time such dispute is submitted to the Independent Accountant and shall
cooperate with the Independent Accountant in connection with its determination
pursuant to this Section 2.19. Within thirty (30) Business Days after the
Independent Accountant has been retained, each party shall furnish, at its
own expense (or, with respect to the Securityholders Agent, at the expense of
the Securityholders), to the Independent Accountant and the other party a
written statement of its positions with respect to each matter in dispute.
Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of such thirty (30)
Business Day period, each party shall deliver to the Independent Accountant
and to each other its response to the others position on each matter
in dispute. With each submission, each party may also furnish to the
Independent Accountant such other information and documents as it deems
relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by the
Independent Accountant with copies being given to the other party
substantially simultaneously. The Independent Accountant may, at its
discretion, conduct a conference concerning the disagreement and each party
shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and
other information and to have present its Representatives.

(c) The Independent Accountant shall be directed to promptly, and in
any event within thirty (30) calendar days after its appointment pursuant to
Section 2.19(b), render its decision on the disputed items applying GAAP
principles and the methodologies set forth in this Agreement (but taking into
account the deviations from GAAP specified in the components of Working
Capital). The Independent Accountants determination as to each item in
dispute shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to each party,
which shall include the Independent Accountants determination as to the
calculation of the Working Capital, all of which shall be final and binding on
all parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
shared equally by Parent and the Securityholders. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Independent Accountants fees and expenses payable by the Securityholders,
if any, shall not be paid from the funds in the Escrow Fund. The
Securityholders Agent shall pay the Securityholders portion of such fees and
expenses on their behalf from the Securityholders Agent Reserve and, to the
extent amounts therein shall not be sufficient to pay such fees and expenses,
the Securityholders Agent shall collect such funds from the Securityholders.

 



24 (d) If the amount of the Working Capital as deemed final and binding pursuant
to this Section 2.19:

(i) exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, then within five (5) Business Days
after such final determination Parent shall promptly deposit, in immediately
available funds, with the Paying Agent an amount in cash equal to such excess
of the Working Capital over the Estimated Working Capital, and shall provide a
written instruction to the Paying Agent to deliver promptly to each of the
Securityholders, such Securityholders Sharing Percentage of such deposited
amount.

(ii) is less than the Estimated Working Capital, then within five (5) Business
Days after such final determination, the parties shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow Fund by
wire transfer in accordance with the Escrow Agreement the amount of the
difference of the Estimated Working Capital over the Working Capital to

3.4 _Authority; Enforceability_. The Company has all necessary corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, each Related Agreement
to which it is a party and each instrument required to be executed and
delivered by it on or prior at the Closing and to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, each Related Agreement and each instrument required to be executed
and delivered by it on or prior to the Closing, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly approved by the
Companys board of directors and have been duly and validly authorized by all
corporate or similar action, and no other corporate or similar proceedings on
the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement, any Related
Agreement to which the Company is a party or any instrument required to be
executed and delivered by the Company on or prior to the Closing or the
consummation of transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than the
Stockholder Approval. Each of this Agreement, the Related Agreements to which
the Company is party and each instrument required to be executed and
delivered by the Company on or prior to the Closing has been duly and validly
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery thereof by all other parties thereto, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

3.5 _Required Vote_. The board of directors of the Company has, at a meeting
duly called and held prior to the execution of each of this Agreement and
each Related Agreement to which the Company is a party, (a) unanimously
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and each Related Agreement to
which the Company is a party, (b) determined that the transactions

single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (ii) holders of 66
2/3 of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis are the only votes,
approvals or other corporate actions of the holders of Company Capital Stock
or of any other security of the Company necessary for the Company to approve,
authorize and adopt this Agreement, the Merger, the Related Agreements to
which the Company is a party and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and to confirm the allocation of consideration to be paid
in the Merger or allocated to holders of Stock Options or

_Stockholder Approval_ "). After receipt of the Stockholder Approval, which is
expected to occur promptly 

 



28  after the execution of this Agreement, the Merger and this Agreement will be
duly and validly adopted and approved by the holders of the Company Capital
Stock, and no further vote, approval or other action on the part of any

Agreements to which the Company is a party and the other transactions

consideration to be paid in the Merger or allocated to holders of Stock
Options or Warrants. The agreements to vote and proxies given in the Consent

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

6.1 _Information Statement_. 

Promptly after the execution hereof, the Company shall prepare and circulate
to Stockholders an information statement (the " _Information Statement_ ") in
connection with the Companys solicitation of the adoption and approval by
written consent of this Agreement and the Merger by the Stockholders, and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit their consent thereto
and to cause them to deliver their executed counterpart to the Consent
Agreement, in each case as soon as practicable after the date hereof. The
Information Statement shall include the required notice under Delaware Law
that the holders of Company Capital Stock are or may be entitled to assert
dissenters rights under such Law in connection with the Merger. The Company
will promptly advise Parent if at any time prior to the Effective Time
the Company shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary
to amend or supplement the Information Statement in order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading or to comply with applicable Law.
The Information Statement shall contain the unanimous recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company that the holders of Company Capital Stock
approve the Merger and shall, in accordance with the requirements of Section
228(e) of the DGCL, notify any holder of Company Capital Stock who did not
execute the Stockholder Approval of the corporate action taken by those
Stockholders who did execute the Stockholder Approval, and all such other
information as Parent shall reasonably request. Any materials to be submitted
to the Stockholders by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to Parents advance review
and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld).

 

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of (x) the Closing Date
or (y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours, the Company shall afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and agents of Parent
(collectively " _Parent Representatives_ ") reasonable access to all its
properties, records, databases, books, Contracts, commitments and other
information (however stored) and furnish promptly to Parent all such
information as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall make
available to Parent the appropriate individuals for discussion of its
business, properties and personnel as Parent or the Parent Representatives may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.2(a) shall affect any remedy available to Parent for any
breach by the Company of its representations, warranties and agreements
contained herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall provide
all financial information concerning the Company as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, including (i) as soon as practicable (but no later than

quarter and (ii) as soon as practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) days

statements of the Company for such calendar month. In addition, the Company
shall provide all information reasonably requested by Parent relating to net
operating loss and credit carryovers of the Company and its Subsidiary,

 



53  including information necessary for Parent to determine the amounts of such
net operating loss and credit carryovers and limitations, if any, on the use
of such net operating loss and credit carryovers under applicable Law. For
the avoidance of doubt, any study regarding such net operating loss and credit
carryovers, or limitations on the use thereof, shall be conducted by Parent
solely at its own expense. Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 6.2, if
the Company reasonably and in good faith determines that the provision of such
access or information would violate applicable Law or an obligation of
confidentiality under a Contract with a third-party or jeopardize
the protection of the attorney-client privilege, then the Company (A) may
limit such access or information only to the extent the provision of such
access or information is restricted and (B) shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent to eliminate or limit such restriction and allow such access or
information to the maximum extent possible, including by providing such access
or information to Parents attorneys, accountants, consultants or other
advisors, providing a summary of such information and/or making such
information available in a "clean room" or similar place where access is
restricted to Persons permitted to view such information.

(b) Parent shall keep all information obtained pursuant to Section 6.2(a)
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of January 14, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), between Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement,
Parent and the Company may issue press release(s) or make other public
announcements in accordance with Section 6.6.

(c) Each of the Company and the Securityholders Agent hereby agrees that,
except as required by law, it will hold, and will cause its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and advisors
(including attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial advisors
and, with respect to the Securityholders Agent, the Securityholders) to
hold, as confidential any information regarding Parent, Merger Sub, the
existence of this Agreement, any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, Parent and the
Company may issue press release(s) or make other public announcements in
accordance with Section 6.6.

to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and

more of its Subsidiaries to) provide any Continuing Employees with service

the Continuing Employees become eligible to participate (together " _Post-
Closing Plans_ ") for such Continuing Employees service with the Company for
purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, in the case of Parents
vacation and severance plans or programs, benefit accrual (except to the
extent such service credit or benefit accruals would result in a duplication
of benefits). With respect to any Post-Closing Plans that are health or
welfare benefit plans, Parent shall (or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to) (i) give effect, in determining any deductible

 



57  limitations and co-payments, to any amounts paid by such Continuing

limited to, the Client Services Agreement, dated December 7, 2007 between the
Company and ADP Total Source, Inc. (in each case as specified by Parent),
(ii) causing benefit accrual or entitlement under any Employee Plan (excluding
any Employee Plans that are agreements entered into between the Company and
any service provider) to cease as of the Closing Date, and (iii) causing the
continuation through the Closing Date of any insurance policy or arrangement
relating to any Employee Plan, to the extent available on substantially the
same terms and conditions at substantially the same cost to the Company. 

(f) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing
Date, the Company shall terminate TheHuffingtonPost.com 401(k) Plan (the "

to effectuate the foregoing. Parent shall cause the AOL Savings Plan (the "
_Parent s 401(k) Plan_") to, following the Closing Date, accept rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code but excluding the amount of any unpaid balance
of any loan made under the Company 401(k) Plan) in an amount equal to the full
account balance distributed to each employee of the Company who was a
participant in the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.7, express or implied, shall (i) be
construed to restrict in any way the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (A) amend, terminate or modify the
duties, responsibilities or employment of any

 



58  Employee, (B) to amend, terminate or modify any Employee Plan, compensation
or benefit arrangement or any other employee benefit plans or programs
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates at any
time or from time to time or (C) grant any Employee any special right for
compensation, (ii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
compensation or benefit arrangement of Parent, the Company, or any of its
Affiliates, including any Employee Plan, or (iii) be construed to create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any present or former employee, service
provider, independent contractor, consultant, any such Persons alternate

continued service or resumed service, compensation, benefits or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall limit any

reasonably acceptable to Parent, the Company and the Securityholders Agent
(the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to execute and deliver, the Escrow Agreement
contemplated by ARTICLE IX and Section 2.19 (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The
Escrow Agreement shall contain customary provisions and shall be consistent

information necessary for Parent to effect the final payment in full thereof)
and indicating that upon receipt of such amounts that all such Company
Transaction Expenses shall have been paid in full (the " _Payoff Instructions_
").

 



59 (b) In the event the Company Transaction Expenses unpaid at Closing exceed the
amount set forth in the Payoff Instructions (the amount of such excess, the "

proceeding or any demand or claim on the Company or its Subsidiary with
respect to Taxes (any such notice is referred to herein as a " _Tax Notice_
") that, if determined adversely to the Company or its Subsidiary after the
lapse of time, would be grounds for indemnification under Section 9.2(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided in Section 9.2(a) other than to the extent that the
indemnifying Securityholders have been actually and materially prejudiced as a

preceding period) _multiplied by_ (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date

measured by income, receipts or occupancy or imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (whether real or personal,
tangible or intangible)), to be the amount of any such Taxes that would
be payable if the taxable year ended as of the close of business on the

to file income Tax Returns by closing the books as of the Closing Date, the
parties agree to make such election.

coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such premium
as does not exceed the Insurance Cap. Parent shall cause the Surviving

(treating such time as if it were the Closing for purposes of this Section
8.1(d)) or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of the Company of any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any Related
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) would not be

within thirty (30) days after notice thereof by Parent to the Company;

 

(e) by the Company, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under

_Fundamental Representations_ " and in clauses (a) and (b), the " _Carve Out
Representations_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an
indemnification claim in respect of a Loss from a particular Covered Matter

Covered Matter shall survive as to such indemnification claim until such claim
has been finally resolved. 

9.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX, from and after
the Effective Time, each Securityholder shall, severally indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and their respective officers,
directors, agents, representatives, employees, successors and permitted
assigns (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all amounts,
payments, losses, damages, claims, demands, actions or causes of action,
liabilities settlements, judgments, costs, fees and expenses (including
interest, penalties, advisor and attorneys fees and expenses and costs
of Claims) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by them arising out of,
resulting from or relating to any of the following matters (each, a " _Covered
Matter_ "):

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant
hereto, in each case determined without regard to any materiality (including
the words "material" or "Material Adverse Effect") or similar qualifiers or
exceptions contained therein;

 

(ii) (A) the breach by the Company of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement if such breach occurs prior to the Effective Time, or (B) the
breach by the Securityholders Agent of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement;

(iii) the amount of all Company Transaction Expenses and Indebtedness that
have not been paid at or prior to Closing and that are not reflected in the
Calculation Amount or taken into account in the final calculation of Working
Capital;

(iv) the amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) any amounts that Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation is required by a court of
competent jurisdiction to pay, or pays in settlement, in respect of any
Dissenting Shares _over_ (B) the amount of the Merger Consideration into
which such Dissenting Shares would have been converted in the Merger had such
shares not been Dissenting Shares, and all other Losses relating to such
Dissenting Shares and any related Claim;

 

(v) any Claim or allegation that after the Effective Time any share of Company
Capital Stock or any Stock Option or Warrant entitles the holder thereof to
anything other than the amount in cash (if any) and the AOL Stock Options (if
any) that such Person is entitled to receive in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in the Payments Certificate;

 



68 (vi) (A) any and all liability for Taxes with respect to any taxable
period of the Company (or any predecessors) or its Subsidiary for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for any Straddle Period to
the extent allocable (as provided in Section 6.13(f)), to the portion of such
period ending on the Closing Date; (B) any and all liability of the
Indemnified Persons (as a result of Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or
otherwise) for Taxes with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date of any Person (other than the Company,
its Subsidiary or the Securityholders) (I) with whom the Company joins or has
ever joined (or is or has ever been required to join) in filing any
consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate Tax Return prior to the Closing
Date or (II) imposed on the Company or its Subsidiary, as a transferee or
successor, by Contract or otherwise; and (C) any payments required to be made
after the Closing Date under any Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or Tax
sharing agreement or similar Contract or arrangement to which the Company or
its Subsidiary was obligated, bound by or was a party on or prior to the
Closing Date; and

(vii) any of the matters set forth on Section 9.2(a)(vii) of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule.

The amounts available in the Escrow Fund shall be security for the foregoing
indemnity obligations, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
For purposes of clarifying the meaning of "several" indemnification by the
Securityholders under this Section 9.2(a) (y) any amounts recovered by
Indemnified Persons from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be
deemed to have been "severally" recovered from all of the Securityholders (it
being understood that if the Indemnified Parties are entitled to receive a
distribution of a portion of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, no individual Securityholder shall have
the right to assert or otherwise contest that such Securityholders allocable
portion of such distribution should remain in the Escrow Fund or otherwise not
be so distributed), and (z) with respect to Claims for indemnification under
this Section 9.2(a) that would not be paid out of the Escrow Fund, (i) if any
indemnification payment is owed, each Securityholders indemnification
obligation pursuant to this ARTICLE IX (subject to the limitations set forth
in ARTICLE IX) shall be limited to such Securityholders Sharing Percentage of
the applicable Losses with respect to which the indemnification payment is
made and (ii) such claim shall be subject to Section 10.1. 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledge that any Losses incurred by the
Indemnified Persons arising out of, resulting from or relating to any of the
matters set forth in Section 9.2(a) would relate to unresolved contingencies
existing at the Effective Time that, if they had been resolved at the
Effective Time, would have led to a reduction in the total amount of the
Merger Consideration that Parent would have agreed to pay in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

9.3 _Calculation of Losses; Limitations_.

(a) For the purposes of calculating Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i), the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement, in the
Related Agreements or in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant
hereto shall be deemed to exclude any materiality (including the words
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect") or similar qualifiers or exceptions
contained therein.

 



69 (b) Except in respect of the Fundamental Representations or in the case of an
intentional breach of covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(a)(ii) (A) for any item, or group of items
arising out of the same or similar series of events or circumstances, unless
the Loss relating thereto exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "); and
(B) for any Losses until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the
Indemnified Persons exceeds $2,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), disregarding
any claim that does not exceed the Per Claim Threshold and then only to the
extent the Losses exceed the Deductible.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in Section 9.3(b) shall not
apply to any claims for indemnification made by the Indemnified Persons under
Sections 9.2(a)(ii) (with respect to intentional breaches of covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement), 9.2(a)(iii), 9.2(a)(iv), 9.2(a)(v),
9.2(a)(vi) and 9.2(a)(vii).

 

(d) From and after the Closing, the amounts contained in the Escrow Fund
(excluding amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.9(a))
shall be the sole recourse by and exclusive remedy for the Indemnified Persons
against the Securityholders for satisfaction of the Securityholders
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) due to a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE III of this Agreement,
and pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(ii) (other than in respect of intentional
breaches) and 9.2(a)(vi), except (i) in the case of fraud by a Securityholder
or fraud by the Company involving a Securityholder, in either case, with
respect to a claim against such Securityholder, (ii) with respect to Losses
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any breach or alleged breach of
any Fundamental Representation and (iii) as provided in the following
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event all or any portion of
the Escrow Fund is released to the Securityholders (the amount released to a
Securityholder, such Securityholders " _Released Escrow Fund Amount_ "), the
Indemnified Persons shall have the right to recover from a Securityholder with
respect to Losses indemnified under Sections 9.2(a)(ii) (other than in respect
of intentional breaches of covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which shall not be limited by this Section 9.3(d)), 9.2(a)(vi) and
Losses resulting from a breach of the representations and warranties of
Section 3.16 in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (i) such
Securityholders Sharing Percentage of the Losses resulting from such
indemnification or breach and (ii) such Securityholders Released Escrow Fund
Amount (less any portion of such Released Escrow Fund Amount previously paid
to satisfy any claim for breaches of any Fundamental Representations). In
addition, in no event shall any Securityholders aggregate liability pursuant
to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of Fundamental Representations exceed (i)
50% of the total consideration payable to such Securityholder pursuant to
ARTICLE II of this Agreement (inclusive of such Securityholders Sharing
Percentage of the Escrow Fund) less (ii) any amount from the Escrow Fund (or
any Released Escrow Fund Amount) allocable to such Selling Securityholder
previously used to satisfy any indemnification claims hereunder.

(e) The indemnifying Securityholders shall not be liable to, or required to
indemnify, the Indemnified Persons for any Losses that are punitive (except to
the extent constituting third party punitive claims). The Indemnified Persons
shall not use "multiple of profits," "multiple of revenue" or "multiple of
cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating the amount of
any Losses.

 



70 (f) The Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Indemnified Persons have already recovered the same Losses
with respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement or
such Losses were taken into account in determining the amount of
Indebtedness, Additional Payment Amount and Working Capital.

(g) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Section
9.3 shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts under
indemnification agreements actually received by the Indemnified Persons on
account of such Loss.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) for any Losses resulting from, or relating or attributable to,
(i) any Taxes (A) attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period, (B) attributable
to actions out of the ordinary course of business taken, or caused to be
taken, by Parent after Closing on the Closing Date other than actions
contemplated by this Agreement or (C) which are Transfer Taxes for which
Parent is responsible pursuant to Section 6.13(d), or (ii) any reduction of
or limitation on use with respect to a net operating loss carryover or credit
carryover of the Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to
the extent such reduction or limitation results in a Tax liability for which
any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

9.4 _Escrow Fund; Escrow Period_.

 

(a) On or before the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount shall be deposited in
the Escrow Fund with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or an Affiliate thereof) or
another institution mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company, which
Person shall serve as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") in connection with
this Agreement, with the Escrow Fund to be governed by the terms set forth
herein and in the Escrow Agreement. The parties agree to treat the Escrow Fund
as owned by Parent and not received by the Securityholders to the extent not
paid to the Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement, and to file all Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with such treatment.

(b) Upon the termination of the Survival Period and unless otherwise agreed
in writing between Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, the Escrow
Agent shall deliver any remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund (less (i) amounts
that would be necessary to satisfy any then pending and unsatisfied or
unresolved claims specified in any Escrow Claim Notice delivered to the
Escrow Agent prior to the termination of the Survival Period if such claims
were resolved in full in favor of the Indemnified Persons and less any
applicable withholding Tax and (ii) any amounts subject to an Objection
Notice pursuant to Section 2.19) to the Securityholders in accordance with
clause (c) below; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount equal
to the Forfeited Securities Value (together with interest thereon) shall be
distributed to the Securityholders upon termination of the Survival Period
irrespective of whether there are any pending Escrow Claims, and such amount
shall not be subject to any right of setoff. Amounts not distributed pursuant
to the foregoing in respect of pending and unsatisfied or unresolved

 



71  claims shall remain in the Escrow Fund until the related claims have been
finally resolved. Promptly following the time that all such pending and
unsatisfied or unresolved claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute the remaining portion of such undistributed amount, if any, not
used to satisfy such claims and less any applicable withholding Taxes in
accordance with clause (c) below.

 

(c) Distributions from the Escrow Fund to the Securityholders shall be made as
follows: (y) first, a distribution in an amount equal to the Other
Securityholders Initial Distribution Amount shall be made to the Other
Securityholders in proportion to the Other Securityholders Initial Sharing
Percentages and (z) after the Other Securityholders Initial Distribution
Amount has been distributed to the Other Securityholders pursuant to clause
(y) above, all remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund that are distributed to
Securityholders shall be distributed to all Selling Securityholders
in proportion to their respective Sharing Percentages.

9.5 _Claims Upon Escrow Fund_. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before
the last day of the Survival Period of a written notice from Parent (an "
_Escrow Claim Notice_ ") stating that an indemnification claim pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) is being made and specifying in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances surrounding the Escrow Claim Notice (to the extent known by
Parent), as well as a good faith estimate of the amount of the Escrow Fund
necessary to cover all applicable Losses in respect of such claim (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Persons shall not be bound by
any estimate of Losses contained in such description and shall not lose any
right to indemnification for failure to provide such reasonable detail), the
Escrow Agent shall, subject to Sections 9.6 and 9.7, deliver to Parent out of
the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, an amount equal to such Losses
from the Escrow Fund. In addition, the Escrow Agent shall distribute funds
from the Escrow Fund as mutually agreed between Parent and, prior to the
Closing, the Company or, after the Closing, the Securityholders Agent.

 

9.6 _Objections to Claims_. Except for Tax Claims, which are governed by
Section 6.13, at the time of delivery of any Escrow Claim Notice to the
Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Escrow Claim Notice shall be delivered
to the Securityholders Agent, and, for a period of thirty (30) days after
such delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Escrow Claim Notice, the Escrow
Agent shall make no payment pursuant to Section 9.5 hereof unless the Escrow
Agent shall have received written authorization from the Securityholders
Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period, without the requirement for any additional written authorization of
the Securityholders Agent, the Escrow Agent shall make payment in accordance
with Section 9.5; _provided_ that no such payment may be made if the
Securityholders Agent shall object in a written statement (describing the
basis for any objection with reasonable specificity) to the claim made in the
Escrow Claim Notice and if such statement shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period.

9.7 _Resolution of Conflicts_. Except for Tax Claims, which are governed by
Section 6.13, if the Securityholders Agent shall object pursuant to Section
9.6 to any claims by Parent made in any Escrow Claim Notice, then the
Securityholders Agent and Parent shall meet and confer and shall attempt in
good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to such claims. If the Securityholders Agent and Parent
should so 

 



72  agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by Parent and the Securityholders Agent and shall be furnished to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and shall pay the amount set forth in such memorandum in accordance
with the terms thereof. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, Parent and the Securityholders Agent may institute proceedings
in a court of competent jurisdiction (in accordance with Section 11.12) to
resolve any such dispute.

 

9.8 _Third-Party Claims_.

(a) Except for Tax Claims, which are governed by Section 6.13, and except as
mutually agreed between Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, in
connection with a third-party claim that Parent believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Fund, (i) after such determination by Parent, Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Securityholders Agent a written notice
describing in reasonable detail such third-party claim (to the extent known
by Parent); provided, however, that the failure or delay on the part of Parent
in notifying the Securityholders Agent shall not release, waive, preclude or
otherwise affect Parents claim for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE
IX, except to the extent that the Securityholders can demonstrate actual loss
and prejudice as a result of such failure or delay; (ii) with respect to
third-party claims involving or seeking any (A) non-monetary remedy or
monetary damages in excess of the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund,
(B) claims for equitable relief or (C) potential criminal liability (all
together " _Parent-Controlled Claims_ "), the Securityholders Agent shall be
entitled, at the Securityholders expense, to consult with Parent in any
defense of such claim, it being understood that Parent shall have the sole
right to control such defense (including the right to settle any such claim);
provided, however, that the parties shall cooperate in good faith to
implement reasonable arrangements designed to preserve any existing attorney-
client privilege; provided further that the Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to withhold information from the Securityholders Agent if its
provision to the Securityholders Agent would cause the attorney-client
privilege thereof to be waived and there is no method of providing such
information to the Securityholders Agent in a manner which would not result
in such a waiver; provided further that if Parent, within a reasonable time
after receipt of notice of any such third-party claim, fails to assume and
conduct the defense of such third-party claim, the Securityholders Agent
shall have the right to undertake the defense of such Third-Party Claim; and
(iii) with respect to all third-party claims which will result in a demand
against the Escrow Fund and which are not Parent-Controlled Claims, the Parent
shall be entitled, at the Parents expense, to consult with the
Securityholders Agent in any defense of such claim, it being understood that
the Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to have and exercise the right to
control the defense of such claim (including the right to settle any such
claim) in cooperation with and taking into account the views of Parent.

 

(b) Except for Tax Claims, which are governed by Section 6.13, and Parent-
Controlled Claims for which the Securityholders would not have liability, to
the extent that Parent has the right to control the defense of a claim or the
Securityholders Agent elected not to solely control the defense of any claim,
an Indemnified Person shall in good faith seek the prior written consent of
the Securityholders Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) prior to entering into a settlement in respect of such
third-party claim, it being understood that such consent shall not constitute
an admission that such third party claim constitutes, in whole or in part, an
indemnifiable Loss for purposes of this ARTICLE IX.

 



73 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Person shall not be prohibited
from entering into a settlement of such third-party claim (the defense of
which is not controlled by Securityholders Agent) without the
Securityholders Agents consent; provided that, in such case, the
Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to contest the amounts owed by the
Securityholders in respect of such third-party claim on the basis that the
settlement by the Indemnified Person was not reasonable in light of the
circumstances of such third-party claim or did not constitute, in whole or
in part, an indemnifiable Loss for purposes of this ARTICLE IX.

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, except in the case of fraud, (i) this ARTICLE IX shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the
Effective Time for any claims arising under this Agreement, including claims
of inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement or any certificates delivered pursuant hereto; and (ii) a breach of
contract claim shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the
Securityholders Agent against Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation for any claims arising under this Agreement, including claims of
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement or any certificates delivered pursuant hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing clause of this sentence shall not be deemed a
waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief.

 

9.10 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The parties hereto agree that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the applicable Merger Consideration or Option
Consideration to which the Securityholders were entitled hereunder, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE X

 

 _THE SECURITYHOLDERS  AGENT _

10.1 _The Securityholders  Agent_.

(a)  _Appointment_. By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the
Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, the Company and the Securityholders shall be deemed to have
approved the designation of, and hereby appoint, Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, as agent and attorney-in-
fact (including any successor appointed pursuant to Section 10.1(i), the "
_Securityholders  Agent_") for and on behalf of the Securityholders. The

matters arising under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and all actions
taken by the Securityholders Agent hereunder and thereunder shall be binding
upon all such Securityholders as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by each of them, and no Securityholders shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Securityholders
Agent shall take any and all actions that it believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of

the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the
Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, the Securityholders hereby authorize the Securityholders Agent,
on the Securityholders behalf, to: (i) receive all notices or documents given

accept service of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding

connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby as the Securityholders Agent may in its sole

deem appropriate in respect of (A) taking such other action as the

under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (B) receiving all documents
or certificates and making all determinations, on behalf of any of the
Securityholders, required under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (C)

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
including, without limitation, the defense and/or settlement of any claims for
which indemnification is sought pursuant to ARTICLE IX and any waiver of any
obligation of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation. All actions,
decisions and instructions of the Securityholders Agent shall be conclusive
and binding upon all of the Securityholders, and no Securityholder shall have
any claim or cause of action against the Securityholders Agent, and the
Securityholders Agent shall have no liability to any Securityholder, for any
action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Securityholders Agent
in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except in the case
of the

 



75  Securityholders Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders Agent may, in all questions arising under this Agreement,
rely on the advice of counsel, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in
good faith by the Securityholders Agent in accordance with such advice, the
Securityholders Agent shall not be liable to the Securityholders or the
Escrow Agent. Each Securityholder hereby agrees to receive correspondence
from the Securityholders Agent, including in electronic form.

(c) _Indemnification of Securityholders  Agent; Compensation_. The
Securityholders Agent shall be indemnified for and shall be held harmless by
the Securityholders (including, but not limited to, through the
Securityholders Agent Reserve) (but not out of the Escrow Fund) against any
loss, liability or expense (each, an " _Agent Loss_ ") incurred by the
Securityholders Agent relating to the Securityholders Agents conduct in its
capacity as Securityholders Agent, in each case as such Agent Loss is
incurred; provided that in the event it is finally adjudicated that an Agent
Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Securityholders Agent, the Securityholders Agent
will reimburse the Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Agent Loss
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
indemnification under this Section 10.1(c) shall survive the termination of
this Agreement. The costs of such indemnification (including the costs and
expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification) shall be the
responsibility of the Securityholders (including, but not limited to, through
the Securityholders Agent Reserve) (but not out of the Escrow Fund) pro rata
based on their respective Sharing Percentage, and Parent shall have no
liability therefor. The Securityholders Agent shall not receive any
compensation for its services hereunder other than pursuant to the terms of
the Securityholders Agent Agreement entered into between Shareholder
Representative Services LLC and certain of the Companys stockholders in
connection with the Merger.

(d) _Access to Information_. Subject to any attorney-client or similar legal
privileges, Parent shall provide the Securityholders Agent reasonable access
(including electronic access, to the extent available), subject to appropriate
confidentiality restrictions, to information relating to any Indemnity Claim
that is in the possession or control of Parent, and Parent shall make
available the reasonable assistance Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporations officers and employees for purposes of performing the
Securityholders Agents duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
including for the purpose of evaluating any Indemnity Claim; _provided_ that
the Securityholders Agent shall treat confidentially and shall not disclose
any nonpublic information from or concerning any Indemnity Claim to any
Person (other than, on a need-to-know basis, to (i) the Securityholders
Agents attorneys, accountants or other advisers, (ii) the Securityholders and
(iii) any arbitrators appointed to resolve disputes pursuant to this
Agreement).

(e) _Reasonable Reliance_. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed by him, her or it to be genuine, accurate as to
content and signed by any Securityholder or Parent. The
Securityholders Agent may assume that any person purporting to give any
notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do
so.

(f) _Attorney-in-Fact_. The Securityholders Agent is hereby appointed and
constituted the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Securityholder, with
full power in his, her 

 



76  or its name and on his, her or its behalf to act according to the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in the absolute discretion of the
Securityholders Agent and in general to do all things and to perform all
acts, including executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments
contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with the Escrow Agreement.
This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall
be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Securityholder,
by operation of law (whether by such Securityholders death,
disability protective supervision) or any other event. Without limitation to
the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the performance of a
special obligation, and, accordingly, each Securityholder hereby renounces
its, his or her right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally before
the complete distribution of the Escrow Fund. Each Securityholder hereby
waives any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate or
disaffirm the action of the Securityholders Agent taken in good faith under
the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this
Section 10.1(f), no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or
document shall be ineffective by reason only of the Securityholders having
signed or given such directly instead of the Securityholders Agent.

(g) _Liability_. If the Securityholders Agent is required by the terms of
this Agreement or of the Escrow Agreement to determine the occurrence of any
event or contingency, the Securityholders Agent shall, in making such
determination, be liable to the Securityholders only for his, her or its
proven gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in light of all
the circumstances, including the time and facilities available to him, her or
it in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. In
determining the occurrence of any such event or contingency, the
Securityholders Agent may request from any of the Securityholders such
reasonable additional evidence as the Securityholders Agent in its sole
discretion may deem necessary to determine any fact relating to the
occurrence of such event or contingency and may at any time inquire of and
consult with others, including any of the Securityholders. The
Securityholders Agent shall not be liable to any Securityholders for any
damages resulting from his, her or its delay in acting hereunder pending his
receipt and examination of additional evidence requested by him.

(h) _Orders_. The Securityholders Agent is authorized, in his sole
discretion, to comply with final, nonappealable orders or decisions issued or
process entered by any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator with
respect to the Escrow Fund. If any portion of the Escrow Fund is disbursed to
the Securityholders Agent and is at any time attached, garnished or levied
upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any
court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered
by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then
the Securityholders Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, but in good
faith, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree
of which he, she or it is advised by legal counsel selected by him, her or it
is binding upon him, her or it without the need for appeal or other action.
If the Securityholders Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree, the Securityholders Agent shall not be liable to any Securityholder
by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree
may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

 



77 (i) _Removal of Securityholders  Agent; Authority of
Successor Securityholders Agent_. If the Securityholders Agent shall die,
become disabled, resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities
hereunder, those Securityholders that in the aggregate hold at least a
majority of the Securityholders Sharing Percentage shall have the right to
appoint a successor Securityholders Agent. Those Securityholders that in the
aggregate hold at least a majority of the Securityholders Sharing Percentages
shall have the right at any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement or
thereafter to remove the then-acting Securityholders Agent and to appoint a
successor Securityholders Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither such
removal of the then acting Securityholders Agent nor such appointment of a
successor Securityholders Agent shall be effective until the delivery to the
Escrow Agent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by each such
Securityholder with respect to such removal and appointment, together with an
acknowledgment signed by the successor Securityholders Agent appointed in
such writing that he or she accepts the responsibility of successor
Securityholders Agent and agrees to perform and be bound by all of the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Securityholders Agent. Each
successor Securityholders Agent shall have all of the power, authority,
rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original
Securityholders Agent, and the term "Securityholders Agent" as used herein
and in the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to include any interim or
successor Securityholders Agent.

 

(j) _Actions of Securityholders  Agent_. Any action taken by the
Securityholders Agent pursuant to the authority granted in this Section 10.1
shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Securityholder
notwithstanding any contrary action of, or direction from, any Securityholder.

 

(k) _Reliance_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent,
the Escrow Agent and their Affiliates shall not be obligated to inquire into
the authority of the Securityholders Agent, and each of them shall be fully
protected in dealing with the Securityholders Agent hereunder.

 

(l) _Binding Appointment_. The provisions of this Agreement, including this
ARTICLE X, shall be binding upon each Securityholder and the executors,
heirs, legal representatives and successors of each Securityholder, and any
references in this Agreement to a Securityholder shall mean and include the
successors to the Securityholders rights hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date as follows:
