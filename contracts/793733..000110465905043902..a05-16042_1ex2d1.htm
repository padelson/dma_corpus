Closing Cash or Closing Intercompany Working Capital, Buyer may, within 30

Capital shall, in each case, not be less than the amount thereof shown in
Buyers calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b) nor more than the
amount thereof shown in Deltas calculation delivered pursuant to Section

thereafter choose a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized accounting

Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Intercompany Working
Capital. In making such calculation, the Independent Firm shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Closing Adjustment Statement as to which Buyer
has disagreed.  The Independent Firm shall deliver to Buyer and Delta, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be final and binding upon Buyer and the Sellers. The cost of
such review and report shall be borne equally by Buyer and Delta.

independent accountants and the Company and ASAH to, cooperate and
participate in the preparation of the Estimated Purchase Price Statement and

Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Intercompany Working Capital and Final
Working Capital, Final Cash and Final Intercompany Working Capital and in the

available as reasonably requested books, records, work papers and personnel,
subject (in the case of access to independent accountants work papers) to
the execution by the party seeking such access of a customary release from
liability and indemnification of such independent accountants.

Section 2.04 _. Adjustment of Purchase Price. _(a) If Final Working Capital
exceeds Closing Working Capital as shown in the Estimated Purchase Price
Statement, Buyer shall pay to ASAH, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 2.04(d), the amount of such excess. If Closing Working
Capital as shown in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement exceeds Final
Working Capital, the Contingent Additional Amount shall be reduced, as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 2.04(e), by the amount of such excess.

  



  

(b) If Final Cash exceeds Closing Cash as shown in the Estimated Purchase
Price Statement, Buyer shall pay to ASAH, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.04(d), the
amount of such excess. If Closing Cash as shown in the Estimated Purchase
Price Statement exceeds Final Cash, the Contingent Additional Amount shall be
reduced, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.04(e), by the amount of such excess.

  



  

(c) If Final Intercompany Working Capital exceeds Closing Intercompany
Working Capital as shown in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement, Buyer
shall pay to ASAH, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and
with interest as provided in Section 2.04(d), the amount of such excess not
to exceed the excess of Base Intercompany Working Capital over the Closing
Intercompany Working Capital. If Closing Intercompany Working Capital
as shown in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement exceeds Final
Intercompany Working Capital, the Contingent Additional Amount shall be
reduced, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.04(e), by the lesser of (i) the excess of
Closing Intercompany Working Capital over Final Intercompany Working Capital
and (ii) the excess of Base Intercompany Working Capital over Final
Intercompany Working Capital.

  



  

(d) Payments due to ASAH from Buyer pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or Section
2.04(b) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within ten days
after Final Working Capital, Final Cash and Final Intercompany Working
Capital, as applicable, have been finally determined pursuant to Section 2.03
above by delivery by Buyer, as the case may be, of a certified or official
bank check payable in immediately available funds to ASAH or by causing such
payments to be credited to such account of ASAH as it may designate. The
amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section shall bear interest
from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the period from
the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the
same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

(e) Reductions in the Contingent Additional Amount pursuant to Section
2.04(a) or Section 2.04(b) shall be made as of the day following the date
that Final Working Capital, Final Cash and Final Intercompany Working
Capital, as applicable, have been finally determined pursuant to Section 2.03
above.  The amount of any reduction in the Contingent Additional Amount
made pursuant to this Section shall bear interest from and including
the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date
to the date of payment. Such interest shall also be reduced from the
Contingent Additional Amount at the same time as the reduction pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.04(b) to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
the Contingent Additional Amount has been released to ASAH pursuant to the
provisions of **Schedule 2.01** and the Escrow Agreement and the Withheld
Amount (as defined in **Schedule 2.01**) is insufficient to satisfy
ASAHs obligations to Buyer under Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.04(b), then
such obligations shall be settled in cash.

Section 6.02 _. Delta Access; Confidentiality. _Buyer will cause the
Company, on and after the Closing Date, to afford promptly to Delta and its
agents reasonable access to its properties, books, records, employees and
auditors to the extent necessary to permit Delta to determine any
matter relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or to any period
ending on or before the Closing Date; provided that, any such access by Delta
be conducted during normal business hours and shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer. In addition, with
respect to each Company employee who holds Delta Equity Compensation, Buyer
will, no less frequently than monthly, cause the Company to provide Delta
with a list of all such Company employees whose employment with the Company
has terminated and indicate whether such termination was due to death,
retirement or permanent disability.  The Sellers shall bear all of the out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, but
excluding reimbursement of Buyer or the Company for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the
foregoing.  Delta will hold, and will use its best efforts to cause its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial
or administrative process or by other requirements of law, all confidential
documents and information concerning the Company provided to it pursuant to
this Section.

Company to use any of the marks or names set forth on **Schedule 6.03**.

Delta upon the termination of employment with the Company of any Company

Buyer and its subsidiaries, except to the extent such agreements would not
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of Buyer, its subsidiaries and the Company taken as a whole and
_provided further_ that, notwithstanding the immediately preceding proviso,
if Buyer or the Company or any of Buyers Affiliates are obligated after
Closing to hold separate the business of the Company from that of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates as a condition to the receipt of the DOT Exemption,
then Buyer or the Company or Buyers Affiliates, as applicable, shall agree
to hold separate such businesses to the extent necessary to obtain the DOT
Exemption.  Delta and Buyer shall, and the Sellers shall cause the Company
prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall cause the Company after the Closing, to
execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other
writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in
order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Delta shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and an appropriate filing in respect of the DOT
Exemption, in each case with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten Business Days
following the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or the applicable regulations of the DOT, as the case
may be.

  



  

Section 7.02 _. Certain Filings. _The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with
one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from any Person,
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) in

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

  



  

Section 7.03 _. Public Announcements. _The parties agree to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and,
except for any press releases and public announcements the making of which

national securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make

efforts to ensure that any Delta collateral pledged in support of the
Companys workers compensation liabilities and surety bonds is released to
Delta effective as of the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 8 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 8.01 _. Section 338(h)(10) Election. _(a) Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 8.01(a), Buyer and the Sellers agree to
make a timely, effective and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code and under any comparable statutes in any other jurisdiction
with respect to the Company (the " **Section 338(h)(10) Election**"), and
to file such election in accordance with applicable regulations. The Sellers
and Buyer will report the transfers under this Agreement consistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election under any substantially similar state or local
law, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by
a contrary "determination" (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or similar
provision of state and local laws). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers
obligation to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election is contingent upon Sellers
first paying to Buyer an amount equal to any additional

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

state and local income taxes to be incurred by the Company as a result of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, with the amount of any such payment to be
determined in the same manner as a tax indemnity payment to Buyer under
Section 8.05 below.  Buyer shall have no obligation to file IRS Form 8023
with respect to the purchase transaction hereunder or otherwise make the
Section 338(h)(10) Election unless Sellers make the foregoing payment to
Buyer with respect to State and local income taxes within 240 days after the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare at its own
expense and deliver to Delta a report (the " **Allocation Report** ")
allocating the "ADSP" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338-4) of the assets of the Company in accordance with the Treasury
regulations promulgated under Section 338(h)(10).  The Allocation Report
shall be provided to Delta not later than 90 days after Closing. Delta shall
have 30 days after receipt to review and comment upon the Allocation Report.
Any disagreements between the parties regarding the computations set forth in
the Allocation Report shall be promptly resolved by the Independent Firm.
Once finalized hereunder, Buyer and Delta agree, and will cause the Company,
to act in accordance with the Allocation Report in the preparation, filing
and audit of any Tax Return, unless otherwise required by a contrary final
"determination" as defined in Code Section 1313 or similar provision of state
and local laws.

  



  

Section 8.02 _. Returns Due after Closing and Refunds. _(a) The
Sellers shall include the Company in the Sellers Combined Tax Returns filed
for the period that includes the Closing Date, which returns shall properly
include and reflect the taxable income of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period that ends on the Closing Date (including any deferred items triggered
into income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13, any excess loss account
taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19 and any taxable
income resulting from a Section 338(h)(10) Election) and Sellers shall
pay any income Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. Buyer shall cause
the Company to furnish information to the Sellers as reasonably requested by
the Sellers to allow the Sellers to satisfy their obligations under this
Section 8.02 in accordance with past custom and practice. Buyer covenants
that it will not cause or permit the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer to:
(i) take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of
business, including, but not limited to, the distribution of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability
or reduce any Tax Asset of the Sellers Affiliated Group, (ii) make any
election or deemed election under Section 338 of the Code or any comparable
provision under applicable law (other than the Section 338(h)(10)
Election) that will adversely affect the Sellers; or (iii) change any prior
Company Tax election in a manner that increases Tax liability or reduces any
Tax Asset of any Seller or the Sellers Affiliated Group in respect of any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed all separate Tax Returns for the Company ( _i.e._ ,
Tax Returns

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

other than Combined Tax Returns described in Section 8.02), if any, that are
first due and required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the
operations of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and timely pay amounts
shown as due on such Returns. Sellers shall indemnify Buyer for all
Taxes shown on such Tax Return to the extent provided in Section 8.05. Any
such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
and without a change of any election or any accounting method and shall be
submitted by Buyer to each Seller (together with schedules, statements and,
to the extent requested by any Seller, supporting documentation) at least 45
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. Sellers
shall furnish Buyer access to information, in a manner consistent with access
provided pursuant to Section 5.02(c), as reasonably requested by Buyer to
allow Buyer to satisfy its obligations under this Section 8.02 in accordance
with past custom and practice. The Sellers shall have the right to review
and comment with respect to such Returns and all work papers and procedures
used to prepare any such Tax Returns. If any Seller, within ten business days
after delivery of any such Tax Returns, notifies Buyer in writing that it
objects to any of the items in such Tax Return, the parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve the dispute prior to the due date for filing any such
Tax Returns. If the parties cannot resolve any such dispute, the dispute
shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline
for filing such Tax Return) by the Independent Firm. Upon resolution of all
such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be adjusted to reflect such
resolution and shall be binding upon the parties without further adjustment.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Firm shall be borne equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. Buyer shall also
cause the Company to prepare and file separate income Tax Returns for all
Post-Closing Tax Periods, or shall include the Companys taxable income from
Post-Closing Tax Periods in the Combined Tax Returns of Buyer or its
Affiliates.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Article 8, the taxable income of the Company shall
be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period by closing the books of the Company as of the end of the Closing Date.
All income and gain resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election shall be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Period.  For this purpose, the taxable year of
any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company owns an
interest shall be deemed to have ended at the end of the Closing Date.  In
the case of any property Taxes or other periodic Taxes (excluding income and
other income based Taxes) (" **Non-Income Taxes** ") imposed on the Company
for a taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date,
the amount of such any such periodic Non-Income Taxes imposed for such period
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing
Tax Period in the ratio that the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
bears to the number of days in the Post-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(d) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to each Seller all (i)
refunds of Taxes received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company of

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

Taxes paid by such Seller with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (except
any such refunds receivable that are taken into account in the calculation of
Final Working Capital) and (ii) without duplication, amounts representing the
excess of any amounts taken into account as liabilities for Taxes in
connection with the determination of Closing Working Capital over the amount
of such Taxes actually paid by Buyer. If, in lieu of receiving any such
refund, the Company elects to reduce a Tax liability with respect to a Post-
Closing Tax Period or elects to increase a Tax Asset that can be carried
forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid to the relevant Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax liability or
the amount of any benefit resulting from such increase in Tax Assets, as the
case may be. The Sellers agree to indemnify Buyer for any Taxes resulting
from a subsequent disallowance of such refund or Tax benefit to the extent
paid or credited to the Sellers, on audit or otherwise.

  



  

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property
transfer Tax and any similar Tax, but excluding income Taxes) shall be borne
and paid equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand, and the parties will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and,
if required by applicable law, the parties will, and will cause the Company
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

Section 8.03 _. Tax Sharing. _Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements
between the Company and any member of the Sellers Affiliated Group shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date.  After such date the Company shall not
have any further rights or liabilities thereunder. This Agreement shall be
the sole Tax sharing agreement relating to the Company for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods.

  



  

Section 8.04 _. Cooperation on Tax Matters. _Buyer and the Sellers agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Company as is reasonably necessary for the filing
of any Tax Return (including any report required pursuant to Section 6043 of
the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), for the
preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment.  Buyer and the
Sellers agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and records
pertinent to the Company until the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers)
has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. Each party shall
give the other party reasonable notice prior to transferring, discarding or
destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters and, if the
other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take possession of
copies of such books and records. Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with
each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the
Company for any Tax

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

purposes and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other
documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this subsection.

  



  

Section 8.05 _. Tax Indemnification. _(a) Each of the Sellers shall indemnify
the Company, Buyer and Buyers Affiliates, and hold them harmless from and
against, any loss, claim, liability, expense or other damage, including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and reasonable accountants fees and
expenses (collectively a " **Tax Loss** ") resulting from or attributable to
(i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company for or allocable to
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except for any interest or penalties
attributable to Buyers failure to perform its obligations pursuant to
Section 8.02(b), (ii) all Taxes of any Affiliated Group of which the Company
(or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior
to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or
regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Company)
imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or under any
law by reason of an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, and
(iv) any breach or misrepresentation of the Sellers representations,
warranties and covenants under Section 3.14 and this Article 8; _provided_
, however, that in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)) above,
the Sellers shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the
amount of liability, if any, for such Taxes included in the determination of
Closing Working Capital as a Current Liability.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers and the Sellers Affiliates, and hold
them harmless from and against, any Tax Loss resulting from or attributable
to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company that are
allocable to Post-Closing Tax Periods, and (ii) any breach of Buyers
covenants under this Article 8.

  



  

(c) The determination of the amount payable to or by any party under Section
8.03 or this Section 8.05 shall be made in the first instance by the party
seeking payment who (i) shall furnish the other party with a notice setting
forth in reasonable detail the computations and methods used in computing
such amount and (ii) shall provide such information with respect thereto as
may reasonably be requested. Any such notice pursuant to this Section
8.05(c) shall (A) be signed by an officer, (B) state in reasonable detail the
basis upon which such amount or adjustment has been determined and (C)
certify that such amount or adjustment has been determined pursuant to and in
compliance with this Agreement. Disputes arising under Section 8.03 or Section
8.05 and not resolved by mutual agreement within 30 days shall be resolved by
the Independent Firm. The Independent Firm shall resolve any disputed items
as soon as reasonably practicable (and the parties shall use their best
commercial efforts to cause such resolution to occur within 30 days) after
having the item referred to it, pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Firm shall be borne
equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. The
determination of the Independent Firm shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties.

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

(d) If Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company after Closing) receive
written notice from any Taxing Authority of a Tax Audit regarding potential
liability for or with respect to Taxes for which the Sellers may be required
to provide indemnity under Section 8.05 or which were taken into account in
the determination of Closing Working Capital as a Current Liability, or
receive any other written claim or demand for such Taxes from a Taxing
Authority for which the Sellers may be required to provide indemnity under
Section 8.05 or which were taken into account in the determination of Closing
Working Capital as a Current Liability, Buyer shall promptly notify each
Seller in writing of such Tax Audit, notice, demand or claim. The Sellers
may discharge, at any time, their indemnification obligation under
this Section 8.05 with respect to such Tax Audit, demand or claim by paying
to Buyer the amount payable pursuant to Section 8.05, calculated on the
date of such payment. Alternatively, other than with respect to Buyer
Combined Tax Returns, the Sellers may, at their own expense, participate in
and, upon notice to Buyer, assume the defense of any such claim, suit,
action, litigation or proceeding (including any Tax Audit). If the Sellers
assume such defense, the Sellers shall have the sole discretion as to the
conduct of such defense but, other than in the case of any matter involving a
Seller Combined Tax Return, shall consult with Buyer and keep
Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of the Tax contest. Whether or not
any Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Except with
respect to any Tax not in excess of the amount of liability for that Tax
included in the determination of Closing Working Capital as a Current
Liability, the Sellers shall not settle any Tax claim, other than in the case
of any matter involving a Seller Combined Tax Return, that they are defending
hereunder without obtaining the approval of Buyer, not to be unreasonably
withheld.

  



  

(e) If any Seller receives written notice from any Taxing Authority of a Tax
Audit regarding potential liability for or with respect to Taxes for which
Seller may be entitled to payment from Buyer pursuant to Section 8.02(d) or
Buyer may be required to provide indemnity under Section 8.05(b), or
receives any other written claim or demand for such Taxes from a Taxing
Authority for which Seller may be entitled to payment from Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.02(d) or Buyer may be required to provide indemnity under Section
8.05(b), such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of such Tax Audit
notice, demand or claim. Buyer may discharge, at any time, its
indemnification obligation under this Section 8.05 with respect to such Tax
Audit, demand or claim by paying to the relevant Seller the amount payable
pursuant to Section 8.05(b), calculated on the date of such payment.
Alternatively, other than with respect to Seller Combined Tax Returns, Buyer
may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon notice to the relevant
Seller, assume the defense of any such claim, suit, action, litigation or
proceeding (including any Tax Audit). If Buyer assumes such defense, Buyer
shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense but shall,
other than with respect to Buyer Combined Tax Returns, consult with
the relevant Seller and keep such Seller reasonably informed as to the status
of such Tax

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

contest. Whether or not Buyer chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all
of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Buyer shall not settle any Tax claim, other than with respect to Buyer
Combined Tax Returns, that it is defending hereunder without obtaining the
approval of the relevant Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(f) Any Tax indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 8.05 shall be
made within 30 days after final determination of the Tax Loss to be
indemnified.

  



  

Section 8.06 _. Purchase Price Adjustment. _Any amount paid under Article 8
or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

ARTICLE 9 
 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

  



  

Section 9.01 _. Employee Benefits. _(a) Except to the extent otherwise
prohibited by applicable law, during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending 90 days thereafter, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide
to all employees of the Company who continue to be employed by the Company or
Buyer on and after the Closing Date rates of compensation (including base
wages or salary and bonus opportunity, but excluding equity or long
term incentives) no less favorable than the rates of compensation provided by
the Company to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
benefits no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided by
the Company to such continuing employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Nothing herein shall be construed, however, to require the Company or
Buyer to continue after Closing the employment of any Company employee or to
otherwise interfere with the Companys right to terminate any such employees
at any time after Closing.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, except to the extent otherwise prohibited by
applicable law, each employee of the Company shall receive service credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit
accrual purposes) for all periods of employment with the Company and its
Affiliates and predecessors thereto prior to the Closing Date under any
employee benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates in which such employee is
eligible to participate after the Closing Date, to the extent such credit
existed immediately prior to the Closing Date under the corresponding
Employee Plan maintained by the Company. Buyer will cause each employee of
the Company to receive credit immediately following the Closing Date for such
employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or unpaid leave balance as of the
Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Except to the extent otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Buyer will
cause to be waived all (i) pre-existing conditions and proof of insurability
provisions for all conditions that are covered by any employee benefits plan
of Buyer or its Affiliates in which any employee of the Company participates
and

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

that such employee or his or her covered dependents have as of the Closing
Date, and (ii) waiting periods under each plan that would otherwise be
applicable to newly hired employees, in each case with respect to any
employee of the Company to the same extent waived or satisfied under
the corresponding Employee Plan; provided the employee has no
intervening separation of service from the Company or Buyer after Closing of
more than 63 days.

  



  

(d) Buyer will cause any eligible expenses incurred by an employee of the
Company and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of any Employee Plan ending on the date such employees participation in such
Employee Plan ended to be accounted for in the corresponding new or existing
employee benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and/or his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new or existing
employee benefit plan.

representation or warranty (each such misrepresentation and breach, a "
**Warranty Breach** ") or breach of covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement (other than a covenant or
agreement made or to be performed pursuant to Article 8);  _provided_ that
with respect to indemnification by the Sellers for Warranty Breaches pursuant
to this Section, (i) with respect to any individual Warranty

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

Breach, no such Warranty Breach shall be deemed to have occurred unless the
amount of Damages with respect thereto exceeds $37,500, (ii) the Sellers
shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to

excess and (iii) the Sellers maximum liability for all Warranty Breaches

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies Delta and
its Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and

Warranty Breaches exceeds $5 million and then only to the extent of such
excess and (iii) Buyers maximum liability for all Warranty Breaches shall
not exceed $100 million.

  



  

Section 11.03 _. Procedures. _(a) The party seeking indemnification under
Section 11.02 (the " **Indemnified Party** ") agrees to give prompt notice to
the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " **Indemnifying Party**
") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action
or proceeding (" **Claim** ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information
with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely affected the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Claim asserted by any third party (" **Third Party Claim** ") and,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, shall be entitled to
assume the control of and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case
at its expense.

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03,
(i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim,
but only if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or if the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any Third
Party Claim that shall be settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. The Indemnified
Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party fully informed of the defense of any
Third Party Claim conducted by such Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged
to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

  



  

Section 11.04 _. Calculation of Damages. _(a) The amount of any
Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of
any (i) amounts recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor and (ii) amounts relating to such Damages paid or
payable by the Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates to the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates under either of the Delta Connection
Agreements. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for
any Damages, or pursuant to either of the Delta Connection Agreements,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection
with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any
(i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in
the Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter,
(ii) consequential or punitive Damages or (iii) Damages for lost profits.

  



  

Section 11.05 _. Exclusivity. _Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement or in any Related Agreement, effective as of the Closing, Buyer and
the Company waive any rights and claims they may have against either of the
Sellers, whether in law or in equity, relating to the Company or the Shares
or the transactions contemplated hereby.  The rights and claims waived by
Buyer and the Company include claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or
hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty,

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After
the Closing, Section 8.05 and Section 11.02 will provide the
exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or
other agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement or in any Related Agreement, effective as of the Closing, the
Sellers waive any rights and claims they may have against Buyer and the
Company relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
foregoing limitations shall not apply to any claims based on fraud.

  



  

Section 11.06 _. Knowledge. _Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the rights of the parties to indemnification based on the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) about the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation or warranty.

consultant or representative of such party) to any other party to this
Agreement; provided that if

  



  

53

fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party,

breach of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such
failing or breaching party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages
