sufficient to enable it to evaluate its investment, and (iii) the opportunity
to obtain such additional information that Aegean possesses or can acquire
without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to make an informed
investment decision with respect to the Consideration Shares. Each Seller
further acknowledges and agrees that except for the warranties and
representations set forth in this agreement, neither the Buyer nor Aegean has
made any representation or warranty, express or implied, of any nature
whatsoever concerning the Consideration Shares or Aegean. Each Seller has

accuracy of the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and
understandings of each Seller set forth herein in order to determine the

the Consideration Shares.

(other than the Buyer, the Company or any member of the Buyer\'s Tax Group but
including a Taxation Authority) any sum in respect of such Tax Liability
(other than by reason of the use or set off of a Buyer\'s Relief), the Buyer

third party and shall be further reduced by any amount of the payment by the
Sellers referred to in paragraph 5.1 that has previously been repaid to the

   6. |  

OVERPROVISIONS, RELIEFS AND REBATES

   
---|--- 
  

  

   6.1 |  

The Sellers may, at any time, require the Company to obtain (at the reasonable
expense of the Sellers), a certificate from the Auditors as to:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    | (a) |  

whether any provision for taxation (other than deferred tax) in the Accounts,
or a provision of EUR 1,864,093 for taxation arising in the period from 1
January 2017 to 31 December 2017, has proved to be overstated (an
"Overprovision");

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (b) |  

whether the Company has received and retained any repayment of Tax (other than
a repayment the right to which arose in the ordinary course of business
between the Accounts Date and Completion) in respect of any period prior to
Completion; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (c) |  

whether any Tax Liability which has resulted in a payment being made by the
Sellers under this Schedule or under the Tax Warranties has resulted in the
reduction or elimination of a liability to Tax of the Company in respect of
which the Sellers would not have been liable under this Schedule (a "Saving"),

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

and, if so, the amount or value of that Overprovision, repayment or Saving
(the "Certified Amount").

  

   6.2 |  

An over provision from any of the following matters shall not be an over-
provision within paragraph 6.1 if it arises as a consequence of:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    | (a) |  

the use or set off of:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (i) |  

any Buyer\'s Relief (other than a use or set off made in respect of Income,
Profits or Gains or Tax arising in the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December
2017); or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (ii) |  

any Relief which has been taken into account in computing the liability of
each of the Sellers under the Tax Warranties or this Schedule; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (b) |  

any change in the rates of Tax made after Completion, the coming into force
after Completion of, or any introduction or change after Completion in, any
law, rule, regulation or published practice of any Taxation Authority of
general application; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (c) |  

an act of the Buyer or any of the Buyer\'s Tax Group carried out after
Completion.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

   6.3 |  

For the purposes of paragraph 6.1, no Saving shall be treated as having arisen
until it has been realised by the Company either by way of a repayment of or
by a reduction in Tax which would otherwise have become due and payable and in
particular nothing in this paragraph 6 shall require the Buyer to procure that
the Company utilises the Saving prior to any other Relief (save and to the
extent that the Saving would otherwise have been lost, in which case the
Saving shall be used in priority to such other Relief unless that other Relief
would itself have been lost).

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

99  

  


 

  

   6.4 |  

If the Auditors give a certificate in accordance with paragraph 6.1:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    | (a) |  

the Certified Amount shall first be set off against any payment then due from
the Sellers under this Schedule or in respect of a claim under the Tax
Warranties;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (b) |  

to the extent that the Certified Amount exceeds the amount of any payment then
due from the Sellers under this Schedule or in respect of a claim under the
Tax Warranties, a refund shall be made to the Sellers of any previous payments
made under this Schedule or in respect of claims under the Tax Warranties and
not previously refunded under this paragraph 6.4(b); and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (c) |  

any remaining excess shall be carried forward and set off against any future
payments which may become due from the Sellers under this Schedule or in
respect of the Tax Warranties.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

   7. |  

BUYER\'S COVENANT

   
---|--- 
  

  

   7.1 |  

The Buyer hereby covenants with the Sellers to pay to the Sellers an amount or
amounts equal to:

   
---|---

Seller) becomes liable as a result of the Company failing after Completion to
discharge any Tax Liability when payable; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (b) |  

all reasonable costs or expenses properly incurred by the Sellers, or company
related to any Seller, in connection with any such liability or increased

The Sellers shall not be entitled to recover any amount under paragraph 7.1 in
respect of any liability to Tax, cost or expense:

unless notice of the liability is given in writing by the Sellers to the Buyer
specifying (in reasonable detail so far as practicable) the nature of the
claim and the amount claimed;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (b) |  

to the extent that the Sellers, or company related to any Seller, recovers an
amount in respect of that liability to Tax, cost or expense from any other
person (other than any Seller or person related to any Seller) under any
relevant statute, law, or any other form of legislation;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (c) |  

the Company or the Buyer discharges or has discharged such Tax by direct
payment to the Tax Authority

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (d) |  

an amount in respect of such Tax Liability has previously been paid to any of
the Sellers; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (e) |  

to the extent that the Sellers are liable in respect thereof under this
Schedule and has not satisfied such liability.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

   7.3 |  

Paragraphs 9 (Date of Payment) and 8 (Conduct of Claims) of this Schedule
shall apply to the covenant contained in paragraph 7.1 as they apply to the
covenants contained in paragraph 2, replacing the references to the Sellers
with Buyer (and vice versa) and making any other modifications.

CONDUCT OF CLAIMS

   
---|--- 
  

  

   8.1 |  

If the Buyer or the Company becomes aware of a Tax Claim that could give rise
to a liability of the Sellers under paragraph 2, the Buyer shall or shall
procure that the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any
event within 15 Business Days of the Buyer or the Company becoming so aware
(and, in the event that the Company receives a Tax Claim in relation to which
an appeal may be made or other action taken within a specified period of time,
the Buyer shall give written notice to the Seller prior to the date that falls
ten Business Days before the expiry of the specified period), give written
notice to the Sellers of the Tax Claim containing, to the extent reasonably
practicable, a description of such claim and the estimated total amount of the
claim, provided that the giving of such notice shall not be a condition
precedent to the liability of the Sellers.

   
---|--- 
  

  

   8.2 |  

If the Sellers should become aware of a Tax Claim for whatever reason, the
Sellers give written notice to the Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable
containing, to the extent reasonably practicable, a description of such claim
and the estimated total amount of the claim and the Buyer shall be deemed to
have given the Sellers notice of the Tax Claim on receipt of such notification
for the purposes of this paragraph 8.

   
---|--- 
  

  

   8.3 |  

Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph 8, the Buyer shall (and
where relevant, shall procure that the Company shall) take such action as the
Sellers may reasonably request by notice in writing to avoid, dispute, defend,
resist, appeal or compromise any Tax Claim (Disputed Tax Claim) or any matter
relating to the Disputed Tax Claim but only provided that the Sellers shall
first (to the Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction) indemnify the Buyer and/or the
Company (as required by the Buyer) against any losses, damages, costs or
expenses that it may suffer or incur as a result of taking this action
(including any additional liability to Tax).

   
---|--- 
  

  

   8.4 |  

Without prejudice to the liability of the Sellers under this Schedule, the
Buyer shall not be obliged to take or procure the taking of any action under
paragraph 8.3 in respect of any Tax Claim:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    | (a) |  

to the extent that it would involve the Company contesting any Disputed Tax
Claim before any court or other appellate body (excluding the Taxation
Authority that has made the Disputed Tax Claim) unless in the written opinion
of Tax Counsel of appropriate relevant experience appointed by agreement
between the Sellers and the Buyer an appeal would be reasonable in all the
circumstances having regard to the amounts involved, the likelihood of success
and any future Tax Liability or other liability of the Company or the Buyer\'s
Tax Group to the extent that such liability is not or may not be recoverable
under paragraph 2;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (b) |  

where the Tax Claim or action derives from or arises out of or is in
connection with any dishonest or fraudulent act or omission or wilful default
by or of the Sellers at any time or by or of the Company before Completion or
if the Buyer has reasonable grounds to so believe;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (c) |  

should the Sellers, following receipt of written notice of the Tax Claim from
the Buyer in accordance with paragraph 8.1:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (i) |  

fail within fifteen Business Days (or ten Business Days in a case where there
is a time limit for an appeal that has been notified to the Sellers) to serve
notice on the Buyer under paragraph 8.3;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

101  

  


 

  

    | (ii) |  

fail within ten Business Days to notify the Buyer in writing of any further
action to be taken by the Buyer or the Company under paragraph 8.3 where the
Buyer at any time seeks instructions from the Sellers;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (iii) |  

fail to adequately indemnify the Buyer and/or the Company (as appropriate)
under paragraph 8.3; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (iv) |  

fail to further indemnify the Buyer to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Buyer in the event that the indemnity previously provided becomes, or is
likely to become, in the reasonable opinion of the Buyer insufficient;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (d) |  

should the Sellers each:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (i) |  

become insolvent and corporate action or other steps are taken or legal
proceedings are started for its winding up, dissolution or administration or
for the appointment of a receiver, administrator, trustee or similar officer
of the Sellers or any of its assets; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (ii) |  

be unable to pay its debts as they fall due, start negotiations with a
creditor with a view to the general readjustment or rescheduling of its
indebtedness or make a general assignment for the benefit of, or a composition
with, its creditors;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (e) |  

if, in the Buyer\'s reasonable opinion, the action requested by the Sellers
under paragraph 8.3 is likely to:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (i) |  

give rise to a liability of the Buyer or the Company to Tax that is not
adequately covered by any indemnity given under this paragraph 8;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (ii) |  

affect adversely the liability of the Buyer or the Company to Tax or the
business or financial interests of any of them or of any person connected with
any of them (in each case) in a material respect or is or contrary to the
legal obligations of any of them or of any person connected with any of them;
or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (iii) |  

affect adversely the relationship of the Buyer or the Company with any Tax
Authority;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (f) |  

in respect of a liability that falls within paragraph 2.2;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (g) |  

if the Company would be required to appeal against any assessment or demand
for Tax where it is a requirement for such an appeal that the Taxation be paid
unless payment has previously been made by the Sellers to the Buyer of an
amount equal to that Taxation and in respect of it.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

   8.5 |  

If paragraph 8.3 does not apply by virtue of any provision in paragraph 8.4,
the Buyer or the Company (as the case may be) may satisfy or settle the Tax
Liability on terms as it may in its absolute discretion acting in good faith
think fit without prejudice to any of the Buyer\'s rights under this Schedule.

---|--- 
  

  

   12.2 |  

The Sellers shall (at the Sellers\' expense) provide the Buyer and the Company

---|--- 
  

  

   12.3 |  

The Buyer shall provide the Sellers with drafts of all Tax Documents which it
intends to submit to a Taxation Authority in relation to the Straddle Period.

Authority ("Submission Date"). Insofar as the drafts concern a matter for
which the Sellers may be liable under this Schedule or under the Tax
Warranties, the Buyer shall incorporate any reasonable comments of the Sellers

   13.2 |  

Should the Sellers be required by law to make a deduction or withholding from
any payment referred to in this agreement, the Sellers shall provide such
evidence of the relevant withholding as the Buyer may reasonably require and

been made, leave the Buyer with the same amount as the Buyer would have
received had no deduction or withholding been made.

   
---|--- 
  

  

   13.3 |  

If any sum payable by the Sellers to the Buyer under this agreement is subject
to Tax in the hands of the Buyer, the Sellers shall pay such additional amount

that the Buyer would have received if the payment had not been subject to Tax.

   
---|--- 
  

  

   13.4 |  

If the Buyer would, but for the availability of a Buyer\'s Relief, incur a

acceptable to the Company\'s transfer agent (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

  

 

136  

  


 

  

(c) The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the
Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective during the Effectiveness Period.

  

(d) In the event an offering of Registrable Securities involves one or more
Underwriters, the Requesting Holders, acting unanimously, shall select the
lead Underwriter and any additional Underwriters in connection with the
offering from a list of nationally recognized investment banks reasonably
agreed to between the Company and such Requesting Holders.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.01, the
Investors holding Registrable Securities may not make a Request within the
90-day period after a Registration Statement for Common Stock has been filed
by the Company (for its own account or for any other security holders) with
and declared effective by the SEC, unless such Registration Statement has been
withdrawn; _provided_ , _however_ , the forgoing limitation will not apply if
the Investors holding Registrable Securities were not given the opportunity,
in accordance with Section 3.02, to include their Registrable Securities in
the Registration Statement described in this Section 3.01(e).

  

(f) Any Investor holding Registrable Securities included in a Registration
Statement shall be permitted to remove all or any part of the Registrable
Securities held by it from any Registration Statement at any time prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Request shall nonetheless count
as a Request for purposes of determining when future Requests can be requested
pursuant to this Section 3.01, unless the Investor reimburses the Company for
all registration expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such
withdrawn Request.

  

SECTION 3.02 _Piggyback Registration_. If the Company proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of
Common Stock (other than a Registration Statement on Form F-4 or S-8 (or any
substitute form that may be adopted by the SEC)) whether for its own account
or for the account of one or more shareholders of the Company, and the
registration form to be used may be used for any registration of Registrable
Securities, then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing
to the Investors holding Registrable Securities as soon as practicable (but in
no event less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated filing date), and
such notice shall, subject to Section 3.03, offer the Investors holding
Registrable Securities the opportunity to register such number of Registrable
Securities as the Investors may Request on the same terms and conditions as
the Company\'s or such holder\'s Common Stock (a " _Piggyback Registration_
"). The Company shall control the determination of the form of any offering
contemplated by this Section 3.02, including whether any such offering shall
be in the form of an underwritten offering and, if any such offering is in the
form of an underwritten offering, the Company shall select the lead
Underwriter and any additional Underwriters in connection with such offering.

  

SECTION 3.03 _Reduction of Offering_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein, if the lead Underwriter of an underwritten offering described in
Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 delivers a written opinion to the Company that
the securities (including all Registrable Securities) that the Requesting
Holders, the Company and any other Persons intend to include in any
Registration Statement is such that the success of any such offering would be
materially and adversely affected, including the price at which the securities
can be sold, then the number of shares of Common Stock to be included in the
Registration Statement for the account of the Requesting Holders and the
Company and any other Persons shall be reduced pro rata to the extent
necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in any such
Registration Statement to the amount recommended by such lead Underwriter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) priority in the case of a Request pursuant
to Section 3.01 shall be (i) first, the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the Registration Statement for the account of the Requesting
Holders (allocated pro rata among them based on the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be registered by the Requesting Holders or in such
manner as they may otherwise agree), (ii) second, securities proposed to be
offered by the Company for its own account and (iii) third, securities
requested to be registered by the holders thereof, other than the Requesting
Holders (the " _Other Holders_ ") pursuant to a contractual right of
registration, (b) priority in the case of a Piggyback Registration initiated
by the Company for its own account pursuant to Section 3.02 shall be (i)
first, securities initially proposed to be offered by the Company for its own
account, and (ii) second, the Registrable Securities requested to be included
in the Registration Statement for the account of the Requesting Holders
(allocated pro rata among them based on the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be registered by the Requesting Holders or in such manner as they
may otherwise agree) and (iii) third, pro rata among any other securities
requested to be included therein by Other Holders pursuant to a contractual
right of registration (allocated pro rata among them based on the number of
securities requested to be registered by such Other Holders or in such manner
as they may otherwise agree), and (c) priority with respect to inclusion of
securities in a Registration Statement initiated by the Company for the
account of Other Holders pursuant to a contractual right of registration
afforded such Other Holders shall be (i) first, securities requested to be
registered by such Other Holders for the account of such Other Holders, (ii)
second, the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the
Registration Statement for the account of the Requesting Holders and other
securities requested to be included therein by any other Other Holders
pursuant to a contractual right of registration (allocated pro rata among them
based on the number of securities requested to be registered by the Requesting
Holders and such Other Holders or in such manner as they may otherwise agree),
and (iii) third, securities proposed to be offered by the Company for its own
account.

make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, and the Company will prepare a supplement or
amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the

responsibility, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company
and its subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by any

_however_ , that (i) Records and information obtained hereunder shall be used
by such Inspector only to exercise their due diligence responsibility, (ii)

other order from a court or governmental authority of competent jurisdiction
and (iii) the Company may require, as a condition to the provision to any

the actions contemplated by Sections 3.01, 3.02 and 3.04 with respect to an
offering of Registrable Securities shall be subject to the following
conditions:

  

(a) the Requesting Holders shall conform to all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the offering and sale of
securities;

  

(b) the Requesting Holders shall advise each Underwriter through which any of
the Registrable Securities are offered that the Registrable Securities are
part of a distribution that is subject to the prospectus delivery requirements
of the Securities Act;

  

(c) the Company may require the Requesting Holders to furnish to the Company
such information regarding the Requesting Holders or the distribution of the
Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request
in writing, in each case only as required by the Securities Act or the rules
and regulations thereunder or under state securities or blue sky laws; and

  

(d) in any underwritten offering pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.02
hereof, any Requesting Holder, together with the Company, shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters
selected for such underwriting, as well as such other documents customary in
similar offerings, including custody agreements, powers of attorney and
indemnification provisions relating to information provided in writing by the
Requesting Holders.

  

Each Requesting Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3.04(c)
hereof or a condition described in Section 3.06 hereof, all Requesting Holders
will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Registration Statement covering the sale of such shares of Registrable
Securities until the Requesting Holder\'s receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3.04(c) hereof or
notice from the Company of the termination of the Deferral Period and, if so
directed by the Company, will promptly deliver to the Company all copies
(other than any permanent file copies then in such Requesting Holder\'s
possession) of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
that was current at the time of receipt of such notice.

  

SECTION 3.06 _Deferral Period_. The Company\'s obligations pursuant to
Sections 3.01 and 3.02 hereof shall be suspended if compliance with such
obligations would (a) violate applicable Law or (b) require the Company to
disclose a material financing, acquisition or other corporate development, and
the proper officers of the Company have determined, in the good faith exercise
of their reasonable business judgment, that such disclosure is not in the best
interests of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such suspension
shall not exceed 90 consecutive days and all such suspensions shall not exceed
120 days in any twelve-month period (the " _Deferral Period_ "). The Company

139  

  


 

  

SECTION 3.07 _Registration Expenses._ All fees and expenses incident to the
Company\'s performance of or compliance with the registration obligations of
this Article III, including all fees and expenses of compliance with
securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel for any Underwriters in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Securities), printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses of
the Company, any registration or filing fees payable under any Federal or
state securities or blue sky laws, the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any listing or quoting of the securities to be registered on
any national securities exchange or automated quotation system, fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company and its independent certified public
accountants (including the expenses of any comfort letters required by or
incident to such performance) and the fees and expenses of other Persons
retained by the Company, will be borne by the Company. The Requesting Holders
will bear and pay any underwriting and placement discounts and commissions,
agency and placement fees and brokers\' commissions applicable to securities
offered for its account and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or
disposition of such securities. The Company shall reimburse the Requesting
Holders for the reasonable legal fees and expenses of one law firm chosen by
the Requesting holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in
such registration or sale, not to exceed $50,000 in the aggregate per annum,
in connection with the registration of their Registrable Securities.

  

SECTION 3.08 _Indemnification_. (a) In connection with any registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.02 hereof, the Company
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Requesting Holder, its
partners, directors, members, officers and employees, and any Person who
controls such Requesting Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and
assigns of all of the foregoing Persons, from and against any loss, damage,
expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation)
which, jointly or severally, such Requesting Holder or any such Person may
incur under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise,
insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as
amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), prospectus or
preliminary prospectus contained therein, or arises out of or is based upon
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except insofar
as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in, and in conformity with, information concerning the Requesting
Holder, its partners, directors, members, officers or controlling Persons
furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Requesting Holder to the Company
expressly for use in, the Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact in the Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus in connection with such information, which material
fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was
required to be stated in such Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or was necessary to make such information not
misleading. Notwithstanding the forgoing, with respect to any untrue statement
or omission of material fact made in any prospectus or preliminary prospectus,
the provisions of this Section 3.08 shall not inure to the benefit of any
Investor from whom the Person asserting any such loss, claim, damages,
liabilities or expenses purchased the Registrable Securities to the extent
that it shall be established that (i) any such loss, claim, damages,
liabilities or expenses of such Person arises primarily from the fact that the
Investor sold Registrable Securities to such a Person, (ii) there was not sent
or given a copy of the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented) at or
prior to the written confirmation of such sale and (iii) the final prospectus
(as amended or supplemented) would have corrected any such untrue statement or
omission of a material fact.

  

 

140  

  


 

  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement, the Requesting Holders will
furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits with respect
to the Requesting Holders as the Company reasonably requests, including
information relating to the Requesting Holders for use in connection with any
such Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus and agree to
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its
directors, officers and employees and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity
from the Company to the Requesting Holders, but only in connection with
information relating to the Requesting Holders, as the case may be, furnished
to the Company in writing by or on behalf of the Requesting Holders expressly
for use in the Registration Statement, the prospectus, any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.

  

(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") is brought
against a Person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") in respect of which indemnity
may be sought against the Company or a Requesting Holder (as applicable, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this Section
3.08, such Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing,
and in reasonable detail to the extent known, of the Proceeding promptly after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Proceeding, and shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Party\'s
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice or such documents shall
not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Agreement except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure. In case any such Proceeding shall be brought against any
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, in its sole discretion, to
assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, (x) the
Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith (such cooperation to include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Proceeding, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder) and
(y) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party, in connection with the
defense thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party may take
any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Proceeding prior to the time
that it receives a notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
the defense of such Proceeding, it is understood that the Indemnifying Party
shall not, in connection with any one such Proceeding or separate but
substantially similar or related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one
separate firm of local attorneys in each such jurisdiction) at any time for
such Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense
of the Proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such Proceeding. The Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any settlement of a Proceeding that an
Indemnified Party may effect without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of
which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim
and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of
any settlement or judgment to which it consented in accordance with the terms
of such settlement or judgment.

  

 

141  

  


 

  

SECTION 3.09 _Rule 144_. For so long as the Company is subject to the
requirements of Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Act, the Company
agrees that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by
the SEC thereunder and it will take such further action as the Investors
reasonably may request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
the Investors to sell Registrable Securities within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 or (b) any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of an Investor, the Company
will deliver to such Investor a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such requirements.

  

SECTION 3.10 _Lockup_. If and to the extent requested by the managing
Underwriters of an underwritten public offering of Common Stock, the Company
and the Investors agree to enter into a reasonable and customary lock-up
agreement with the Underwriters.

  

SECTION 3.11 _Termination of Registration Rights_. The registration rights
contained in this Article III with respect to a particular Investor shall
terminate on the date on which all Consideration Shares held by such Investor
that are subject to this Agreement cease to be Registrable Securities.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the registration rights contained in this
Article III shall terminate in any event with respect to any Investor when any
such holder no longer owns any Registrable Securities. In addition, even if
the registration rights contained in this Article III are no longer in effect,
in the event that an Investor intends to dispose of a significant number of
shares of Common Stock and such disposition could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse impact on the trading price of shares of Common Stock or
otherwise have an adverse impact on the market for Common Stock, the Company
and such Investor shall cooperate in connection with such disposition and
shall take commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of
any such disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the
restrictions contained in Article V, nothing in this sentence shall be deemed
to restrict an Investor in connection with the sale of any Common Stock
(including the size or timing of such disposition).

  

ARTICLE IV 
  
  _Limitations on Purchases of_ 
  _Equity Securities and Other Actions_

  

SECTION 4.01 _Purchases of Equity Securities_. Subject to the exceptions set
forth in Section 4.03, during the Standstill Period, the Investor Parties

subsidiaries, or any equity interest therein, (ii) sale or purchase of a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,

or not relating to the election or removal of Directors), or agree or announce
its intention to vote with any Person undertaking a "solicitation";

  

 

142  

  


 

  

(c) form, join or in any way participate in a 13D Group with respect to any

Securities in a voting trust or enter into any other arrangement or agreement
with respect to the voting thereof;

  

(e) seek, alone or in concert with other Persons, additional representation on
the Board or seek the removal of any member of the Board that is not an

inconsistent with this Agreement;

of a special meeting of the shareholders of the Company;

  

(g) make any proposals to be considered at any special or annual meeting of
shareholders of the Company that involve any of the matters which are
prohibited by Section 4.02, or which otherwise seek to control, change or
influence the management, the Board, or the Company\'s policies, or which are
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;

  

(h) enter into any arrangements, understandings or agreements (whether written
or oral) with, or advise, finance or assist any other Persons in connection
with any of the foregoing, or disclose any intention, plan or arrangement
prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the foregoing, or make or take any action
that would reasonably be expected to cause the Company to make a public
announcement regarding any intention of any Investor Party to take an action
that would be prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the foregoing; or

  

(i) request, propose or otherwise seek any amendment or waiver of or release
from, or otherwise act to contest the validity of, the restrictions set forth
in the provisions of Article IV; _provided_ , however, that nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to restrict what any Investor Director may say or
discuss at any meeting of the Board.

  

SECTION 4.03 _Standstill Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Sections 4.01 and 4.02,
during the Standstill Period, the Investor Parties:

  

(a) may acquire the Consideration Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase
Agreement;

(d) shall be permitted (i) if the Company publicly announces its intent to
pursue a Buyout Transaction, to privately make a counteroffer or proposal to
the Board (an " _Investor Buyout Counteroffer_ ") and (ii) if the Board
approves, recommends or accepts (including by entering into a definitive
agreement with respect to) a Buyout Transaction with an Unaffiliated Third
Party (with the Investor Directors recusing themselves from any and all
consideration by the Board or committee thereof), to take any of the actions
described in subsections (a) through (i) of Section 4.02, subject to 5.01(a),
until such Buyout Transaction is terminated or abandoned, and such standstill
restrictions set forth in subsections (a) through (i) of Section 4.02 shall
become applicable again upon any such termination or abandonment (unless the
Board determines that such standstill restrictions shall cease earlier, with
the Investor Directors recusing themselves from any and all consideration by
the Board or any committee thereof); provided that, following the termination
or abandonment of such Buyout Transaction, Section 4.02 shall not be deemed to
have been breached in connection with any action taken by the Investor Parties
during the time that Section 4.02 became inapplicable pursuant to this Section
4.03(d), provided that such action is discontinued upon the receipt by the
Investor Parties of a written notice from the Board of the termination or
abandonment of the applicable Buyout Transaction;

  

 

143  

  


 

  

(e) shall have the right, if an Unaffiliated Third Party commences a proxy

result in members of the Board in office immediately prior to such event
constituting less than a majority of the Board thereafter, to take any action
described in subsection (b) of Section 4.02, but only in respect of support of
the Company\'s director nominees and the Investor Directors and opposition to
such Unaffiliated Third Party\'s director nominees for such proxy context,
until the date that the Board delivers written notice to the Investor Parties
that in the Board\'s good faith determination such proxy contest has concluded
or been withdrawn; and

  

(f) shall have the right to make requests to the Board to amend or waive any
of the limitations set forth in Section 4.01 or 4.02, which the Other
Directors, acting by majority, may accept or reject in their sole discretion;
provided, however, that (i) any such request shall not be publicly disclosed
by the Investor Parties and (ii) any such request shall be made in a manner
that is not reasonably likely to require the public disclosure of such request
by the Company.

  

SECTION 4.04 _Shareholder Rights Plans_. Effective upon the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall have amended its Stockholders Rights Agreement,
dated August 14, 2009, by and between the Company and Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., in order to exempt, until the Standstill Expiration Date, the
Investor Parties from the definition of "Acquiring Person" thereunder for so
long as the Aggregate Ownership Limitation is not exceeded. Until the
Standstill Expiration Date, neither the Company, the Board nor any committee
thereof shall, without the prior approval of the majority of the Investors,
extend, declare or enter into any shareholder rights plan, rights agreement or
any other "poison pill", "proxy put" or other antitakeover arrangement
(collectively, a " _Plan_ "), other than such Plan that is in existence on the
Completion Date, if such Plan would restrict the Investor Parties from (i)
engaging in any transaction, or taking any action, consistent with the terms
of this Agreement, to acquire Equity Securities so long as, after giving
effect to such acquisition, the Aggregate Ownership Limitation would not be
exceeded, or (ii) consummating an Investor Buyout Counteroffer made in
accordance with subsection (d) of Section 4.03.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.05 _Restriction on Transfer of Interests of the Shareholders_. Until
the Standstill Expiration Date, each Shareholder shall not, without the
Company\'s prior written consent, Transfer any of its respective equity
interests in any of the Investors, other than to testamentary transferees or
other Shareholders that, in each case, are or, simultaneously with such
Transfer and pursuant to documentation in form and substance acceptable to the
Company, become party to this Agreement.

  

ARTICLE V 
  
  _Transfer of Voting Stock_

  

SECTION 5.01 _Limitation on Transfer of Voting Stock_.

  

(a) Each Investor hereby agrees not to Transfer (i) any Consideration Shares,
beneficial ownership thereof or any other interest therein, prior to the
expiration of the Restricted Period or (ii) any Consideration Shares that are
subject to the Extended Restricted Period, beneficial ownership thereof or any
other interest therein, prior to the expiration of the Extended Restricted
Period, except, in each case, for a Transfer of Consideration Shares (which
Transfer includes all beneficial ownership, voting rights and other interests
therein) to (i) other Shareholders that are party to this Agreement or (ii) an
Affiliate of an Investor or an Investor Controlled Affiliate of a Shareholder
(a " _Permitted Transferee_ "), provided that such Permitted Transferee shall
agree in writing for the benefit of the Company (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as if such Permitted Transferee was an Investor hereunder (each such
Transfer, a " _Permitted Transfer_ "), in which case, for the purposes of this
Agreement, such Permitted Transferee shall be deemed to be an "Investor" as
such term is used herein. Any purported Transfer that is not in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Section 5.01 shall be, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, null and void ab initio, and, in addition to other
rights and remedies at law and in equity, the Company shall be entitled to
injunctive relief enjoining the prohibited action.

  

 

144  

  


 

  

(b) Each Shareholder agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its
Investor Controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, Transfer any
beneficially owned Voting Stock without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent may be given or withheld or made subject to such
conditions as are determined by the Company in its sole discretion) to (i) any
Person or 13D Group in an amount constituting 15% or more of the beneficially
owned Voting Stock then outstanding or (ii) any Person or 13D Group that,
immediately following such Transfer, and to the Shareholder\'s knowledge,
would beneficially own in the aggregate 15% or more of the Voting Stock then
outstanding (it being agreed that the Shareholder\'s knowledge shall be deemed
to include all then-available SEC Reports filed by such Person or 13D Group);
_provided_ , _that_ , this Section 5.01(b) shall not restrict the Investor
Parties from directly or indirectly selling, transferring or otherwise
disposing of Voting Stock that is not subject to the Restricted Period or
Extended Restricted Period (i) in connection with a tender or exchange offer
for Equity Securities (provided __ that the Board has not recommended to its
shareholders that such tender offer or exchange offer be rejected) or (ii) to
the extent permitted by Section 4.03(d).

  

SECTION 5.02 _Legend_. (a) The Company may place appropriate legends and/or
stop transfer order on the Consideration Shares held by the Investors setting
forth the restrictions referred to in the Share Purchase Agreement, in Section
5.01(a) and Section 5.03 of this Agreement, and any restrictions appropriate
for compliance with U.S. federal securities laws. The Investors agree with the
Company the Consideration Shares held by the Investors shall be marked with a
legend substantially in the form set forth below, as well as any additional
legend or restricted notation imposed or required by applicable securities
Laws:

  

THESE SECURITIES AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON THE EXCHANGE THEREOF HAVE
NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"SECURITIES ACT") OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION.
THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSED OF EXCEPT (1) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT (WHICH TRANSACTION SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT
REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS) OR
(2) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING TO SUCH
SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND THE SECURITIES LAWS OF OTHER
JURISDICTIONS.

  

THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE INVESTORS\'
RIGHTS AGREEMENT DATED [Ÿ], 2018 BY AND AMONG AEGEAN MARINE PETROLEUM NETWORK
INC. AND EACH OF THE INVESTORS LISTED ON SCHEDULE A THERETO AND THE
INDIVIDUALS LISTED ON SCHEDULE B THERETO, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.

  

(a) The Company will promptly cause the transfer agent to remove the
restrictive legend with respect to applicable Consideration Shares, upon
request, in order to permit the Investor Parties to engage in sales, transfers
and other dispositions that are not restricted hereunder or under U.S. federal
securities laws. Purported transfers of shares of Equity Securities that are
not in compliance with this Article V shall be void.

  

SECTION 5.03 _Shares Subject to Cancellation_. Each Investor, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Permitted Transferee hereunder, hereby understands
and agrees that during the Restricted Period and the Extended Restricted
Period, the Cancellable Shares held by such Investor or Permitted Transferee
may be cancelled by the Company in accordance with clause 4.6 of the Share
Purchase Agreement, without the prior consent or other action by such Investor
or Permitted Transferee.

  

 

145  

  


 

  

ARTICLE VI 
  
  _Restricted Business_

  

SECTION 6.01 _Non-Competition_. Each Shareholder agrees and undertakes to the
Company and its subsidiaries that it shall not, and shall cause each of its
Investor Controlled Affiliates not to, at any time during the Non-Competition
Period:

  

(a) in any geographic area in which the Business (or any part of it) is
carried on at the Completion Date, carry on or be employed, engaged, concerned
or interested in, or in any way assist, a Restricted Business;

  

(b) (i) canvass, solicit or otherwise seek the custom of any Restricted
Customer or Prospective Customer with a view to providing goods or services to
them in competition with the Business; or (ii) induce or attempt to induce a
Restricted Customer or Prospective Customer to cease or refrain from
conducting business with, or to reduce the amount of business conducted with,
or to vary adversely the terms upon which it conducts business with, H.E.C. or
any of its subsidiaries, or do any other thing which is reasonably likely to
have such an effect;

  

(c) have any business dealings with a Restricted Customer or a Prospective
Customer in connection with the provision of goods or services to them in
competition with the Business;

  

(d) have any business dealings with, or solicit, entice or attempt to entice
away, any person who is at the Completion Date, or has been at any time during
the period of 12 months immediately preceding the Completion Date, a supplier
of goods or services to H.E.C. or any of its subsidiaries, if such dealings,
solicitation or enticement causes or is reasonably likely to cause such
supplier to cease supplying, or to reduce its supply of goods or services to,
H.E.C. or any of its subsidiaries, or to vary adversely the terms upon which
it conducts business with H.E.C. or any of its subsidiaries; or

  

(e) offer employment to, enter into a contract for the services of, or
otherwise entice or attempt to entice away from H.E.C or any of its
subsidiaries, any Restricted Person, or procure or facilitate in relation to a
Restricted Person the making of any such offer or attempt by any other person;

  

SECTION 6.02 _Applicability_. The agreements and undertakings in Section 6.01
are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company and
its subsidiaries (including H.E.C. and its subsidiaries) and shall apply to
actions carried out by the relevant Shareholder and its Investor Controlled
Affiliates in any capacity (including as shareholder, partner, director,
principal, consultant, officer, employee, agent or otherwise) and whether
directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Shareholder or its Investor
Controlled Affiliates or on behalf of, or jointly with, any other person.

  

SECTION 6.03 _Exceptions_. Nothing in Section 6.01 shall prevent any
Shareholder or its Investor Controlled Affiliates from holding for investment
purposes only: (i) units of any authorised unit trust; or (ii) any class of
shares or securities of any company traded on the NYSE or another recognized
securities exchange.

  

SECTION 6.04 _Enforceability_. Each of the agreements and undertakings in
Section 6.01 is a separate agreement and undertaking by each Shareholder in
relation to itself and its interests and shall be enforceable by the Company
and its subsidiaries separately and independently of their right to enforce
any one or more of the other agreements and undertakings contained in that
clause.

  

SECTION 6.05 _Fair and Reasonable_. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
Shareholders have confidential information relating to the Business and that
the Company and its subsidiaries are entitled to protect the goodwill of the
Business as a result of its acquisition of H.E.C. Accordingly, each of the
covenants in Section 6.01 is considered fair and reasonable by the parties.

amended or waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by each of the Company and the Shareholders, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective;

such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or

147  

  


 

  

SECTION 7.03 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
"Articles" or "Sections", such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to
the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". All
references to "$" or "dollars" mean the lawful currency of the United States
of America. The terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when
used in the plural, and vice versa. Any agreement or instrument defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented. Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, all
references to any statute, rule or regulation are to the statute, rule or
regulation as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time
(and, in the case of statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated
under the statute) and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation
include any successor to the section. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

  

SECTION 7.04 _Termination_.

  

(a) _Automatic Termination_. Other than the termination provisions applicable
to particular Sections of this Agreement that are specifically provided
elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate, subject to
Section 7.04(b)(i), upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and the
Shareholders or upon the earlier of (i) the Change of Control of the Company
and (ii) at such time after the Completion Date when none of the Investor
Parties beneficially owns any shares of the Voting Stock.

  

(b) _Survival_. In the event that this Agreement shall terminate, all
provisions of this Agreement shall terminate and shall be void, except (i)
Article III shall survive any such termination until the Investors no longer
hold Registrable Securities and (ii) Articles I and VI and Section 3.08 shall
survive any such termination indefinitely.

  

SECTION 7.05 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall do and perform or
cause to be done and performed all further acts and shall execute and deliver
all other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as any other
party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 7.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment
without such prior written consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.06, the Investor
may assign, in whole or in part, this Agreement and its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder to (i) any of its Permitted Transferees in accordance
with Section 5.01(a) or (ii) any Person who acquires, directly or indirectly,
all or substantially all of its consolidated assets (including by way of
merger, amalgamation or otherwise by operation of law).

  

SECTION 7.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, counterclaim or
dispute of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in any way relating
to this Agreement, directly or indirectly, shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof. The parties declare that it is their intention
that this Agreement shall be regarded as made under the laws of the Republic
of the Marshall Islands and that the laws of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands shall be applied in interpreting its provisions in all cases where
legal interpretation shall be required.

  

 

148  

  


 

  

SECTION 7.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

SECTION 7.09 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement._ The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions (without the proof of actual damages)
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and that neither party nor any of their
respective Representatives shall oppose the granting of such relief, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each party also agrees that it and its Representatives shall waive any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such equitable relief. In addition, each of the parties irrevocably submits to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which
jurisdiction shall be exclusive, for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement in any court of the Republic of the Marshall Islands or that any
such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

  

SECTION 7.10 _Effectiveness._ This Agreement shall become effective upon the
Completion Date.

  

SECTION 7.11 _Confidentiality._ (a) The Shareholders agree to maintain, and
shall cause their respective subsidiaries and Investor Controlled Affiliates,
and its and their directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, counsel,
advisors, consultants and other Representatives (including any Investor
Director appointed pursuant to Section 2.01(a)) to maintain, the
confidentiality of all information obtained by the Investor Parties and their
Representatives from the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Representatives, and not to use such information for any purpose other than
(i) the evaluation and protection of the investment by the Investor Parties in
the Company, (ii) the exercise by the Investor Parties of any of its rights
under this Agreement (including the right to acquire more Voting Stock) and
(iii) the exercise by the Investor Directors of their fiduciary duties as
Directors of the Company.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or the Share
Purchase Agreement, the confidentiality obligations of Section 7.11(a) will
not apply to information obtained other than in violation of this Agreement
which:

  

(i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of Section 7.11(a) or of the Share Purchase Agreement; or

  

(ii) was or becomes available to the Investor Parties or their subsidiaries or
Representatives on a non-confidential basis by a third-party source who
obtained such information other than from any such Person; _provided_ that
such source is reasonably believed by each such Person not to be subject to an
obligation of confidentiality (whether by agreement or otherwise) to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries; and any of the Investor Parties, or their
subsidiaries or Representatives, may disclose such information to the extent
required to disclose by judicial or administrative process, or by other
requirements of applicable Law or regulation or any governmental authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent practicable, the disclosing party
shall (A) give the Company reasonable notice of any such requirement and the
opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures and (B) cooperate with the
Company in attempting to obtain such protective measures.

  

 

149  

  


 

  

SECTION 7.12 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement,
together with the Share Purchase Agreement and any other agreement expressly
contemplated herein or therein, constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties or their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except
as expressly set forth in Section 3.08, no provision of this Agreement shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

  

SECTION 7.13 _Severability._ If one or more provisions of this Agreement are
held to be unenforceable under applicable Law, such provision shall be deemed
to be excluded from this Agreement and the balance of this Agreement shall be
interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and shall be enforced in
accordance with its terms to the maximum extent permitted by Law, so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

SECTION 7.14 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, with the same effect
as if the signatures were upon the same instrument.

  

SECTION 7.15 _Acknowledgment of Securities Laws_. Each Shareholder hereby
acknowledges that it is aware, and that it will advise its Affiliates and
representatives who are provided the material non-public information that is
the subject of Section 7.11, that the United States securities laws prohibit
any Person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information
from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communication of
such information to any other Person under circumstances in which it is
reasonably foreseeable that such Person is likely to purchase or sell such
securities.
