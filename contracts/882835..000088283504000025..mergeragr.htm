otherwise in proper form for  transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay any transfer or  other Taxes required by reason of the
exchange to a Person other than the  registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable  satisfaction of the Company that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.6, each Certificate  shall be deemed as of the Effective Time of
the Merger to represent only the  right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this  Section 3.6(a), the consideration into
which the shares represented by such  Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 3.5(a).

pertaining to the shares represented by  such Certificates and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the  stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares that were issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. If, after  the
Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates are presented to the Surviving 
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
portion  of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.

        (c)  |   Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with
the Exchange Agent that  remains unclaimed by the Holders six (6) months

without any interest thereon. Further,  none of the Purchaser, Merger
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation shall be  liable to any former Holder
for any portion of the Merger Consideration or  interest thereon properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any  applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

any Holder such amounts as are  required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment  under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the  extent that amounts are so withheld,
(i) such withheld amounts shall be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in  respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, and (ii) the  Exchange Agent, the
Purchaser, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as  appropriate) shall
provide to such Holder written notice of the amounts so  deducted or

distribute any Viastar Proceeds, if any, to the Equity Holders. Following the
Closing, the Company shall permit the Shareholder Representative to direct

ten (10) days following receipt by the Company of any Viastar Proceeds, the
Company shall deduct all Viastar Costs and Viastar Liabilities from the
Viastar Proceeds and distribute such net amount of the Viastar Proceeds to an
account designated to the Purchaser by the Shareholder Representative. The

a party to or bound by any Employment Agreement. The Company has provided or
made available to the Purchaser correct and complete copies of each
Employment Agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which any of them is otherwise bound. There is no existing

Section 4.17 _Company Benefit Plans_. Each Company Benefit Plan is identified
on Schedule 4.17, and the Company has provided a correct and complete copy of
each such plan to the Purchaser together with the most recent report filed
with respect to such plan with any Governmental Entity. No Company Benefit
Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and no Company Benefit Plan
is described in Section 413(c) of the Code or Section 3(40) of ERISA. The
terms of each Company Benefit Plan as currently in effect that purports to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and any trust which is a part of
any such Company Benefit Plan are subject to a favorable determination letter
or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and each such plan
has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance
with all applicable Laws (including, ERISA and the Code). The terms of each
other Company Benefit Plan satisfy in all material respects the requirements
of applicable Laws (including, ERISA and the Code), and each such plan has
been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with
all applicable Laws (including, ERISA and the Code). The Company and each
Subsidiary has timely satisfied in all material respects all reporting and
disclosure obligations under applicable Laws (including, ERISA and the Code)
with respect to the Company Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor an
ERISA Affiliate has any liability under any Employee Benefit Plan other than
a Company Benefit Plan. There have been no prohibited transactions (as
described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan which have not been corrected in full or with
respect to which any material Tax or penalty is due. If the benefits under a
Company Benefit Plan are funded through a trust, the fair market value of the
assets of such trust equal or exceed the liabilities of such plan. If the
benefits under a Company Benefit Plan are funded through insurance contracts,
such contracts are in full force and effect and all material premiums have
been paid when due. If benefits under a Company Benefit Plan are funded from
the general assets of the Company or a Subsidiary, the liability for funding
such benefits is shown on the books and records of the Company or the
Subsidiary in accordance with GAAP and any applicable standards of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has made full and timely payment of all material amounts which
are required to be paid as contributions to each Company Benefit Plan. No
Company Benefit Plan provides for benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA
following a termination of employment except as required under Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied in
all material respects with the continuation coverage requirements of Part 6
of Title I of ERISA. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.17, there is no
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with any Person which provides for
any payment to any employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
payment would fail to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
which would exceed the deduction limits under Section 404 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any contractual
obligation to maintain any Company Benefit Plan for any period of time or to
make contributions from its general assets at a fixed rate to such plan
(other than premium payments for an insurance contract which are set on a
year-to-year basis and matching contributions as provided in the Companys
401(k) plan). With respect to the options to purchase mutual fund
shares granted pursuant to the Deferred Option Plan, the Company, or a trust
established by the Company actually owns (free of any Liens) a number of
shares in each such mutual fund sufficient to cover in full the exercise of
all such options without payment of any additional amount by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the purchase by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any additional shares in any such mutual fund, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to
such options other than liabilities which will be accrued for on the Final
Closing Statement.

   

Section 4.18 _Labor Relations_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.18_ , (a)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement, contract or legally binding commitment to any trade
union or employee organization or group in respect of or affecting employees;

any negotiation with any trade union or employee organization; (c) neither

Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (f) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
experienced any material work stoppage; and (g) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is subject of any union organization effort.

   

Section 4.19 _Insurance Policies_. _Schedule 4.19_ contains a correct and
complete list of all insurance policies carried by or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, specifying the insurer, the amount of and
nature of coverage, the risk insured against, the deductible amount (if any)
and the date through which coverage shall continue by virtue of premiums
already paid. All insurance policies and bonds with respect to the business
and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect
and shall be maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries in full force and
effect as they apply to any matter, action or event relating to the Company
or its Subsidiaries occurring through the Closing Date and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has reached or exceeded its policy limits
for any insurance policy in effect at any time during the past five (5)

 The claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, costs, expenses, penalties, fines and judgments of the Shareholder Indemnified Parties described in this Section 10.2 as to which the Shareholder Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are collectively referred to as " _Shareholder Losses_ ". 

   

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedure.

        (a)  |   Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of
notice by a third party  (including any Governmental Entity) of any complaint
or the commencement of any  audit, investigation, action or proceeding with
respect to which such  Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment
from the other Party for  any Purchaser Loss or any Shareholder Loss (as the
case may be) in accordance  with this Article X, such Indemnified Party shall
notify the Purchaser or the  Shareholder Representative, as the case may be
(the " _Indemnifying  Party_ "), promptly following the Indemnified Partys
receipt of  such complaint or of notice of the commencement of such audit,
investigation,  action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so  notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from  liability hereunder with respect to such claim only if, and only
to the extent  that, such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party results
in the forfeiture  by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise
available to the  Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have  the right, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified Party within twenty  (20) days thereafter assuming full
responsibility for any Purchaser Losses or  Shareholder Losses (as the case
may be) (subject to any limitations set forth in  this Article X) resulting
from such audit, investigation, action or proceeding,  to assume the defense
of such audit, investigation, action or proceeding,  including the employment
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified  Party and the payment
of the fees and disbursements of such counsel; provided,  however, that an
Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume the defense  of any audit,
investigation, action or proceeding if (i) such claim, based on  the remedy
being sought, could result in criminal liability of, or equitable  remedies
against, the Indemnified Party; or (ii) the Indemnified Party  reasonably
believes that the interests of the Indemnifying Party and the  Indemnified
Party with respect to such claim are in irreconcilable conflict with  one
another, and as a result, the Indemnifying Party could not adequately 
represent the interests of the Indemnified Party in such claim. In the
event,  however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the
defense of  the audit, investigation, action or proceeding on the terms
provided above or to  employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, in either case  within such twenty (20) day period, or if
the Indemnifying Party is not entitled  to assume the defense of the audit,
investigation, action or proceeding in  accordance with the preceding
sentence, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay  the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Indemnified Party as  incurred; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not  be required to pay the
fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all  Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction in any single audit, investigation,  action or
proceeding. In any audit, investigation, action or proceeding for  which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the 
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action,
shall  have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own
counsel at  such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party  (as the case may be) shall at all times use reasonable
efforts to keep the  Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party (as the case may
be) reasonably apprised  of the status of the defense of any matter the
defense of which it is  maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each
other with respect to the  defense of any such matter.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any
claim or consent to the entry  of any judgment with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder  without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the  Indemnifying Party fails to assume
and maintain the defense of such claim  pursuant to Section 10.3(a) or (ii)
such settlement, compromise or consent  includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnifying Party and its officers,  directors, employees and Affiliates
from all liability arising out of such  claim. An Indemnifying Party may not,
without the prior written consent of the  Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any  judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless  (x) such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of  the Indemnified
Party and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates from  all
liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any admission or 
statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the
Indemnified  Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or
term that in any  manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business
of the Indemnified  Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates.   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to
payment pursuant hereto,  such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of
such claim to the  appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify
the basis for such  claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify
the Indemnifying Party  shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to  such Indemnified Party with respect to any
claim made pursuant to this Section  10.3(c), it being understood that
notices for claims in respect of a breach of a  representation or warranty
must be delivered prior to the expiration of the  survival period for such
representation or warranty under Section 10.4. In the  event the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim,  as promptly as
possible, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying  Party
shall establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, 
litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days 
following the final determination of the merits and amount, if any, of such 
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party in
immediately  available funds an amount equal to such claim as determined
hereunder.   
---|--- 
    
   

Section 10.4 _Claims Period_. The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on the
Closing Date hereof and terminate on the date that is fourteen (14) months
from the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close
of business on the last day of the Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall
have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such
claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such
claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity
hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance
with the terms hereof.

   

Section 10.5 _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim for
indemnification under this Article X for Purchaser Losses unless and until
the aggregate amount of such Purchaser Losses exceeds Three Million Dollars
($3,000,0000) (the _"Purchaser Basket_ "), in which event the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may only claim indemnification for Purchaser
Losses exceeding the Purchaser Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , the Surviving
Obligations and the Surviving Representations shall not be subject to the
Purchaser Basket. The amount of Purchaser Losses otherwise payable to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article X shall be net of (a)
any Tax Benefits actually realized by the Purchaser or the Company directly
as a result of such Purchaser Losses (any such Tax Benefit to be determined
after taking into consideration any Tax effect of the indemnification
payment made to the Purchaser with respect to such Purchaser Loss), (b) any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under insurance policies maintained by the Company prior to the Closing Date
directly resulting from such Purchaser Losses, and (c) any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under any professional
liability insurance policies (whether maintained prior to or on or after the
Closing Date) directly resulting from such Purchaser Losses. No liability
shall attach to the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of any claim if
such claim would not have arisen but for a change in legislation or
accounting policies made after the Closing Date or a change in interpretation
of the Law as determined by a court or pursuant to an administrative rule-
making decision. The sole and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of
all Purchaser Losses shall be the General Escrow Fund.

   

Section 10.6 _Investigations_. The respective representations and warranties
of the Parties contained in this Agreement or any certificate or other
document delivered by any Party at or prior to the Closing and the rights to
indemnification set forth in Article X shall not be deemed waived
or otherwise affected by any investigation made by a Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent the Purchaser has Knowledge on the date hereof
of a breach of a representation and warranty made by the Company, it shall
have waived its right to any claims or indemnification with respect to such

intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all claims either the

by any Party of such Partys rights and obligations hereunder shall be made
except with the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that the
Purchaser shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior written consent
of any other Party, be entitled to assign this Agreement or all or any part

Section 11.4 _Captions_. The titles, captions and table of contents contained

Section 11.5 _Controlling Law; Amendment_. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the
State of Delaware without reference to its choice of law rules. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except by written
agreement of the Parties.

   

Section 11.6 Arbitration; Legal Proceedings.

        (a)  |   Any controversy, claim, or question of interpretation
in dispute between the  Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the breach thereof,  except such as may arise under Section 3.8 of this
Agreement, shall be finally  settled by arbitration in Washington D.C., under
the then effective CPR  Institute for Dispute Resolution Rules for Non-
Administered Arbitration as  modified by this Agreement, and judgment on the
award rendered by the  arbitrators may be entered in any U.S. federal or
state court in the State of  Delaware having jurisdiction. The award rendered
by the arbitrators shall be  final and binding on the Parties and not subject
to further appeal. Such  arbitration can be initiated by written notice by
either Party (the  " _Claimant_ ") to the other Party, which notice shall
identify the  Claimants selected arbitrator. The Party receiving such notice
(the  " _Respondent_ ") shall identify its arbitrator within ten (10) 
Business Days following its receipt of such notice. The arbitrator selected
by  the Claimant and the arbitrator selected by the Respondent shall, within
ten  (10) Business Days of their appointment, select a third neutral
arbitrator. In  the event that they are unable to do so, either Party may
request the American  Arbitration Association to appoint the third neutral
arbitrator. The arbitrators  shall have the authority to award any remedy or
relief that a court in Delaware  could order or grant, including, specific
performance of any obligation created  under this Agreement, the issuance of
injunctive or other provisional relief, or  the imposition of sanctions for
abuse or frustration of the arbitration process.  The arbitration award will
be in writing and, if requested by the Parties,  specify the factual and
legal basis for the award.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   It is the intent of the Parties that any arbitration
shall be concluded as  quickly as reasonably practicable. Unless the Parties
otherwise agree, once  commenced, the hearing on the disputed matters shall
be held four (4) days a  week until concluded with each hearing date to begin
at 9:00 a.m. and to  conclude at 5:00 p.m. The arbitrators shall use all
reasonable efforts to issue  the final award or awards within a period of
five (5) Business Days after  closure of the proceedings. Failure of the
arbitrators to meet the time limits  of this Section 11.6 shall not be a
basis for challenging the award.   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   The arbitrators shall instruct the non-prevailing
Party to pay all costs of the  proceedings, including the fees and expenses
of the arbitrators and the  reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of the
prevailing Party. If the  arbitrators determine that there is not a
prevailing Party, each Party shall be  instructed to bear its own costs and
to pay one-half of the fees and expenses of  the arbitrators.   
---|--- 
    
        (d)  |   Each Party hereto hereby agrees that any legal
proceeding instituted to enforce  an arbitration award hereunder will be
brought in the U.S. federal or state  courts situated in Delaware having
jurisdiction, and hereby submits to personal  jurisdiction therein and
irrevocably waives any objection as to venue therein,  and further agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any such  proceeding has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company hereby  designates, appoints
and empowers The Corporation Trust Company, presently  having offices at
Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington,  Delaware 19801, as
its true and lawful agent for service of process to receive  and accept on
its behalf, on or prior to the Closing Date, service of process in  any such
proceeding brought in any such courts. After the Closing Date, all such 
service of process with respect to the Company or the Shareholder
Representative  shall be made on the Shareholder Representative at the
address specified in  Section 11.1 hereof. The Purchaser hereby designates,
appoints and empowers The  Prentiss Hall Corporation System, Inc., presently
having offices at 2711  Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware
19808, as the Purchasers  true and lawful agent for service of process to
receive and accept on the  Purchasers behalf service of process in any such
proceeding brought in any  such courts. Each of the foregoing Persons agrees
that the failure of the  process agent appointed by such Person to give
notice of process to such Person  shall not impair or affect the validity of
service upon such agent or of any  judgment based thereon, and each such
Person irrevocably consents to the service  of process in any such proceeding
by the mailing of copies thereof by certified  mail, postage prepaid, to such
Persons address for notices under this  Agreement.   
---|--- 
    
   

Section 11.7 _Severability_. Any provision hereof that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of Law that renders
any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

   

Section 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and it shall
not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or the terms hereof to
produce or account for more than one of such counterparts.

   

Section 11.9 _Enforcement of Certain Rights_. Nothing expressed or implied
herein is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give any Person
other than the Parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, any right,
remedy, obligation or liability under or by reason of this Agreement, or
result in such Person being deemed a third-party beneficiary hereof.

   

Section 11.10 _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension
or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of
the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation,
condition, representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of
any other covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or
warranty. A waiver by any Party of the performance of any act shall not
constitute a waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act
required to be performed at a later time.

   

Section 11.11 _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents executed
pursuant hereto supersede all negotiations, agreements and understandings
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (except for that
certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2004, by and between
the Purchaser and the Company) and constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect thereto.

   

Section 11.12 _Cooperation Following the Closing_. Following the Closing,
each Party shall deliver to the other Parties such further information and
documents and shall execute and deliver to the other Parties such further
instruments and agreements as any other Party shall reasonably request to
consummate or confirm the transactions provided for herein, to accomplish
the purpose hereof or to assure to any other Party the benefits hereof.

   

Section 11.13 _Transaction Costs_. Except as provided above or as otherwise
expressly provided herein, (a) the Purchaser shall pay its own fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the fees, costs and expenses of its financial
advisors, accountants and counsel, and (b) the fees, costs and expenses of
the Company incurred in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid for pursuant to Section 3.7(d) of this Agreement if the
Closing occurs and by the Company if the Closing does not occur. The fees and
expenses related to any filing made pursuant to the HSR Act shall be paid 80%
by the Purchaser and 20% by the Company.

   

Section 11.14 Shareholders Representative.

        (a)  |   By the execution and delivery of a Letter of
Transmittal, including counterparts  hereof, each Equity Holder hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints a  committee consisting of a designee of
KRG and John Worthington as the true and  lawful agent and attorney-in-fact
(the " _Shareholder  Representative_ ") of such Equity Holder with full
powers of substitution  to act in the name, place and stead of such Equity
Holder with respect to the  performance on behalf of such Equity Holder under
the terms and provisions  hereof and to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to  execute all such documents, as the
Shareholder Representative shall deem  necessary or appropriate in connection
with any transaction contemplated  hereunder, including the power to:   
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   act for such Equity Holder, if applicable, with
respect to all indemnification  matters referred to herein, including the
right to compromise or settle any such  claim on behalf of such Equity
Holder;   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   act for such Equity Holder with respect to the
General Escrow Amount and the  Intellectual Property Escrow Amount;

        (iii)  |   act for such Equity Holder with respect to the
Viastar Matter and the Viastar  Funding Amount;

        (iv)  |   amend or waive any provision hereof (including any
condition to Closing) in any  manner that does not differentiate among any
Equity Holder;   
---|--- 
    
        (v)  |   employ, obtain and rely upon the advice of legal
counsel, accountants and other  professional advisors as the Shareholder

received on behalf of such  Equity Holder prior to their distribution to such
Equity Holder to the extent of  any amount that the Shareholder
Representative deems necessary for payment of or  as a reserve against
expenses, and pay such expenses or deposit the same in an  interest-bearing
bank account established for such purpose;   
---|--- 
    
        (viii)  |   receive all notices, communications and deliveries

behalf of such Equity Holder  that the Shareholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate, in the sole  discretion of the Shareholder
Representative, relating to the subject matter  hereof as fully and
completely as such Equity Holder could do if personally  present and acting
and as though any reference to such Shareholder herein was a  reference to
the Shareholder Representative.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   The appointment of the Shareholder Representative
shall be deemed coupled with  an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any
other Person may conclusively and  absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any
action of the Shareholder  Representative as the act of each Equity Holder in
all matters referred to  herein.   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   In the event the Shareholder Representative resigns or
ceases to function in  such capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the
successor Shareholder  Representative shall be the Person that KRG and John
W. Worthington appoint.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed, as of the date first above written.
