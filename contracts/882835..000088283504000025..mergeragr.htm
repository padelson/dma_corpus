          ineligible for such appraisal rights. The holders thereof shall be entitled only
          to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of
          Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to
          Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Purchaser in
          accordance with the DGCL; provided, however, that (a) if any such holder of
          Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish entitlement to appraisal rights
          as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, (b) if any such holder of Dissenting
          Shares shall have effectively withdrawn demand for appraisal of such shares or
          lost the right to appraisal and payment for shares under Section 262 of the DGCL
          or (c) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation
          shall have filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all
          Dissenting Shares within the time provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such
          holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such share
          shall be treated as if it had been, as of the Effective Time, converted into a
          right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, without
          interest thereon, as provided in Section 3.5(a) of this Agreement. The Company
          shall give the Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
          for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, and the Purchaser shall have the
          right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
          demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
          Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
          such demands with respect to any holder of Dissenting Shares before the

          the effect that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
          and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
          to the Exchange Agent. Such Letter of Transmittal shall also bind such holder to
          the provisions of Section 11.14 of this Agreement. Upon surrender of a
          Certificate to the Company, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
          executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
          exchange therefor the consideration into which the shares represented by such

          satisfaction of the Company that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
          Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;3.6, each Certificate

most recent report filed with respect to such plan with any Governmental Entity. No
Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and no Company Benefit Plan is
described in Section 413(c) of the Code or Section 3(40) of ERISA. The terms of each
Company Benefit Plan as currently in effect that purports to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and any trust which is a part of any such Company Benefit Plan are
subject to a favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service, and each such plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with all applicable Laws (including, ERISA and the Code). The terms
of each other Company Benefit Plan satisfy in all material respects the requirements of
applicable Laws (including, ERISA and the Code), and each such plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Laws (including,
ERISA and the Code). The Company and each Subsidiary has timely satisfied in all material
respects all reporting and disclosure obligations under applicable Laws (including, ERISA
and the Code) with respect to the Company Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor an ERISA
Affiliate has any liability under any Employee Benefit Plan other than a Company Benefit
Plan. There have been no prohibited transactions (as described in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which have not been
corrected in full or with respect to which any material Tax or penalty is due. If the
benefits under a Company Benefit Plan are funded through a trust, the fair market value of
the assets of such trust equal or exceed the liabilities of such plan. If the benefits
under a Company Benefit Plan are funded through insurance contracts, such contracts are in
full force and effect and all material premiums have been paid when due. If benefits under
a Company Benefit Plan are funded from the general assets of the Company or a Subsidiary,
the liability for funding such benefits is shown on the books and records of the Company
or the Subsidiary in accordance with GAAP and any applicable standards of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made full and
timely payment of all material amounts which are required to be paid as contributions to
each Company Benefit Plan. No Company Benefit Plan provides for benefits described in
Section 3(1) of ERISA following a termination of employment except as required under Part
6 of Title I of ERISA, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied in all
material respects with the continuation coverage requirements of Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.17, there is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement with any Person which provides for any payment to any employee by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, which payment would fail to be deductible by reason of Section
280G of the Code or which would exceed the deduction limits under Section 404 of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any contractual obligation to maintain
any Company Benefit Plan for any period of time or to make contributions from its general
assets at a fixed rate to such plan (other than premium payments for an insurance contract
which are set on a year-to-year basis and matching contributions as provided in the
Company&#146;s 401(k) plan). With respect to the options to purchase mutual fund shares
granted pursuant to the Deferred Option Plan, the Company, or a trust established by the
Company actually owns (free of any Liens) a number of shares in each such mutual fund
sufficient to cover in full the exercise of all such options without payment of any
additional amount by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the purchase by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of any additional shares in any such mutual fund, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to such options other
than liabilities which will be accrued for on the Final Closing Statement. </FONT></P>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Purchaser Indemnified

Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of such Purchaser Losses exceeds Three
Million Dollars ($3,000,0000) (the <U>&#147;Purchaser Basket</U>&#148;), in which event
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may only claim indemnification for Purchaser Losses
exceeding the Purchaser Basket; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, the Surviving Obligations
and the Surviving Representations shall not be subject to the Purchaser Basket. The amount
of Purchaser Losses otherwise payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this Article X shall be net of (a) any Tax Benefits actually realized by the Purchaser or
the Company directly as a result of such Purchaser Losses (any such Tax Benefit to be
determined after taking into consideration any Tax effect of the indemnification payment
made to the Purchaser with respect to such Purchaser Loss), (b) any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under insurance policies maintained
by the Company prior to the Closing Date directly resulting from such Purchaser Losses,
and (c) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under any professional liability insurance policies (whether maintained prior to or on or
after the Closing Date) directly resulting from such Purchaser Losses. No liability shall
attach to the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of any claim if such claim would not
have arisen but for a change in legislation or accounting policies made after the Closing
Date or a change in interpretation of the Law as determined by a court or pursuant to an
administrative rule-making decision. The sole and exclusive source of funds for
