 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _ _Agreement__ "),
dated as of April 7, 2005, among Concord Communications, Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation (the " _ _Company__ "), Computer Associates
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ _Parent__ "), and Minuteman
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _ _Merger Sub__ ," the Company and Merger Sub sometimes being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _ _Constituent Corporations__
").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
with the Company as the surviving entity (the " _ _Merger__ ") and approved
the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease.  The Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to
as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the separate corporate existence
of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in
Article II.  The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as amended (the " _ _MBCA__ ").

  



  

1.2 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York, at 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the first business day
(the " _ _Closing Date__ ") following the day on which the last to be
fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause Articles of Merger (the " _ _Massachusetts
Articles of Merger__ ") to be executed and delivered to the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as provided in Section
11.06 of the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the
Massachusetts Articles of Merger have been filed with the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at such later time as
may be agreed by the parties and specified in the Massachusetts Articles of
Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ ").

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  



  

2.1 _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles
of organization of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical
to the certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub (the " _ _Charter__
"), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law;
provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the articles
of organization of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Concord
Communications, Inc.". After the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of 1,000 shares of common stock,
par value $.01 per share.

  



  

2.2 _The By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company in
effect at the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety
to be identical to the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time(the " _ _By-Laws__ "), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  



  

 _Officers and Directors 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  



  

3.1 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the By-Laws and the Board of Directors of the Company
shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to give effect
to the foregoing.

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

3.2 _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _Conversion of Securities_

  



  

4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder of shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of
Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _ _Company
Common Stock__ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section
4.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled
in accordance with Section 4.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
$17.00 **** in cash per share, without interest (the " _
_Merger Consideration__ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right (other than in respect of
Dissenting Shares) to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 4.1(c) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 4.2, without interest.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent appointed by Parent
and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) (the " _ _Exchange Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for payment through the Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Section 4.2, cash in an amount equal to the product of
the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (exclusive of
any shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) (the " _
_Exchange Fund__ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent provided that such investments shall be in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(c) shall be promptly returned
to Parent.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _ _Certificate__ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form and as approved by the Company and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV, after giving effect to
any required withholding taxes, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, it will be a condition of payment of the
Merger Consideration that the surrendered Certificate be properly endorsed,
with signatures guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the surrendered Certificate or such Person will establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 4.2. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean an
individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
evidencing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article IV.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has
not previously complied with this Section 4.2 shall be entitled to receive
only from Parent payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without
interest.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(h) As used in this Agreement, the term " _ _Business Day__ " means any day
that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the banks in either the
State of New York or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are permitted or

4.3 _Company Options_. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any holder of outstanding options to
purchase Company Common Stock (" _ _Company Stock Options__ "), each Company
Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, and all Company Stock Plans (as
hereinafter defined) themselves, insofar as they relate to
outstanding Company Stock Options, shall be assumed by Parent and each
Company Stock Option shall become an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of common stock, $0.10 par
value per share, of Parent (" _ _Parent Common Stock__ ;" such options, " _
_Parent Stock Options__ ") determined as follows: (i) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Stock Option assumed by
Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock; and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option assumed by
Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.
Any restrictions on the exercise of any Company Stock Option assumed by
Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability,
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Stock Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Company
Stock Option (other than as set forth in any agreement in effect as of the
date of this Agreement). The " _ _Conversion Ratio__ " shall be equal to the
fraction having a numerator equal to $17.00 and having a denominator equal to
the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on The New York Stock Exchange for each of the five (5) consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that
if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate; provided, however, that with respect to any Company Stock
Option which is an "incentive stock option", within the meaning of Section
422 of the

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

Code, the adjustments provided in this Section shall, if applicable, be
modified in a manner so that the adjustments are consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions that are
necessary to accomplish the provisions of Section 4.3(a).

  



  

(c) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the participants in the Company Stock Plans an appropriate
notice setting forth such participants rights pursuant to the Company Stock
Options, as provided in this Section 4.3.

  



  

(d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Company Stock Options assumed in accordance with this
Section.  Within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.

  



  

4.4 _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall terminate its 2001 Non-Executive Employee Stock Purchase Plan
and 2004 Non-Executive Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the "
_Purchase Plans_ ") in accordance with their respective terms. The Company
shall amend each of the Purchase Plans as appropriate to avoid the
commencement of any new offering of options thereunder at or after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time.

  



  

4.5 _Actions by the Company_. Subject to Section 4.3, the Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation will not be bound by any options, rights,
awards or arrangements to which the Company is a party which would entitle
any person, other than Parent or Merger Sub, to beneficially own shares of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent or receive any payments (other than as
set forth in this Section) in respect of such options, rights, awards or
arrangements.

  



  

4.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock the
holder of which has perfected his, her or its right to dissent from the
Merger under the MBCA and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as
of the Effective Time (the " _ _Dissenting Shares__ ") shall not be converted
into, or represent a right to receive, the Merger Consideration hereunder,
and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted
by the applicable provisions of the MBCA. If any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

to dissent, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall thereupon be
treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder would be entitled
pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
upon receipt by the Company of any written demands for payment of the fair
value of shares of Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments provided.  The Company shall not make any payment
or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such
demands unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such
payment or settlement offer.

  



  

4.7 _Restricted Stock_. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that
are issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and that are subject to
vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in restricted stock grant or
similar agreements with the Company (such shares of Company Common Stock
being " _Restricted Shares_ ", and such restricted stock grant or similar
agreements being " _Stock Restriction Agreements_ ") shall remain subject to
the terms and conditions of the applicable Stock Restriction Agreements
without modification notwithstanding the Merger, except as modified by the
terms and conditions of the Management Change in Control Agreement or Amended
and Restated Management Change in Control Agreement to which the holder
of Restricted Shares is a party. From and after the Effective Time, as the
vesting and forfeiture restrictions set forth in any Stock Restriction
Agreement expire or lapse, the holder of the applicable Restricted Shares
shall be entitled to exchange such shares for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the Merger as set forth in Article IV hereof.

the ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so

(c) any adverse change, effect or circumstance proximately caused by the

Effect; and

  



  

(f) a decline in the price of the Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq National
Market; provided, that, the exception in this clause shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a

provided, further, that, with respect to clauses (a), (b) and (d), such
change, event, circumstance or development does not (i) primarily relate only
to (or have the effect of primarily relating only to) the Company and
its Subsidiaries or (ii) disproportionately adversely affect the Company
and its Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size operating in
the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company
ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA in an amount which would be material.  Neither the Company nor any

of the Company, threatened, litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans.
 Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations
for retiree health and life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan or
collective bargaining agreement. By its terms, the Company or its
Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such Company ERISA Plan at any time

incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

  



  

(f) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Section 5.9(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all contracts, plans or
arrangements obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay
severance to any current or former directors, employees, independent
contractors or consultants (including without limitation outsourcing) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for obligations pursuant to,
required by or arising under applicable Law. Except pursuant to retention or
other agreements set forth on Schedule 5.10(a)-2, neither the execution of
this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount

  



  

21   

     
   

  



  

payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Company Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or,

its Subsidiaries.

7.2 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted hereby, during the Pre-Closing Period, neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives (such employees,
agents, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives, collectively, " _ _Representatives__ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or (ii)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in, any discussions or
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data
to any Person for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, an Acquisition
Proposal, or otherwise facilitate knowingly any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _
_Acquisition Proposal__ " shall mean (i) any proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company or (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, over 15% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets
(including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the
Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Meeting (the " _ _Specified
Time__ "), the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request
therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (as defined above, but substituting 50% for 15%, except
in the case of an asset sale, in which case "all or substantially all" shall
be substituted for 15%) that did not result from a breach of this Section
7.2(a) and subject to compliance with Section 7.2(b) if the Company Board
receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

agreement on terms not less restrictive of the other party than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and promptly discloses (and
if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the
extent not previously provided to Parent) or **** (B) engage in or
participate in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made
such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) in each
such case referred to in clause (A) or (B), the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board under applicable Law, and (y) with respect to clause (B) above,
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal (1) if
accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person
making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of
view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more
favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a " _
_Superior Proposal__ ") or (2) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal.

  



  

(b) _Notices to Parent_. The Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise
Parent, orally and in writing, of receipt by the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
provide copies of any such written request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
together with the material terms and conditions thereof (including any
amendment thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and the material terms and conditions
(including any amendment thereto) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry.

  



  

(c) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 or
in Section 7.5 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

  



  

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the
Effective Time or such earlier date as this Agreement may be terminated in
accordance with its terms (the " _ _Pre-Closing Period__ "), the
Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

  



  

(i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.2(d), withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval,
recommendation or

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any committee thereof
with respect to the Company Voting Proposal (it being understood
that publicly taking a neutral position or no position with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification, except
that publicly taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal for a period of time not in excess of ten (10) Business
Days after the first public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall
not be considered an adverse modification (such time period, an " _
_Acquisition Proposal Assessment Period__ ") unless such position continues
beyond the expiration of the Acquisition Proposal Assessment Period);

  



  

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement providing for the consummation of a
transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (an " _ _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement__ "), other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 7.2(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section
7.2(a); or

  



  

(iii) except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.2, approve, recommend
or adopt or propose (publicly or otherwise) to approve, recommend or adopt,
any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the Specified Time, the Company Board may withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify its recommendation with respect to the Company Voting Proposal
or approve or recommend any Superior Proposal made or received after the
date hereof and not solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in breach of
this Agreement, and subject to compliance with Section 7.2(b), if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law (a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Change of Recommendation may be made until
after two (2) Business Days following Parents receipt of written notice from
the Company (an " _ _Adverse Recommendation Notice__ ") advising Parent that
the Company Board intends to make such Change in Recommendation, which
Adverse Recommendation Notice shall contain all information concerning any
Superior Proposal required by Section 7.2(b) (it being understood and agreed
that, in accordance with Section 7.2(b), the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed during such two (2) Business Day period of the status and
material terms and conditions (including any amendment thereto) of any such
Superior Proposal). In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation
in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall take into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to
an Adverse Recommendation Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such
third party Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(e) The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease
immediately any existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

7.3 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company, in cooperation with Parent, shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify Parent promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or
any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 7.3 to comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of Law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate
in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or
mailing to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement.

  



  

7.4 _Nasdaq Quotation_. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to continue the quotation of the Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq
National Market during the term of this Agreement.

  



  

7.5 _Company Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall
take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its articles of
organization and by-laws and the rules of The Nasdaq National Market to
promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_ _Company Meeting__ ") for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
Company Voting Proposal. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article IX, the obligation of the Company to convene and hold the
Company Meeting will not be limited or otherwise affected by a Change of
Recommendation. Subject to Section 7.2, (i) the Company Board will recommend
to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of the Company Voting
Proposal and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) the
Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal.  Subject to
Section 7.2 (but without affecting in any manner the Companys

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

obligations pursuant to Section 7.3), the Company shall take all action that
is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
stockholders of the Company required by the rules of The Nasdaq National
Market or the MBCA to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with
Parent, may adjourn the Company Meeting, but only to the extent necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement)
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Meeting.

  



  

7.6 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) Subject to the terms hereof,
including Section 7.2 and Section 7.6(b), the Company and Parent shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any
Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits,

otherwise reasonably requested by Parent, in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) as promptly as practicable,
make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A)
the Exchange Act and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws,
(B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any
other applicable Law, and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall consult
and cooperate with each other, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with the obtaining of all such consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders, including, without
limitation, (i) keeping the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) providing
copies of written notices or other communications received by such party or
any of its respective Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing
of information, providing copies of any proposed filings to be made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including,
without limitation, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf
of any party hereto) and (iv) if requested, accepting reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company and
Parent shall each use its

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable Law (including all information required to
be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 7.6(a)
shall modify or affect their respective rights and responsibilities under
Section 7.6(b).  The Company shall not permit any of its officers or any
other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting or proceeding
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or
other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with Parent in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives Parent and its outside counsel
the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting or proceeding.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, each of Parent and the Company agree, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign Law, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _ _Antitrust Laws__
"), to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust
Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits
the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision in this Agreement, (i) nothing in this Agreement
shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to
proffer to, or agree to, sell, license, lease, transfer or otherwise encumber
or hold separate and agree to sell, license, lease, transfer or otherwise
encumber before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or
interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, license, lease, transfer or
other encumbrance or agreement to sell, license, lease, transfer or
otherwise encumber by the Company of any of its assets or businesses) or to
agree to any material changes (including, without limitation, through a
licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents
ability to own or operate, the operations of any such assets or businesses or
Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends with respect to or
otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock of the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to take any other
action under this Section 7.6 if the United States Department of Justice or
the United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger.  The Company and Parent will each request early termination of
the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act.

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, (b) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub
or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, or (c) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened
in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

  



  

7.7 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of
information, upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required
by applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and

requested including information relating to Contracts with Governmental
Entities, insurance, pending litigation or claims, employee and employment
matters, Export Control and Classification Numbers for Company Software, and
information regarding Company membership in standards organizations,
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company
(i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 7.7

such condition was applicable in an individuals case in the comparable
predecessor welfare benefit plan and (y) provide credit to Company Employees
for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the
Company and its subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year
including the Effective Time, to the extent such credit was provided under
the comparable Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

7.11 _Company and Parent Benefit Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, if
requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans effective not earlier than the
Effective Time.  Prior to

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan
or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the employee benefit
plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to
provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence to
participate therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation. In
addition, prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, Parent shall cause
to be amended, or take any actions the Parent deems appropriate, the employee
benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent
necessary to provide that no employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall commence to participate therein following the Effective Time unless
Parent or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation. Nothing
contained in this Section 7.11 shall diminish the undertakings of the
respective parties set out in Section 7.10.

  



  

7.12 _Loans to Company Employees, Officers and Directors_. Prior to the
Effective Time, all loans (other than travel advances, payroll advances and
other advances made in the ordinary course of business, which in each case do
not exceed $1,000, and the relocation loans set forth in Section 7.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
of their employees, officers or directors shall be no longer outstanding.

  



  

7.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From the
Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _
_Costs__ "), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the MBCA for officers and
directors of Massachusetts corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; provided, that, any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, to the extent required by the MBCA to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

  



  

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, and Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions as favorable as can be
obtained in comparison to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the articles of
organization and by-laws of the Company.

  



  

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense
to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time
the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of
250% of the annual premium paid by the Company in its most recent fiscal
year, which premium is set forth in Section 7.13(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (250% of such annual premium, the " _ _Maximum Premium__ "). If the
Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such
six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as
much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions as favorable as can be obtained in
comparison to the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance. The provisions of this Section 7.13(c) shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if Parent, with the cooperation of the Company, obtains
prepaid policies prior to the Closing for purposes of this Section
7.13, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage no
less advantageous to the insured for an aggregate period of six (6) years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time (including those related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

(d) If Parent fails to comply with its obligations under this Section 7.13,
and, in order to enforce an Indemnified Partys rights under this Section
7.13, an Indemnified Party commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Parent that Parent breached its obligations under this Section 7.13,
Parent shall pay to the Indemnified Party its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit after delivery to Parent of reasonable documentation
evidencing such costs and expenses.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.13 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives in accordance with Section 10.8 hereof.

  



  

7.14 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
or regulation on such transactions.

  



  

7.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_.

  



  

(a) The Board of Directors of the Parent, or a committee thereof consisting
of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the
Effective Time providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent
Stock Options upon substitution of Company Stock Options, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such
securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, is intended to be exempt
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) The Company shall provide the Section 16 Information to the Parent at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Section 16 Information" means information regarding the Company
Insiders and the number of shares of Company Common Stock or other Company
equity securities deemed to be beneficially owned by each such Company
Insider and expected to be exchanged for options to purchase Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Merger.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Insiders" means those officers
and directors of the Company who immediately after the Closing become subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to equity securities of the Buyer.

Superior Proposal), and (B) Parent did not make, within three (3)
Business Days after its receipt of such written notification (the " _

beyond the Acquisition Proposal Assessment Period shall be considered an
adverse modification, and it being further understood and agreed that for
purposes of this Agreement a factually accurate public statement by the
Company that does no more than describe the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a withdrawal, qualification or
modification, or proposal by the Company Board to withdraw, qualify or modify
the Company Boards recommendation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder, or an approval or

  



  

51

9.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article
IX, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 10.1) shall become
void and of no effect with no liability or obligation on the part of any
party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal

any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful
or intentional breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company agrees to pay Parent a fee in immediately available funds of
$11.5 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and shall pay all of the charges

respect to any termination pursuant to Section 9.2(a), the date of such
termination and, with respect to any termination pursuant to Section 9.2(b),
the seventh (7th) Business Day prior to the date of the Company

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

Meeting and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement) to consummate, or shall
have consummated or shall have approved or recommended to the Companys
stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal; provided,
that, for purposes of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall not be
deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by any Person if, within twelve (12)
months of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than
a confidentiality agreement) to consummate, or shall have consummated,
an Acquisition Proposal made by or on behalf of such Person or any of
its Affiliates,

  



  

(ii) by the Company (A) pursuant to Section 9.2(b) and, prior to the date of

failure to oppose an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal, in the case of clause (i) above; (y) on the date of
termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (ii) above; and (z) two
(2) Business Days after termination of this Agreement in the case of clause

Days after demand therefore and delivery to the Company of reasonable
documentation therefor following the occurrence of the termination event
giving rise to the Termination Fee payment obligation described in this
Section 9.5(b). Payment of the Termination Fee and Expenses shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this Agreement described
in paragraph (b) of Section 9.4, but is otherwise the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties in connection with any termination of this Agreement.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.5(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay both the Termination Fee and
Expenses in accordance with this Section 9.5(b) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, the
Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee
and/or Expenses, from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made, after delivery to the Company of reasonable
documentation evidencing such costs and expenses.

deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a

the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

10.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

10.12 _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof.  Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  Whenever the words "include,"

be followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

10.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation.  Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement is void.
