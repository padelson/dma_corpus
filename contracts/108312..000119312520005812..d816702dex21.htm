in number as possible. The number of directors which constitutes the whole Board of Directors must not be less than six (6), the exact number of directors and the exact number of directors in each class to be determined from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Directors. At each annual meeting, successors to the class of directors whose term expired at that annual meeting are elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors has changed, any increase or decrease must be
apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class holds office for a term
that coincides with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director holds office until the annual meeting of stockholders for the year in which his or
her term expires and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more
classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Corporation, if any, have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and
other features of such directorships is governed by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected will not be divided into classes pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.1 unless expressly provided by such
terms. </P>

provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws is effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent is revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent is deemed revoked if (i)&nbsp;the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2)&nbsp;consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and
(ii)&nbsp;such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability
as a revocation will not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this section is deemed given: (i)&nbsp;if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
(ii)&nbsp;if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii)&nbsp;if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such
specific posting, upon the later of (a)&nbsp;such posting and (b)&nbsp;the giving of such separate notice; and (iv)&nbsp;if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or of the transfer agent or the agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission is, in the absence of fraud, prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of these Bylaws,
&#147;electronic transmission&#148; means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly
reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;7.3 <U>Notice to Stockholders Sharing an

Corporation is effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom notice is given. Any consent is revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the
Corporation. A stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within sixty (60)&nbsp;days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice will be deemed to have consented to receiving
the single notice. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;7.4 <U>Waiver</U> </P>

waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, is deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of that meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of,
any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation.
