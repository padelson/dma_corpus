1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Hexcel Common Stock and Merger Sub Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Hexcel, Woodward, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of Hexcel,
Woodward or Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Entity, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares
so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Entity. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Entity into which such shares of Merger Sub Common Stock were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, each share of Hexcel Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
shares of Hexcel Common Stock that are owned by Woodward, Hexcel or Merger Sub
(in each case other than shares of Hexcel Common Stock held in trust accounts,
managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary
or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties) (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.6250
shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ", and such shares, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") of Woodward Common Stock.

(c) All of the shares of Hexcel Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE I_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_
," it being understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Hexcel Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Hexcel Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) a New Certificate representing the number of whole shares
of Woodward Common Stock which such shares of Hexcel Common Stock have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_,
(ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Hexcel Common
Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_,
without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_,
in each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Hexcel Common Stock or Woodward Common Stock shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or reverse
stock split, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio
to give Woodward and the holders of shares of Hexcel Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to
permit Hexcel or Woodward to take any action with respect to its securities or
otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



-3- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all Cancelled Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no Woodward Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

 

1.6 _Treatment of Hexcel Equity Awards_

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Hexcel Common
Stock (a " _Hexcel Stock Option_ ") that, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, is outstanding and unexercised shall be converted into an
option to purchase shares of Woodward Common Stock (an " _Assumed Option_ ")
having the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Hexcel
Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any extended post-termination exercise period that applies
following consummation of the Merger), except that (i) all Assumed Options
corresponding to Hexcel Stock Options that are outstanding on the date of this
Agreement shall be fully vested, (ii) the number of shares of Woodward Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) subject to the Assumed Option
will be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Hexcel Common
Stock subject to the corresponding Hexcel Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (iii) the exercise
price per share of Woodward Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) subject to the Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of Hexcel Common Stock of such corresponding Hexcel
Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the
Exchange Ratio, and (iv) all references to the "Company" in Hexcels 2013
Incentive Stock Plan or 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as applicable (the "
_Hexcel Stock Plan_ "), and the Hexcel Stock Option agreements will be
references to Woodward.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award (or portion
thereof) covering shares of Hexcel Common Stock that does not provide for
performance-based vesting (a " _Hexcel RSU Award_ ") and that, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is outstanding and vested (or
otherwise will vest in accordance with its terms as a result of
the occurrence of the Merger) (a " _Hexcel Vested RSU Award_ "), but
excluding any Hexcel Vested RSU Award the settlement of which is deferred
beyond the vesting date pursuant to the applicable award agreement or any
deferral election (a " _Hexcel Vested/Deferred RSU Award_ "), shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, a number of shares of Woodward Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Hexcel Common Stock covered by such Hexcel Vested RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, subject to any applicable withholding Taxes. For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, vesting based on continued
employment or other service shall not be considered a performance-based
vesting provision.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Hexcel RSU Award (or portion thereof) that,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is outstanding and is not a
Hexcel Vested RSU Award (a " _Hexcel Unvested RSU Award_ ") and each Hexcel
Vested/Deferred RSU Award (any such Hexcel Unvested RSU Award or Hexcel
Vested/Deferred RSU Award, a " _Hexcel Rollover RSU Award_ "), by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be
assumed by Woodward and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a
restricted stock unit award covering Woodward Common Stock (an " _Assumed RSU
Award_ ") having the same

 



-4- 

    

 terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Hexcel Rollover RSU
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each
Assumed RSU Award will cover that number of shares of Woodward Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (a) the number of
shares of Hexcel Common Stock that were subject to the Hexcel Rollover RSU
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (b) the
Exchange Ratio, and (ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable
Hexcel Stock Plan and Hexcel Rollover RSU Award agreements will be references
to Woodward .

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award (or portion
thereof) covering shares of Hexcel Common Stock that provides for
performance-based vesting (" _Hexcel PSU Award_ ") and that is outstanding
both on the date of this Agreement and immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a " _Hexcel Single Trigger PSU Award_ ") shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, a number of shares of Woodward Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Hexcel
Common Stock covered by such Hexcel Single Trigger PSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time based on the greater of (A) actual performance and
(B) performance at target, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, subject to
any applicable withholding Taxes; provided, however, that for any Hexcel
Single Trigger PSU Award that constitutes deferred compensation within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such award shall be settled on the first
date that will not result in the imposition of any tax under Section 409A of
the Code in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. For
purposes of clause (i)(A) of the immediately preceding sentence, actual
performance shall mean actual performance as determined in the good faith
discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Hexcel Board of Directors on a
date no earlier than ten days, and no later than one day, prior to the
Effective Time, taking into account any necessary or appropriate adjustments
to the applicable performance goals to reflect the shortened performance
periods.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each Hexcel PSU Award (or portion thereof) that,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is outstanding and that is not
a Hexcel Single Trigger PSU Award (a " _Hexcel Rollover PSU Award_ "), by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, shall be assumed by Woodward and converted automatically at the
Effective Time into an Assumed RSU Award having the same terms and conditions
as applied to the corresponding Hexcel Rollover PSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Assumed RSU Award will
cover that number of shares of Woodward Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of unvested shares of
Hexcel Common Stock that were subject to the Hexcel Rollover PSU Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time assuming performance at target,
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) all references to the "Company" in
the applicable Hexcel Stock Plan and Hexcel Rollover PSU Award agreements will
be references to Woodward, and (iii) the Assumed RSU Award will no longer be
subject to performance-based vesting and will only be subject to service-based
vesting.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Hexcel, the Board of Directors of Hexcel
and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_.

 



-5- 

    

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the application of
_ Sections 1.6(a)_ through _1.6(e)_ is subject to the Laws of a non-U.S.
jurisdiction, then, to the extent that the manner in which such equity award
would otherwise be treated pursuant to this Agreement would result in
materially adverse Tax consequence to the individual holding such equity
award, Hexcel and Woodward shall work in good faith to adjust the treatment of
such equity award as commercially reasonable to avoid such adverse Tax
consequence in such a manner as to yield to the holder of such equity award
the economic benefit intended by _Sections 1.6(a)_ through _1.6(e)_.

 

(h) Woodward shall take all corporate actions that are necessary for the
assumption of the Hexcel Equity Awards pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Woodward Common Stock as
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.6_. In addition, Woodward shall file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the
Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8 (or such other applicable
form) with respect to the Assumed Options, Assumed RSU Awards and Assumed PSU
Awards and the shares of Woodward Common Stock underlying such awards, and
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long
as such awards remain outstanding and such registration of the shares of
Woodward Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Certain Woodward Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Woodward
Common Stock (a " _Woodward Stock Option_ ") and each restricted stock unit
covering shares of Woodward Common Stock (a " _Woodward RSU_ ," and any such
Woodward RSU or Woodward Stock Option, a " _Woodward Equity Award_ "), in each
case that is (i) outstanding (and, in the case of Woodward Stock Options,
unexercised) both (A) as of the date of this Agreement and (B) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) held by an employee of
Woodward or any of its Subsidiaries, but excluding (x) any Woodward Equity
Award that, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is held by the
individual who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is the Chief
Executive Officer of Woodward, and (y) any Woodward Equity Award that, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (I) is held by an employee of
Woodward or any of its Subsidiaries and (II) qualifies for post-termination
continued vesting pursuant to the terms of the applicable Woodward Equity
Award agreement, shall be deemed amended to provide that upon a termination of
such employees employment without "Cause" (as such term is defined in
Woodwards Amended and Restated Executive Change-in-Control Severance
Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.25 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
November 12, 2014 (a " _Woodward Severance Agreement_ ")) or a termination of
employment by such employee for "Good Reason" (as such term is defined in the
Woodward Severance Agreement), in either event, that occurs upon or within
twenty-four (24) months following the Effective Time, such Woodward Equity
Award will become fully vested, and in the case of Woodward Stock Options,
fully exercisable (a " _Woodward Double Trigger Vesting_ ").

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each award granted under the Woodward Cash Long-
Term Incentive Plan (the " _Woodward Cash LTI Plan_ "") that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Woodward Cash LTI Award_
"), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, shall be terminated and converted into the right to receive,

 



-6- 

    

 as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (or such later date
as may be required by the Woodward Cash LTI Plan), without interest, and
subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, a cash amount determined as the
greater of (i) the target award payable in respect of such Woodward Cash LTI
Award, and (ii) the portion of the award payable based on the actual, then
current interim performance payout levels as determined in the good faith
discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Woodward Board (or the
Woodward Board or another authorized committee of the Board) based on
calculations by the applicable Woodward compensation consultant, in accordance
with the methodologies historically applied thereto in calculating interim
performance payout levels for Woodward Cash LTI Awards, with such
determination to be made on a date no earlier than ten days, and no later than
one day, prior to the Effective Time, provided that such amount shall be
prorated based on the portion of the 3-year performance cycle that is
completed using the quotient of (A) the number of completed months (including
for any completed partial months, rounded down to the nearest tenth of a
month) in such cycle, divided by (B) 36.

 

1.8 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Hexcel shall take all necessary action
to terminate the Hexcel ESPP and all outstanding rights thereunder (including

the Hexcel ESPP is permitted to purchase shall not be increased. Unless
otherwise agreed to by Hexcel and Woodward, the Final Offering Period shall
terminate no later than as of the exercise date immediately following the
date of this Agreement, and in all cases no later than the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time. __

approval of the Charter Amendment by the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Woodward Common Stock (the " _Charter Amendment Vote_ ")
and the occurrence of the Closing, Woodward shall cause the Certificate

"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be amended and
restated in their entirety to be in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the "

Combined Company from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

 

1.10 _Bylaws of the Combined Company_. Subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, Woodward shall cause the Bylaws of Woodward (the " _Woodward Bylaws_
"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be amended as set

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Woodward to Make Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Woodward shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
a bank or trust company designated by Woodward and reasonably acceptable to
Hexcel (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in accordance with this
_ARTICLE II_ for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, certificates
or, at Woodwards option, evidence in book-entry form, representing shares of
Woodward Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ (referred
to herein as " _New Certificates_ "), and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ (such cash and New
Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect to
shares of Woodward Common Stock payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than ten (10) days thereafter, Woodward shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing
shares of Hexcel Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Woodward
Common Stock pursuant to _ARTICLE I_ , a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify

 



-8- 

    

 that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates representing the number
of whole shares of Woodward Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which the shares of Hexcel Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions
to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_. Upon proper surrender of an
Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Woodward Common Stock
to which such holder of shares of Hexcel Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of  _ARTICLE I_ and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ and
(y) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or
distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Woodward Common Stock
which the shares of Hexcel Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Woodward
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance
with this _ARTICLE II_. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in
accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the
whole shares of Woodward Common Stock that the shares of Hexcel Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Woodward Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Woodward Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Hexcel of the shares of Hexcel Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding

 



-9- 

    

 immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates
representing shares of Woodward Common Stock as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Woodward Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Woodward Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of the Combined Company. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, the Combined Company shall pay to each former holder of
shares of Hexcel Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Woodward Common
Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the " _Nasdaq_ ") as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days
ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share
(after taking into account all shares of Hexcel Common Stock held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Woodward Common Stock which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.5_. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu
of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration,
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Hexcel for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Combined Company. Any former holders of shares of Hexcel Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Combined Company for payment of the shares of
Woodward Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Woodward Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each former share of Hexcel Common Stock such holder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Hexcel, Woodward, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Entity, the Combined Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Hexcel Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(g) Each of Hexcel, Woodward, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the
Combined Company, and any other person that has any withholding obligation
with respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold,
from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate governmental authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



-10- 

    

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Woodward, the Combined Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as Woodward, the Combined Company or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the shares of Woodward Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(i) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall
be available to holders of shares of Hexcel Common Stock or Woodward Common
Stock in connection with the Merger.

not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Woodward. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Hexcel, Woodward, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Entity or the Combined Company, as the case may be, any
effect, change, event, circumstance, condition,

Person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A)

with officers and employees, financing sources, customers, suppliers, vendors,

representation or warranty is to address the consequences resulting from the
execution of or performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), (E) a decline in the trading price of a
partys common stock or any change in the credit ratings or ratings outlook
for, or the availability or cost of equity, debt or other financing to, such

(A) the execution and delivery by Woodward or Merger Sub of this Agreement or
(B) the consummation by Merger Sub of the Merger and by Woodward and Merger
Sub of the other transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof,
Woodward is not aware of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and
consents will not be received by Woodward or Merger Sub to permit consummation

of Woodward, there is no fact or circumstance existing that would require or
reasonably be expected to require either party to invoke their right to change

transactions. Since September 30, 2016, no independent public accounting firm
of Woodward has resigned (or informed Woodward that it intends to resign) or
been dismissed as independent public accountants of Woodward as a result of
or in connection with any disagreements with Woodward on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing

-16- 

    

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Woodward, neither Woodward nor any Woodward Subsidiary has any liability of
any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Woodward
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September

Woodward Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto
and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Woodward. Woodward
(x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating to
Woodward, including the Woodward Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Woodward by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to

reasonably likely to adversely affect Woodwards ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Woodwards internal controls over financial reporting.
These disclosures were made in writing by management to Woodwards auditors
and audit committee. There is no reason to believe that Woodwards outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals)
of Woodward or any Woodward Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Woodward or any Woodward Subsidiary has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee of or attorney
representing Woodward or any Woodward Subsidiary, whether or not employed by
Woodward or any

 



-17- 

    

 Woodward Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material violation of

any Woodward Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors,

business) or any participants of such Woodward Qualified Plans, including
without limitation pursuant to any investment Contracts with respect to a
Woodward Qualified Plan.

(c) With respect to any Woodward Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
to which Woodward, the Woodward Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Woodward ERISA Affiliates has any liability or contributes: (i) no liability
under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred that has not been satisfied in
full and no condition exists that is likely to cause Woodward, any Woodward

Multiemployer Plan has been established, operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all

been fully reflected on the books and records of Woodward.

 

(g) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for

exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the

to the Woodward Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of
the Woodward Benefit Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of Woodward or any Woodward Subsidiary to the PBGC, the
IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in
a Woodward Benefit Plan, or any other party.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, or accelerate the
timing of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee,
officer, director or other service provider of Woodward or any Woodward
Subsidiary.

(i) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 3.10(h)_, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of

be included as a prospectus. Hexcel and Woodward shall each use reasonable
best efforts to make such filings within forty-five (45) days after the date

efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as

 to their respective stockholders. Woodward shall also use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and Hexcel shall furnish all information concerning Hexcel and
the holders of shares of Hexcel Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all necessary
actions, and do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the date hereof; (ii) make, or
cause to be made, the registrations, declarations and filings (A) required
under the HSR Act and (B) required or advisable in connection with obtaining
the other Requisite Regulatory Approvals, including if agreed upon by Hexcel
and Woodward, appropriate filings and notifications to the European
Commissions Directorate-General for Competition, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in the case of any filings
required under the HSR Act, no later than ten (10) business days after the
date of this Agreement); (iii) prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, clearances and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are

Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities and (iv) seek to avoid or prevent the initiation of any
investigation, claim, action, suit, arbitration, litigation or proceeding by
or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in
this Agreement, the term " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
and all regulatory authorizations, consents, clearances, orders and approvals
set forth on Section 6.1(b) of the Woodward Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objection
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in furtherance of the parties reasonable best efforts, each of
Hexcel and the Hexcel Subsidiaries and Woodward and the Woodward
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent required in order to obtain the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals or any necessary approvals of any other
Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as reasonably practicable or to avoid the consequences in _Section_
__ _ 6.1(b)(iv)_ or otherwise in connection with the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals required pursuant to any Competition Law, shall (i) propose,
negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any sale, leasing,
licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other encumbrance, or holding
separate, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein (collectively, a " _Divestiture_ "); and (ii)
take or agree to take any other action, agree or consent to, make any
concession in respect of, or permit or suffer to exist any condition or
requirement setting forth, any limitations or restrictions on freedom of
actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein (collectively, a " _Remedy_ "), _provided_ that neither party nor its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any of the actions referred to above
with respect to a Divestiture or Remedy unless the effectiveness thereof is
conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, and provided, further,

 



-60- 

    

 that nothing shall require either party to, and neither party shall without
the consent of the other party, agree or consent to a Divestiture or Remedy
that would result in or would reasonably be expected to result in a material
adverse effect on the business of the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger. Hexcel and Woodward agree
to use reasonable best efforts to: (1) oppose or defend against any
investigation, claim, action, suit, arbitration, litigation or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or
(2) overturn any regulatory order by any such Governmental Entity to
prevent consummation of the Merger, including by defending any investigation,
claim, action, suit, arbitration, litigation or proceeding brought by any such
Governmental Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
overturned, terminated or appealed any order that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger.

(d) If Hexcel or Woodward or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates receives a request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, then such party shall make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law), an appropriate response in substantial
compliance with such request. If Hexcel or Woodward receives a formal request
for additional information or documentary material from the Federal Trade
Commission (" _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (" _Antitrust Division_ "), then Hexcel and Woodward will
substantially comply with such formal request as soon as reasonably
practicable, unless otherwise agreed between Hexcel and Woodward. Hexcel and
Woodward shall consult with each other in good faith prior to agreeing,
directly or indirectly, to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
other applicable Law or to any timing agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity.

 

(e) Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it
or any of its affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, furnish the other party promptly with all
communications received from any Governmental Entity and permit the other
party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the other partys
comments to, any proposed communication, filing or submission by such party to
any Governmental Entity. The parties will coordinate and reasonably cooperate
with each other in exchanging information and providing reasonable assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in writing in connection with the
foregoing or in connection with any filing or submission to be made to any
Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that materials exchanged
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ may be redacted or withheld as necessary
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to remove
references concerning the valuation of Hexcels or Woodwards consideration
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other competitively
sensitive material; _provided_ , _further_ that the parties hereto may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any materials provided to the
other pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the party providing such materials. Hexcel and Woodward shall (to
the extent permitted under applicable Law) consult with the other party in
advance of any meeting, discussion or teleconference with any Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with any other person,

 



-61- 

    

 and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Entity or such other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings, discussions and teleconferences. The parties shall discuss in
advance the strategy and timing for obtaining any clearances required or
advisable under any applicable Law in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Hexcel shall not, and shall cause the Hexcel Subsidiaries not to, and
Woodward shall not, and shall cause the Woodward Subsidiaries not to, acquire
or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing part or all of the assets of or equity of, in any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or take any other similar action, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation, or the taking of any other similar action, would
reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, clearances or approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase, in any material
respect, the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the
risk, in any material respect, of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise; or (iv) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) Hexcel and Woodward shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Hexcel,
Woodward or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_ _; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each of Hexcel and
Woodward, for the purposes of performing its respective obligations under
this Agreement and enforcing its respective rights under this Agreement,
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
Representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and, during such period, each of Hexcel and Woodward shall, and
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
party may reasonably request. Neither Hexcel nor Woodward nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 



-62- 

    

(b) Each of Hexcel and Woodward shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
Representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated September 1, 2019, between Hexcel and
Woodward (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Woodward or Merger Sub, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Hexcel or the
Hexcel Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Hexcel, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Woodward or the Woodward Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Woodward, Merger Sub and
Hexcel shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

6.3 _Stockholders_ _Meetings_.

 

(a) Each of Hexcel and Woodward shall call a meeting of its stockholders (the
" _Hexcel Meeting_ " and the " _Woodward Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held
as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the
purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite Woodward Vote, the Charter Amendment
Vote and the Requisite Hexcel Vote required in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger and (b) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in
connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, and each of Hexcel and Woodward shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such meetings to occur on the same date. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, each of Hexcel and Woodward and their respective
Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
stockholders of Hexcel and Woodward, as applicable, the Requisite Hexcel Vote,
the Requisite Woodward Vote and the Charter Amendment Vote, as applicable,
including by communicating to the respective stockholders of Hexcel and
Woodward the Hexcel Board Recommendation and the Woodward Board
Recommendation, respectively (and including the respective recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement), and each of Hexcel and Woodward and their
respective Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the Hexcel Board
Recommendation, in the case of Hexcel, or the Woodward Board Recommendation,
in the case of Woodward, (ii) fail to make the Hexcel Board Recommendation, in
the case of Hexcel, or the Woodward Board Recommendation, in the case of
Woodward, in the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or
endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt,
approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly
and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or
(B) reaffirm the Hexcel Board Recommendation, in the case of Hexcel, or the
Woodward Board Recommendation, in the case of Woodward, in each case within
ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior that
date that is two (2) business days prior to the Hexcel Meeting or the Woodward
Meeting, as applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public (upon a
request by the other party to do so), or (v) publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing (any of the foregoing a " _Recommendation Change_ ").

 



-63- 

    

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, if the Board of Directors of Hexcel or Woodward, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that taking
such action would be required to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, such Board of Directors may, in the case of Hexcel, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite Hexcel Vote, and in the case of Woodward, prior
to the receipt of the Requisite Woodward Vote, make a Recommendation Change
and submit this Agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (although
the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event such Board of Directors may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by Law; _provided_ that such Board of Directors may not take
any actions under this sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least
five (5) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise
to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action
is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice
period, takes into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that taking such action would nevertheless
be required to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. No
Recommendation Change may be made with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if
such Acquisition Proposal was solicited in violation of _Section_ __ _ 6.13_.
Any change in the economic terms of or any other material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ (except that the notice period
shall be shortened to three (3) business days).

(c) Except as required by Law or as Hexcel and Woodward may mutually agree,
neither Hexcel nor Woodward shall adjourn or postpone the Hexcel Meeting or
the Woodward Meeting beyond the date on which the Hexcel Meeting or the
Woodward Meeting, as the case may be, was (or was required to be) originally
scheduled; _provided_ that Hexcel and Woodward shall:

(i) be permitted to adjourn or postpone its own stockholder meeting ( _i.e._
, the Hexcel Meeting or the Woodward Meeting, as the case may be), if (A) as
of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Hexcel Common Stock or Woodward Common Stock, as the
case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, (B) in the case of the
Hexcel Meeting, the Board of Directors of Hexcel has made a Recommendation
Change and, in the case of the Woodward Meeting, Board of Directors of
Woodward has made a Recommendation Change, or (C) a change to the method or
structure of effecting the combination of Hexcel and Woodward is to
be effected pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15_, _provided_ , _further_ , that
in no event shall Hexcel or Woodward adjourn or postpone the Hexcel Meeting or
the Woodward Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this clause (i) more than
two (2) times and by more than forty-five (45) calendar days in the aggregate
with respect to all such adjournments or proposals; and

 



-64- 

    

(ii) at Hexcels request, cause to be adjourned or postponed the Woodward
Meeting, or at Woodwards request, cause to be adjourned or postponed the
Hexcel Meeting, if (A) the Board of Directors of the non-requesting party has
made a Recommendation Change or (B) a change to the method or structure of
effecting the combination of Hexcel and Woodward is to be effected pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_, _provided_ , further, that in no event shall Hexcel or
Woodward be obligated to adjourn or postpone the Hexcel Meeting or the
Woodward Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this clause (ii) more than two
(2) times and by more than forty-five (45) calendar days, in the aggregate
with respect to all such adjournments or proposals;

_provided, however_ , that, if either the Hexcel Meeting or the Woodward
Meeting, as the case may be, is adjourned or postponed pursuant to either the
foregoing clause (i) or (ii), the other of the Hexcel Meeting or the Woodward
Meeting, as the case may be, may be correspondingly adjourned or postponed and
such adjournment or postponement shall not affect the aggregate time limits
contemplated by the foregoing clause (i) or (ii) _._ _ ___

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the Hexcel Meeting shall
be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption by the
stockholders of Hexcel at the Hexcel Meeting and (y) the Woodward Meeting
shall be convened and the Share Issuance and Charter Amendment shall be
submitted to the stockholders of Woodward at the Woodward Meeting, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Hexcel or Woodward of such
obligation.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section_ __ _
6.1_ of this Agreement, each of Hexcel and Woodward shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Hexcel or Woodward or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_ _and Delisting_. Woodward shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Woodward Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq or the NYSE (as
the parties mutually agree), subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
the Effective Time. Hexcel and Woodward shall cooperate in good faith to
obtain the ticker symbol of "WXL" for the Combined Company from and after the
Closing. Hexcel shall cooperate with Woodward and use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Entity of the shares of Hexcel Common Stock from the NYSE and the
deregistration of the shares of Hexcel Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 



-65- 

    

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Hexcel and Woodward acknowledge and agree that (i) for purposes of the
Woodward Amended and Restated Executive Change-in-Control Severance Agreements
(or substantially similarly titled agreement) entered into with certain
employees of Woodward or any Woodward Subsidiaries, the completion of the
transactions contemplated herein will constitute a "Change in Control" as
defined therein, and (ii) for purposes of the Hexcel Benefit Plans listed on
Section 6.6(a) of the Hexcel Disclosure Schedule, the completion of the
transactions contemplated herein will constitute a "Change in Control" or
similar term.

(b) The Combined Company agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all
Hexcel Benefit Plans and Woodward Benefit Plans (subject to _Section_ __ _
6.6(d)_). In order to further an orderly transition and integration, Hexcel
and Woodward shall cooperate in good faith in reviewing, evaluating and
analyzing the Hexcel Benefit Plans and Woodward Benefit Plans with a view
towards developing appropriate new benefit plans, or selecting the Hexcel
Benefit Plans or Woodward Benefit Plans, as applicable, that will apply with
respect to employees of the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), and the Combined
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the New
Benefit Plans, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to (i) treat
similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities, and (ii) not discriminate between employees who
were covered by Hexcel Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by
Woodward Benefit Plans, on the other hand, at the Effective Time. Until such
time as the New Benefit Plans are determined and/or established, the legacy
Woodward employees will participate in Woodward Benefit Plans and the legacy
Hexcel employees will participate in Hexcel Benefit Plans in accordance with
their applicable terms including eligibility, in each case while employed by
the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries and subject to the terms of such
plans, and it is understood and agreed that participation in New Benefit Plans
may commence on different dates following the Effective Time for different
plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Effective Time the Combined
Company or its Subsidiaries shall provide to each legacy Hexcel employee and
Woodward employee, at least the same annual base salary or wage rate, during
the portion of the one year period immediately following the Effective Time
that each such employee remains employed by the Combined Company or its
Subsidiaries and severance benefits and protections in the event of an
applicable qualifying termination that occurs during the one year period
immediately following the Effective Time, in each case, that were in effect
for such employee of Hexcel or Woodward, as applicable, or their respective
Subsidiaries, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to any New Benefit Plans in which any employees of Hexcel or
Woodward (or their respective Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, the Combined
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Benefit Plans in which such employees first
become eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent
such preexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under
the analogous Hexcel Benefit Plan or Woodward Benefit Plan, as the case
may be, (ii) provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents
with credit for any co-payments

 



-66- 

    

 and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, prior to the
time such employee commenced participation in the New Benefit Plan) under a
Hexcel Benefit Plan or Woodward Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Hexcel Benefit Plan or Woodward Benefit
Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any New Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with Hexcel or Woodward, as applicable, and their respective
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities), for all purposes in any New
Benefit Plan in which such employees first become eligible to participate
after the Effective Time to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous Hexcel Benefit Plan or Woodward Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall
not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of service, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan, (C) for purposes of any benefit plan that
provides retiree welfare benefits, or (D) to any benefit plan that is a
frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Hexcel or Woodward or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Entity, the Combined Company, Woodward, Hexcel or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Entity, the Combined Company, Woodward, Hexcel or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any
employee, officer, director or consultant of Hexcel or Woodward or any of
their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Woodward Benefit Plan, Hexcel Benefit Plan, New Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Woodward or any Woodward
Subsidiary (or, after the Effective Time, the Combined Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or their respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Woodward Benefit Plan, Hexcel Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director
or consultant of Hexcel or Woodward or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Certain Tax Matters_. (i) Hexcel shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the tax
opinion referenced in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and (ii) each of Hexcel,
Woodward and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to execute and deliver a customary
tax representation letter that includes the representations referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ as of the date of the Joint Proxy Statement, if
required, and as of the Closing Date to each counsel referred to in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
counsel. __

6.8  _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Combined Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such persons that are indemnified
as of the date of this Agreement

 by Hexcel pursuant to the Hexcel Certificate of Incorporation, the Hexcel
Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Hexcel Subsidiary and
any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof and
disclosed in Section 6.8(a) of the Hexcel Disclosure Schedule (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Hexcel Indemnified
Parties_ ") and such persons that are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by Woodward pursuant to the Woodward Certificate of Incorporation,
the Woodward Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Woodward
Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof and disclosed in Section 6.8(a) of the Woodward Disclosure Schedule (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Woodward
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising
out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
Hexcel or any Hexcel Subsidiary, or of Woodward or any Woodward Subsidiary,
and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Hexcel Indemnified Party or
Woodward Indemnified Party, to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Combined
Company shall cause to be maintained in effect insurance coverage equivalent
to the coverage under the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by Hexcel as of the date hereof ( _provided_ ,
that the Combined Company may substitute therefor policies with
a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Combined Company
shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of
300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Hexcel for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Combined Company
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Combined
Companys good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Hexcel
may, or at Woodwards request shall, obtain at or prior to the Effective Time
a six (6)-year "tail" policy under Hexcels existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Hexcel Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives. If the
Combined Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other person or
engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case, the Combined
Company or the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Combined Company or the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 6.8_.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Hexcel and Woodward shall each, on or before the
Closing Date, promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event,
circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _ARTICLE VII_ ; _provided_ , that
any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to
any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section_ __
_ 6.9_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_
to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall not cure
any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or
limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Hexcel and
Woodward shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Hexcel Common Stock and Woodward Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of shares of Hexcel Common Stock shall not receive
two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect
to their shares of Hexcel Common Stock and any shares of Woodward Common Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

6.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. Hexcel and Woodward shall give each other
prompt notice of any stockholder litigation against such party or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall give the other party the opportunity to participate (at
such others partys expense) in the defense or settlement of any such
litigation. Hexcel and Woodward shall give each other the right to review and
comment on all filings or responses to be made by such party in connection
with any such litigation, and will in good faith take such comments into
account. Neither Hexcel or Woodward shall agree to settle any such litigation
without the other partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that, without
limiting the foregoing, each party shall use reasonable best efforts so that
any settlement of any such litigation includes a full release of the other
party and its affiliates and does not impose any material injunction or other
material equitable relief after the Effective Time upon the Combined Company,
the Surviving Entity or any of their respective affiliates.

6.12 _Corporate Governance_ _; Headquarters; Other Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Woodward shall take all action necessary to

_Woodward Director Designee_ " and together with the Hexcel Director
Designees, the " _Director Designees_ ), which shall

 



-69- 

    

 include Thomas A. Gendron. Each of the Director Designees, with the
exception of Nick L. Stanage and Thomas A. Gendron, shall meet the
independence standards of the Nasdaq or the NYSE, as applicable, in each case
as may be applicable to the Combined Company as of the Effective Time. The
Director Designees shall initially be allocated in the classes as mutually
agreed by Hexcel and Woodward prior to the Effective Time.

6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to, and
shall not permit its and their other respective Representatives to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any
person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter
into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding)
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_) in connection with or relating to
any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Hexcel Vote, in the case of Hexcel, or the Requisite Woodward Vote, in the
case of Woodward, a party receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
not solicited in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, such party may, and
may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data
and participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person making the
Acquisition Proposal and such persons Representatives if the Board of
Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that taking such actions would be required to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that, prior to furnishing
any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be

 



-70- 

    

 provided pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on
terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with such party, and shall otherwise permit such party to
comply with its obligations herein. Each party will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Hexcel or Woodward, as applicable, with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction of
any confidential information previously delivered to any such person pursuant
to the terms of any confidentiality agreement to the extent provided by such
agreement.

 

(b) Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other
party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the
substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of
the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the
other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any
draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised
of any related material developments, discussions and negotiations on a
current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal (other than amendments or revisions that are
immaterial in all respects). Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to enforce any confidentiality agreements (other than "standstill" provisions
therein) to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a party in
accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall mean, with respect to Hexcel or Woodward, as applicable,
other than the Merger, any offer, proposal or inquiry, or any third-party
indication of interest, by or on behalf of any third party, relating to (i)
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a
party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
party, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in such third party (or its affiliates)
beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity
or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party,
which would, in the case of this clause (iii), result in the stockholders of
such party prior to such transaction ceasing to own at least seventy-five
percent (75%), directly or indirectly, of such party or its applicable
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



-71- 

    

6.14 _Public Announcements_. Hexcel and Woodward agree that the initial press
release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties
agrees that, without limiting _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, no public release or
announcement or other public statement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange to which the
relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, (b) for such releases, announcements or statements
that are consistent with other such releases, announcements or statements
made after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this _Section_ __ _
6.14_, or (c) for releases, announcements or statements made in connection
with a Recommendation Change or in connection with litigation between
the parties.

6.15 _Change of Method_. Without limiting the terms of this Agreement (a)
Hexcel and Woodward shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of
effecting the combination of Hexcel and Woodward (including the provisions of
_ARTICLE I_ ), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be
necessary, appropriate or desirable or (b) if, at any time during the period
beginning on the date that is forty (40) days after the date of this Agreement
and ending on the later of (x) the time that the S-4 shall have become
effective under the Securities Act and (y) the date that is sixty (60) days
after the date of this Agreement, either of the Boards of Directors of
Woodward or Hexcel determines in good faith that a change in the structure of
effecting the combination of Hexcel and Woodward to a Direct Merger would be
in the best interests of the Combined Company following the Merger, upon
written notice to the other party of such determination, Woodward and Hexcel
shall take all action necessary, and cooperate in good faith, to effect such
change in structure, including by making effective amendments to this
Agreement (including the provisions of _ARTICLE I_ ) and to the S-4 to the
extent necessary in connection therewith, provided that such notice may only
be delivered following good faith consultation with the other party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Woodward Common Stock received by
holders of shares of Hexcel Common Stock in exchange for each share of Hexcel
Common Stock, unless, in connection with any change effected pursuant to the
foregoing clause (b), the economic benefits that are intended to accrue to
Woodwards stockholders and Hexcels stockholders pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are identical in all
but _de_ _minimis_ respects, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
Woodwards stockholders or Hexcels stockholders pursuant to this Agreement,
(iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Hexcel, Woodward, the Combined
Company and/or their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or
(iv) would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or delay the consummation of such
transactions beyond the Termination Date. The parties agree to reflect any
such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both
parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_. __

 



-72- 

    

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Hexcel, Woodward, Merger Sub or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, and
each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Merger, each party and the members of their respective
Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Statute on the Merger, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.17  _Financing and Indebtedness_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good
faith to mutually determine and use reasonable best efforts to implement any
necessary, appropriate or desirable arrangements, in anticipation of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, regarding each partys and its Subsidiaries credit agreements,
indentures or other documents governing or relating to indebtedness of the
parties and their Subsidiaries, including arrangements by way of amendments,
consents, redemption, payoff, new financing or otherwise, with respect to
refinancing or retaining a partys or its Subsidiaries credit agreements or
senior notes.

6.18 _Exemption from Liability_ _Under_ _ Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. Hexcel and
Woodward agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the
officers and directors of Hexcel subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Hexcel Insiders_ "), both prior to
and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Hexcel Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Hexcel Common Stock into shares of Woodward Common Stock in the
Merger and the conversion of Hexcel Equity Awards into corresponding Woodward
Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_. Hexcel shall deliver to
Woodward in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate
information regarding the Hexcel Insiders, and the Boards of Directors of
Hexcel, Woodward, and the Combined Company, as applicable, or a committee of
non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be
required to cause (in the case of Hexcel) any dispositions of Hexcel Common
Stock or Hexcel Equity Awards by the Hexcel Insiders, and (in the case of
Woodward) any acquisitions of Woodward Common Stock or Woodward Equity Awards
by any Hexcel Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers
or directors of the Combined Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

6.19 _Transition_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and in all cases subject to applicable Law and  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_,
each of Hexcel and Woodward shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, during
normal business hours, reasonably cooperate with the other party and its
Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of the parties and their
respective businesses effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as
may be determined by Hexcel and Woodward. Neither Hexcel, Woodward nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ if such action would unduly disrupt its business.

 



-73- 

    

6.20 _Merger Sub Approval_. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, Woodward shall take all action necessary to cause this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, to
be adopted by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

 

6.21 _Charter Amendment Vote_. If the Charter Amendment Vote is not received
at the Woodward Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the Combined Company shall cause the Charter Amendment to be
submitted to the holders of shares of Woodward Common Stock for their approval
at the next annual meeting of its stockholders occurring following the Closing
Date, and the Combined Company and the Board of Directors of the Combined
Company shall recommend that the holders of shares of Woodward Common Stock
vote in favor of, and use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary
to obtain, the Charter Amendment Vote at such annual meeting and cause the
Charter Amendment to become effective immediately after the receipt of the
Charter Amendment Vote.

prohibition permanently enjoining or preventing the consummation of the
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval or the
issuance of such order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint, as
applicable, shall be principally due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either Hexcel or Woodward if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before December 31, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be principally due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Hexcel or Woodward ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any obligation, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the obligations,
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Woodward, in the case of a termination by Hexcel, or
Hexcel, in the case of a termination by Woodward, which breach or failure to
be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by
such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true),
would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, in the case of a termination
by Hexcel, or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, in the case of a termination by Woodward,
and which is not cured within thirty (30) days (or such fewer days as remain
prior to the Termination Date) following written notice to Woodward, in the
case of a termination by Hexcel, or Hexcel, in the case of a termination by
Woodward, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

 

(e) by either Hexcel or Woodward if (i) the Requisite Hexcel Vote shall not
have been obtained following a vote taken at the Hexcel Meeting (unless such
Hexcel Meeting has been validly adjourned or postponed, or validly requested
by Woodward to be adjourned or postponed, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.3_, in which case at the final adjournment or postponement thereof) upon
the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Hexcel or (ii) the
Requisite Woodward Vote shall not have been obtained following a vote taken at
the Woodward Meeting (unless such Woodward Meeting has been validly adjourned
or postponed, or validly requested by Hexcel to be adjourned or postponed, in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, in which case at the final adjournment

date of such termination), or (y) this Agreement is terminated by Hexcel
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or either Hexcel or Woodward pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)(ii)_ and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination, Woodward enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then
Woodward shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Hexcel, by
wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to two hundred and fifty million
dollars ($250,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)"
shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

 



-78- 

    

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Hexcel pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, or is terminated by Woodward or Hexcel pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)(ii)_ at such time as Hexcel was entitled to terminate

Hexcel, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2)
business days of the date of termination.

 

(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of Hexcel or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of Hexcel or any person shall have publicly announced an
Acquisition Proposal (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior
to the Hexcel Meeting), in each case with respect to Hexcel and (A) thereafter
(x) this Agreement is terminated by either Hexcel or Woodward pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Hexcel Vote having been obtained
(and all other conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ were satisfied
or, with respect to those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, were capable of being satisfied as of the date of
such termination), or (y) this Agreement is terminated by Woodward pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or either Hexcel or Woodward pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 8.1(e)(_ _i_ _)_ and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months
after the date of such termination, Hexcel enters into a definitive agreement
or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Hexcel
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and
the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Woodward, by wire transfer
of same-day funds, the Termination Fee; _provided_ , that for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to
"fifty percent (50%)."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Woodward pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, or is terminated by Woodward or Hexcel pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)(i)_ at such time as Woodward was entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, then Hexcel shall pay
Woodward, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within two
(2) business days of the date of termination.

(d) Except in the case of a Willful Breach by Hexcel or Woodward, as the case
may be which shall each be subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, following the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the payment of the
Termination Fee by Hexcel or Woodward, in circumstances in which it is due
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ in connection therewith, shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the other party under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party
to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted herein, in no event
shall either Hexcel or Woodward be required to pay the Termination Fee, as
applicable, more than once.

 



-79- 

    

(e) Each of Hexcel and Woodward acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Hexcel or Woodward,
as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for
the Termination Fee, as applicable, or any portion thereof, such non-paying
party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit. In addition, if Hexcel or Woodward, as the case may be, fails to pay the
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, then such party shall
pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime
rate" published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date on which such payment
was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that
such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate

to obtaining equitable relief.

any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any
amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

WOODWARD HEXCEL, INC.

 

A Delaware Corporation

FIRST. The name of the Corporation is Woodward Hexcel, Inc.

SECOND. The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State
of Delaware is National Registered Agents, Inc., 160 Greentree Drive, Suite
101, Dover, County of Kent, Delaware 19904. The name of its registered agent
at such address is National Registered Agents, Inc.

 

THIRD. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of Delaware as set forth in Title 8 of the Delaware Code.
Without limiting in any manner the scope and generality of the foregoing, the
nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted by the
Corporation includes:

 

A. To carry on and conduct any and every kind of manufacturing, distribution
and service business; to manufacture, process, fabricate, rebuild, service,
purchase or otherwise acquire, to design, invent or develop, to import or
export, and to distribute, lease, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of and
generally deal in and with raw materials, products, goods, wares, merchandise
and real and personal property of every kind and character; and to provide
services of every kind and character.

B. To acquire, own, hold, use, lease, mortgage, pledge, sell, convey, or
otherwise dispose of and deal in lands, leaseholds, and any interest, estates
and rights in real property, any personal or mixed property, and any tangible
or intangible property, legal and equitable.

 

C. In general, to possess and exercise all the powers and privileges granted
by the General Corporation Law of Delaware or by any other law of Delaware or
by this Certificate of Incorporation together with any powers incidental
thereto, so far as such powers and privileges are necessary or convenient to
the conduct, promotion or attainment of the business or purposes of the
Corporation. 

FOURTH. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 300,000,000, of which
290,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock with a par value of $0.001455 per
share, and 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock with a par value of
$0.003 per share.

 

The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series,
with each such series to consist of such number of shares and to have such
voting powers (whether less than, equal to or greater than one vote per
share), or limited voting powers or no voting powers, and such designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in
the

 



-2- 

    

 resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series adopted by
the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors is expressly vested with
authority to the full extent now or hereafter provided by law, to adopt any
such resolution or resolutions. The number of authorized shares of Preferred
Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock without a vote of the holders of the shares
of Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such
holders is required pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors providing for the issue of the series of Preferred Stock.

FIFTH. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be required (i) for the
adoption of any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of any provision of
this Certificate of Incorporation, (ii) for the adoption of any agreement for
the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other
corporation, (iii) to authorize any sale, lease or exchange of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or (iv) to authorize the
dissolution of the Corporation. Such affirmative vote shall be required
notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that some lesser
percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement to which the
Corporation is a party.

SIXTH. The holders of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to
cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that in
each election of directors each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to
cast as many votes as the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holder
multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and may cast all such
votes for the election of one nominee or distribute such votes among two or
more nominees as such holder chooses.

SEVENTH. The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and stockholders:

 

A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors. In connection with such management
the directors shall be guided by the philosophy and concepts of human and
industrial association of the Corporation as expressed in its Constitution.
The Board of Directors shall have the sole power to establish the
rights, qualifications, powers, duties, rules and procedures that from time
to time shall govern the Board of Directors and each of its members and that
from time to time shall affect the power of the Board of Directors to manage
the business and affairs of the Corporation. Without limiting in any manner
the scope and generality of the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall have
the sole power (i) to elect and empower the officers of the Corporation, (ii)
to designate and empower committees of the Board of Directors, (iii) to
determine the time, place, notice, quorum and voting requirements of meetings
of the Board of Directors and any committee thereof, and (iv) to determine the
manner in which action by the Board of Directors may be taken.

 



-3- 

    

B. The Board of Directors shall have concurrent power with the stockholders to
adopt, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation; provided, however,
that (i) the By-Laws of the Corporation shall not be adopted, amended or
repealed by the stockholders except by the affirmative vote of the holders of
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, and
(ii) no By-Law may be adopted by the stockholders which shall impair or
impede the power of the Board of Directors under paragraph A of this Article
SEVENTH.

C. The number of directors of the Corporation which shall constitute the
whole Board of Directors shall be not less than six, the exact number of
directors and the exact number of directors in each class to be determined
from time to time by the Board of Directors. Election of directors need not
be by written ballot unless the By-Laws so provide.



     | (1) |

The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II,
and Class III, which shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. Each
director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting
of stockholders following the annual meeting at which such director was
elected; provided, however, that each initial director in Class I shall hold
office until the annual meeting of stockholders next ensuing, each initial
director in Class II shall hold office until the annual meeting of
stockholders one year thereafter, and each initial director in Class III
shall hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders two years
thereafter. 

---|---|--- 



     | (2) |

If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be
apportioned among the three classes so as to maintain the number of directors
in each class as nearly equal as possible. In no case will a decrease in the
number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) |

Should a vacancy occur or be created, whether arising through resignation,
retirement, removal from office, disqualification, or death or through an
increase in the number of directors, such vacancy shall be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by
the sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall
hold office for the remaining term of the class in which the vacancy shall
have occurred or shall have been created. 

---|---|--- 



     | (4) |

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph C of Article
SEVENTH, each director shall serve until his or her successor is elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, retirement, removal from
office, disqualification or death. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (5) |

Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at
any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders
of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (6) |

All action by stockholders shall be taken at a meeting duly called and held.
The stockholders of the Corporation may not act by written consent. 

---|---|--- 



     | (7) |

Special meetings of the stockholders for any proper purpose or purposes may be
called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, and shall be called upon a request in writing therefor stating the
purpose or purposes thereof signed by the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. 

---|---|--- 
 



-4- 

    

EIGHTH. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision
contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or
places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in
the By-Laws of the Corporation.

 

NINTH. The Corporation shall indemnify each director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation and each person who is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise in the manner and to the extent provided in the By-Laws of
the Corporation as the same may be amended from time to time.

TENTH. A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended.

ELEVENTH. Subject to the provisions of Article FIFTH of this Certificate
of Incorporation, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change
or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or thereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

BYLAWS

 

OF

WOODWARD, INC 

Amended and Restated on January 11, 2020

 

ARTICLE I

OFFICES

 

Section 1.1 _Registered Office_

The registered office of Woodward, Inc. (the "Corporation") is in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.

 

Section 1.2 _Other Offices_

The Corporation may also have offices at such other places, both within and
without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time
determine.

 

ARTICLE II

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Section 2.1 _Place of Meetings_

 

Meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation must be held at such places,
either within or without the State of Delaware, as are designated from time
to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or
in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. The Board of Directors may, in
its sole discretion, determine that the meeting will not be held at any place,
but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as provided
under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). If a meeting of
stockholders by remote communication is authorized by the Board of Directors,
stockholders and proxy holders not physically present but attending by remote
communication will be deemed present in person, subject to compliance with
such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt.

 

Section 2.2 _Annual Meetings_

Annual meetings of stockholders for the election of directors must be held on
such dates and at such times as are designated from time to time by the Board
of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. At each annual meeting,
the stockholders may vote for election, in accordance with Section 3.1 of
these Bylaws, of those directors belonging to the class or classes of
directors to be elected at such meeting, and may transact such other business
as may properly be brought before the meeting.

   

Section 2.3 _Special Meetings_

 

Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation,
special meetings of stockholders must be called by the Secretary at the
request (i) of the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there
exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any
such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption), (ii) in
writing, of the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or (iii) in writing,
of holders of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of
all outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, and may not be
called absent such a request. Such request must state the purpose or purposes
of the proposed meeting and, in the case of a request by holders of
outstanding shares, must be delivered personally or sent by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the
Corporation. Business transacted at all special meetings of stockholders must
be confined to the matters set forth in the notice. The Board of Directors
must determine the date, time and place of any special meeting, which must, in
the case of Section 2.3(ii) or (iii), be held not less than thirty (30) nor
more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the receipt of the
request. Upon determination of the date, time and place of the meeting, the
officer receiving the request must cause notice to be given to the
stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.4 below. Nothing contained in this Section 2.3 is to be construed as
limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called
by action of the Board of Directors may be held.

 

Section 2.4 _Notice of Meetings_

 

Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of all meetings must be
given stating the date, time and place of the meeting, the means of
remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL, the written notice of any meeting
must be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at that meeting not less
than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.

 

Section 2.5 _Quorum_

Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or
by these Bylaws, a majority of the shares entitled to vote, present in person
or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders. Withdrawal of any stockholders present or represented by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders will not cause failure of a duly constituted
quorum at that meeting. Shares of the Corporations own stock belonging to the
Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled
to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held,
directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, are neither entitled to vote nor
may they be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that
the foregoing does not limit the right of any corporation to vote stock,
including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary
capacity. The Chairman of the meeting or the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy, by vote of a majority of the shares represented, may
adjourn the meeting despite the absence of a quorum.

Section 2.6 _Adjournments_  

Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from
time to time either by the Chairman of the meeting or by the vote of
a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not
be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and the place thereof, and the 

 



2

    

 means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned
meeting, the Corporation may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 

Section 2.7 _Voting_

 

(a) Record Name. Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose
names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the Corporation
on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at a
meeting will be entitled to vote at such meeting.

 

(b) Votes Per Share; Cumulative Voting. Unless otherwise provided by law or by
the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders is entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock
held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question.
In the election of directors, and for any other action, voting need not be
by written ballot unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy
at such meeting or the Chairman of the meeting so determine. In accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Common Stock of the
Corporation are entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of
directors, which means that in each election of directors each holder of
Common Stock is entitled to cast as many votes as the number of shares of
Common Stock held by such holder multiplied by the number of directors to be
elected and may cast all such votes for the election of one nominee or
distribute such votes among two (2) or more nominees as such holder chooses.

(c) Vote Required  Election of Directors.

 

(i) Majority/Plurality. Except as otherwise provided by these Bylaws, a
nominee for director must be elected by a majority of the votes cast in
person or by proxy with respect to such nominees election at any meeting of
the stockholders that includes the election of directors at which a quorum is
present. For purposes of this Section 2.7(c), a majority of the votes cast
means that the number of votes cast "for" a nominees election exceeds the
number of votes cast "against" that nominees election. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a nominee for director will be elected by a plurality of the votes
cast in person or by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders that includes
the election of directors at which a quorum is present if, as of the tenth
(10th) day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice
of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the Corporation, the
number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested
Election"), provided that with respect to any nominee proposed or nominated by
a stockholder, the Secretary of the Corporation must have received proper
notice under Section 2.11 of these Bylaws. For purposes of this Section
2.7(c), if plurality voting is applicable to the election of directors at any
meeting, the nominees who receive the highest number of votes cast "for,"
without regard to votes cast "against" or "withhold," will be elected as
directors up to the total number of directors to be elected at that
meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as a vote cast with
respect to any election of directors.

 



3

    

(ii) Resignations. In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of
the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such
person must submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (i) that person
not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a
Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of
Directors in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by the Board of
Directors for such purpose. If an incumbent director fails to receive a
majority of votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the
Nominating and Governance Committee will, within sixty (60) days after the
date of certification of the election results, recommend to the Board of
Directors whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent
director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will
act on the resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance
Committees recommendation, and within ninety (90) days after the date of
certification of the election results, the Board of Directors will disclose
its decision and rationale regarding whether to accept the resignation (or the
reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) in a press
release, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or by other
public announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (a) the
Nominating and Governance Committee fails to make a recommendation within
sixty (60) days after the date of certification of the election results, or
(b) a majority of the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are
nominees for director who did not receive a majority of the votes cast in an
election that is not a Contested Election, the Board of Directors will make
the determination to accept or reject the resignations without any
recommendation from the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating
and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors may consider any factors
and other information they deem appropriate and relevant in deciding whether
to accept a directors resignation.

 

(iii) Following Board Determination. If an incumbent director fails to receive
the required vote for re-election in an election that is not a Contested
Election and such directors resignation is not accepted by the Board of
Directors, such director will continue to serve until the expiration date of
such directors term in office or until such directors earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. If such
directors resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, or if a nominee
for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director,
then the Board of Directors may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to Section
3.3 of these Bylaws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors
pursuant to Section 3.1 of these Bylaws.

(d) Vote Required  Other. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-
thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation is
required (i) for the adoption of any amendment, alteration, change or repeal
of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, (ii) for the adoption of
any agreement for the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into
any other corporation, (iii) to authorize any sale, lease or exchange of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, (iv) to authorize the
dissolution of the Corporation, (v) to remove a director for cause, or (vi)
for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend or

 



4

    

 repeal these Bylaws. Such affirmative vote is required notwithstanding the
fact that no vote may be required, or that some lesser percentage may be
specified, by law or in any agreement to which the Corporation is a party.
All other elections and questions must, unless otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, be decided by the vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote
thereon present in person or by proxy at the meeting.

Section 2.8 _Proxies_

 

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, which proxy
must be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at or before the meeting
at which it is to be used, but no such proxy may be voted or acted upon after
three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to
act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such persons signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature. A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to
act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the
transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic
transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy
solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means
of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is
determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions
are valid, the inspectors, or if there are no inspectors, such other persons
making that determination must specify the information upon which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission created pursuant to Section 212(c) of the DGCL may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any
and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reproduction must be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing
or transmission. A duly executed proxy is irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy, which is not irrevocable, by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing with the Secretary an instrument in writing revoking the
proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date.

Section 2.9 _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_

 

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger must prepare and make, or cause
to be prepared and made, at least ten (10) days before every meeting
of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Nothing in this section requires the Corporation to include
electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on that
list. The list must be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior
to

 



5

    

 the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided
that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the
notice of the meeting; or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the
principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, the list must also be produced and kept at the time and place
of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
stockholder of the Corporation who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, the list must also be open to the
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list must be provided with the notice of the meeting.

Section 2.10  _Stock Ledger_

The stock ledger of the Corporation is the only evidence as to who are the
stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders
required by Section 2.9 or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person
or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 

Section 2.11 _Notice of Stockholder Nominations and Other Business_

 

(a) Proper Business; Nominations. No business may be transacted at an annual
meeting of stockholders, other than business that is: (i) specified in the
notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of
the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof); (ii)
otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction
of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof); or (iii)
otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder. In
addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations or
other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder: (i) such stockholder must be a stockholder of record on the date
of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 and on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such
annual meeting; (ii) such stockholder must provide timely notice in writing to
the Corporations Secretary pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.11; (iii) such other business must be a proper matter for
stockholder action under the DGCL; (iv) if the stockholder, or the beneficial
owner on whose behalf any such nomination or proposal is made, provides the
Corporation with a Solicitation Notice (as defined in this Section 2.11),
such stockholder or beneficial owner must in the case of a proposal, have
delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the
percentage of the Corporations voting shares required under applicable law
to carry any such proposal, or, in the case of a nomination or nominations,
have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a percentage
of the Corporations voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or
beneficial owner to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to
be nominated by such stockholder, and must, in either case, have included in
those materials the Solicitation Notice; and (v) if no Solicitation Notice
relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this Section 2.11, the
stockholder or beneficial owner proposing such business or nomination must not
have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have required the delivery of
such a Solicitation Notice.

 



6

    

(b) Timeliness. To be timely, a stockholders notice to the Secretary (other
than a request for inclusion of a proposal in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule l4a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act")) must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the
Corporations principal executive offices (addressed to the attention of the
Secretary) not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
meeting of stockholders. Provided, however, that in the event that the annual
meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or
after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely
must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the Corporations principal
executive offices not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was
mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made,
whichever first occurs, or no less than ninety (90) days nor more than one
hundred twenty (120) days prior to the annual meeting. In the event that the
number of a class of directors to be elected is increased and there is no
public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the
size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least one
hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years
annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 2.11 will also
be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if the notice is delivered to, or mailed
and received at, the Corporations principal executive offices (addressed to
the attention of the Secretary) not later than ten (10) days following the day
on which the Corporation makes such public announcement.

(c) Information Required. The stockholders notice pursuant to this Section
2.11 must include all of the following: (i) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, (A)

agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any
borrowing or lending of shares of capital stock of the Corporation) has been
made by or on behalf of such nominated person, or any affiliates or

foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock
price changes for, such nominated person, or any affiliates or associates of
such nominated person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or
pecuniary or economic interest of such nominated person, or any affiliates or
associates of such nominated person, with respect to the capital stock of the
Corporation; (F) a description of all agreements, arrangements or

 



7

whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option,

been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or such beneficial
owner, or any affiliates or associates of the foregoing persons, with respect
to the capital stock of the Corporation; (vii) whether and the extent to
which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding
(including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such stockholder
or such beneficial owner, or any affiliates or associates of the foregoing
persons, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss
to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such stockholder
or such beneficial owner, or any affiliates or associates of the foregoing
persons, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic
interest of such stockholder or such beneficial owner, or any affiliates or

of holders of the Corporations voting shares to elect such nominee or
nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a "Solicitation Notice"). A
stockholder providing notice of any nomination or proposal of business
in accordance with this Section 2.11 shall further update and supplement such
notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be
provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.11 is true and correct as
of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive
notice of the annual meeting, and such update and supplement shall be
delivered to, or mailed and received at, the Corporations principal executive
offices (addressed to the attention of the Secretary) not later than five (5)
business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled
to receive notice of the annual meeting.

 



8

    

(d) Inclusion in Company Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.11, in order to include information with respect
to a stockholder proposal in the Corporations proxy statement and form of
proxy for a stockholders meeting, a stockholder must provide notice as
required by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. Nothing in
these Bylaws is deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request
inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule
14a-8 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule.

(e) Special Meeting Nominations. At any special meeting of the stockholders,
only such business may be conducted as is brought before the meeting pursuant
to the Corporations notice of meeting. In the event that a special meeting of
the stockholders is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors,
nominations of a person or persons for election may be made (i) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by a stockholder who complies with
the procedures in this Section 2.11 if such stockholder is a stockholder of
record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section
2.11 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
vote at such special meeting and such stockholder provides timely notice in
writing to the Corporations Secretary (including all of the information
required by paragraph (c) of this Section 2.11) not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the
date of the special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date
of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs, or no less than
ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the
special meeting.

 

(f) Determination of Proper Business. Only such persons who are nominated in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 will be
eligible to serve as directors and only such business may be conducted at a
meeting of stockholders as is brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11; provided, however, that once
business has been properly brought before a meeting in accordance with such
procedures, nothing in this Section 2.11 will be deemed to preclude discussion
by any stockholder of any such business (subject to any rules for the
orderly conduct of the meeting as may be adopted by the Chairman of the
meeting or the Board of Directors). The Chairman of the meeting and the Board
of Directors each has the power to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 and, if any proposed
nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 2.11, to declare
that such defective proposal be disregarded and not presented for stockholder
action.

(g) No New Time Period. In no event will the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of an annual or special meeting commence a new
time period for the giving of a stockholders notice.

(h) Public Announcement. For the purposes of this Section 2.11, a "public
announcement" includes disclosure in a press release issued to a national news
service, in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with, or furnished on
Form 8-K to, the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange
Act, or other method deemed to be a public announcement under the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 



9

    

(i) Delivery. For purposes of this Section 2.11, delivery of a proxy statement
or delivery of a form of a proxy includes sending a Notice of Internet
Availability of Proxy Materials in accordance with Rules 14a-16 under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 2.12 _Inspectors of Election_

 

Before any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors must appoint one or
more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report of the
meeting. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
Chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors. No nominee for
the office of director may be appointed inspector. Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector, must take and sign an
oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality
and according to the best of such inspectors ability. The duties of these
inspectors are as follows:

 

(i) Ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each;

 

(ii) Determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies
and ballots;

 

(iii) Count all votes and ballots;

 

(iv) Determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition
of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and

(v) Certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the
meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots.

The inspector(s) may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the
inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors.

Section 2.13 _Action without Meeting_

 

In accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, no action may be taken by
the stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders
called in accordance with these Bylaws, and no action may be taken by the
stockholders by written consent.

Section 2.14 _Organization_  

(a) Chair and Secretary of Meeting. Except as otherwise determined by the
Board of Directors, at every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the
Board of Directors, or, if a Chairman has not been appointed or is absent, the
Chief Executive Officer, or, if the Chief Executive Officer is absent, the
President, or, if the President is absent, a Chairman of the meeting chosen
by a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote, acts as Chairman. The Secretary, or, if the
Secretary is absent, an Assistant Secretary or other person directed to do so
by the Chairman of the meeting, acts as secretary of the meeting.

 



10

    

(b) Stockholder Meeting Rules. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is
entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of
stockholders as it deems necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such
rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the Chairman of the
meeting has the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such Chairman, are
necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting,
including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business
for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to
stockholders of record of the Corporation and their duly authorized
and constituted proxies and such other persons as the Chairman may permit,
restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement
thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for
balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot. The date and time of
the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the
stockholders will vote at the meeting must be announced at the meeting.
Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the Chairman
of the meeting, meetings of stockholders are not required to be held in
accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.

 

ARTICLE III

DIRECTORS

 

Section 3.1 _Number and Term of Office_

 

The Board of Directors is divided into three (3) classes, designated Class I,
Class II and Class III. Each class must be as nearly equal in number as
possible. The number of directors which constitutes the whole Board of
Directors must not be less than six (6), the exact number of directors and the
exact number of directors in each class to be determined from time to time
by resolution of the Board of Directors. At each annual meeting, successors
to the class of directors whose term expired at that annual meeting are
elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors has changed, any
increase or decrease must be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain
the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any
additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an
increase in such class holds office for a term that coincides with the
remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of
directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director holds office
until the annual meeting of stockholders for the year in which his or her
term expires and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, subject,
however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal
from office. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or
more classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Corporation, if any,
have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office,
filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships is governed by
the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such
directors so elected will not be divided into classes pursuant to this Section
3.1 unless expressly provided by such terms.

 



11

    

Section 3.2 _Nominations_

 

Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at
any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors: (a) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who: (i) is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of
the notice provided for in Section 2.11 and on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting; and (ii)
timely complies with all of the procedures set forth in Section 2.11. No
person is eligible for election as a director unless nominated as set forth
in this Section 3.2. If either the Chairman of the meeting or the Board of
Directors determines that a nomination was not made as set forth in this
Section 3.2, the Chairman must declare to the meeting that the nomination was
defective and that such defective nomination must be disregarded.

Section 3.3 _Vacancies_

 

Vacancies in the Board of Directors and newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by
a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or
by the sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy holds
office for the remaining term of the class in which the vacancy occurs or is
created.

 

Section 3.4 _Removal_

Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at
any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders
of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation.

Section 3.5 _Resignation_

 

Any director may resign at any time by delivering his or her notice in writing
or by electronic transmission to the Secretary, such resignation to
specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by
the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. If no such
specification is made, it is deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of
Directors. A resignation that is conditioned upon the director failing to
receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is
irrevocable. When one or more directors resigns from the Board of Directors,
effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office,
including those who have so resigned, may fill such vacancy or vacancies, the
vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations become
effective.

 

Section 3.6 _Duties and Powers_

The business and affairs of the Corporation are managed by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the
Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to
be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



12

    

Section 3.7 _Meetings_

 

The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either
within or without the State of Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors may be held without call or notice at such time and at such place
as may from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. Special
meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman or any two
directors. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting
must be given to each director either by mail not less than forty-eight (48)
hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone (including a voice
messaging or other system or technology designed to record and communicate
messages), electronic mail or other electronic means, facsimile or telegram on
twenty-four (24) hours notice.

 

Section 3.8 _Quorum_

Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, at all meetings of the Board of Directors a
majority of the exact number of directors fixed from time to time by the Board
of Directors in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and these
Bylaws constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum is
the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum is not present at any meeting
of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum is present.

 

Section 3.9 _Actions without Meeting_

 

Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board
of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if
all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be,
consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or
writings or electronic transmission or electronic transmissions are filed
with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee
thereof. Such filing must be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in
paper form and must be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in
electronic form.

Section 3.10 _Meetings by Electronic Communications Equipment_

 

Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board
of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such
committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 3.10
constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

Section 3.11  _Conduct of Meetings_

The Chairman of the Board of Directors or in his or her absence a chairman
chosen by a majority at the meeting presides at meetings of the Board of
Directors. The Secretary acts as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her
absence, the Chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting.

 



13

    

Section 3.12 _Remuneration_

 

The directors may be paid such remuneration, if any, as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine. Any remuneration so payable to a director
who is also an officer or employee of the Corporation or who is counsel or
solicitor to the Corporation or otherwise serves it in a professional capacity
must, unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, be in addition to
such directors salary as such officer or employee or to his or her
professional fees, as the case may be. In addition, the Board of Directors may
by resolution from time to time award special remuneration out of the funds of
the Corporation to any director who performs any special work or service for,
or undertakes any special mission on behalf of, the Corporation outside of the
work or service ordinarily required of a director of the Corporation. The
directors may also be paid such sums in respect of their out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board of Directors or otherwise
in respect of the performance by them of their duties as the Board
of Directors may from time to time determine. Confirmation by the
stockholders of any such remuneration or payment is not required.

 

Section 3.13 _Interested Directors_

 

No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its
directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other
corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or
more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a
financial interest, is void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely
because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting
of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract
or transaction, or solely because his or her vote is counted for such purpose
if: (a) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as
to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good
faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or (b) the material facts as to his or her
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract
or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
stockholders; or (c) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation
as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of
Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the Board of Directors or of a committee, which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

Section 3.14 _Committees_

 

(a) Executive Committee. The Board of Directors may appoint an Executive
Committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The
Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law, these Bylaws, the
Executive Committee Charter or other resolutions of the Board of Directors
will have and may exercise, when the Board of Directors is not in session, all
the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the

 



14

    

 power to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock, and may
authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may
require it; but such committee will not have the power or authority to (i)
approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter
expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval,
or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the Corporation.

(b) Other Committees. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, appoint
such other committees as may be permitted by law. Such other committees
appointed by the Board of Directors must consist of one or more of the
directors of the Corporation and will have such powers and perform such duties
as may be prescribed by the resolution or resolutions creating
such committees, but in no event will any such committee have the powers
denied to the Executive Committee in these Bylaws.

(c) Term. The Board of Directors may at any time increase or decrease the
number of members of a committee or terminate the existence of a committee.
The membership of a committee member will terminate on the date of his or her
death or voluntary resignation from the committee or from the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors may at any time for any reason remove any
individual committee member and the Board of Directors may fill any committee
vacancy created by death, resignation, removal or increase in the number of
members of the committee. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or
disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.

 

(d) Meetings. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee
designated by the Board may make, alter and repeal rules of the conduct of
its business. In the absence of such rules, each committee must conduct its
business in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its business
pursuant to these Bylaws.

 

ARTICLE IV

OFFICERS

 

Section 4.1 _General_

 

(a) Board Elected Officers. The officers of the Corporation elected by the
Board of Directors are a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief
Financial Officer, a Secretary, one (1) or more Vice Presidents and such other
officers as the Board of Directors may deem expedient, and those officers are
to be elected in such manner and hold their offices for such terms as the
Board of Directors may prescribe. The Board of Directors may elect the
Chairman of the Board of Directors as an officer of the Corporation, provided
that the Chairman will not be regarded as an officer of the Corporation unless
the Board of Directors so determines at the time of election in accordance
with these Bylaws. The same person may hold any number of offices, unless
otherwise prohibited by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.
The officers of the Corporation need not be stockholders of the Corporation
nor, except in the case of the Chairman of the Board, need such officers be
directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may from time to time, in
its discretion, assign titles, powers, duties and reporting arrangements for
any elected officer. The salaries and other compensation of the officers of
the Corporation may be fixed by or in the manner designated by the Board of
Directors.

 



15

    

(b) Other Officers. In addition to the officers elected by the Board of
Directors in accordance with Section 4.1(a), the Corporation may have one or
more appointed Vice Presidents, Assistant Secretaries or other officers, who
will also be officers of the Corporation (each an "Appointed Officer").
Appointed Officers are appointed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Executive Officer may from time to time, in his or her discretion, assign
titles, powers, duties, scope of job responsibilities and reporting
arrangements for any Appointed Officer, consistent with Section 4.2 below.

Section 4.2 _Tenure and Duties of Officers_

 

(a) Tenure. All officers hold office at the pleasure of the Board of Directors
and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, unless sooner
removed. Any officer elected by the Board of Directors may be removed at any
time by the Board of Directors. If the office of any elected officer becomes
vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be left vacant or be filled by the
Board of Directors. Any Appointed Officer may be removed at any time by the
Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. If the office of any
Appointed Officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be left
vacant or be filled by the Chief Executive Officer. Nothing in these Bylaws
is to be construed as creating any kind of contractual right to employment
with the Corporation.

 

(b) Duties. The officer(s) bearing the titles set forth below will have the
powers and duties set forth below unless otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors.

(i) Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors
presides at all meetings of the stockholders and the Board of Directors,
unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise. The Chairman of the Board
of Directors must perform such other duties and will have such other powers as
the Board of Directors designates from time to time.

(ii) Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer has, subject to the
oversight of the Board of Directors, general supervision, direction and
control of the business and the officers, employees and agents of the
Corporation. In the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer, if such officer is a director, presides at all meetings of the Board
of Directors, unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise. The Chief
Executive Officer must perform such other duties and will have such other
powers as the Board of Directors designates from time to time.

 

(iii) President. Subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors and the
supervision, control and authority of the Chief Executive Officer, the
President has general supervision, direction and control of the business and
the officers, employees and agents of the Corporation. The President must
perform such other duties and will have such other powers as the Board
of Directors designates from time to time.

 



16

    

(iv) Vice Presidents. The Vice Presidents (however designated and
whether elected by the Board of Directors or appointed by the Chief Executive
Officer) have the powers and must perform the duties that pertain to, or
relate to, such Vice Presidents designated job or business function and will
have such other powers and must perform such other duties as the Board of
Directors or the Chief Executive Officer designates from time to time.

 

(v) Secretary. The Secretary must keep, or cause to be kept, a book of minutes
of all meetings of directors, committees of directors and stockholders. The
Secretary must give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the
stockholders and special meetings of the Board of Directors, and must perform
such other duties and will have such other powers as the Board of Directors
designates from time to time. If the Secretary is unable, or refuses, to cause
to be given notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of
the Board of Directors, and if there is no Assistant Secretary, then either
the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board may choose another
officer to cause such notice to be given. The Secretary has custody of the
seal of the Corporation, and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, if
there is one, has the authority to affix the same to any instrument requiring
it and, when so affixed, such seal may be attested by the signature of the
Secretary or by the signature of any Assistant Secretary. The Board of
Directors may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal
of the Corporation and to attest the affixing of his or her signature. The
Secretary must see that all books, reports, statements, certificates or other
documents and records required by law to be kept or filed are properly kept
or filed, as the case may be. It is the duty of the Assistant Secretaries to
assist the Secretary in the performance of the Secretarys powers and duties
and generally to have such other powers and perform such other duties as may
be delegated to them by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive
Officer.

(vi) Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Each of the Chief Financial
Officer and the Treasurer controls, audits and arranges the financial affairs
of the Corporation, consistent with the responsibilities delegated to each of
them by the Corporations Chief Executive Officer or President. The Chief
Financial Officer or Treasurer, as the case may be, receives and deposits all
monies belonging to the Corporation and pays out the same only in such manner
as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, and will have such
other powers and must perform such other duties as the Board of Directors may
require.

(c) Resignation. Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President or the Secretary. Any such resignation will take effect
on the date of receipt of such notice or at any later time specified therein;
and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation is
not necessary to make it effective. Any such resignation is without prejudice
to the rights, if any, of the Corporation under any contract to which the
officer is a party.

Section 5.2 _Voting Securities Owned by the Corporation_

 

Powers of attorney, proxies, waivers of notice of meeting, consents and other
instruments relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed
in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chief Executive
Officer, the President or the Chief Financial Officer and any such officer

any such officer may deem advisable to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of security holders of any corporation in which the Corporation may
own securities and at any such meeting possess and may exercise any and all
rights and powers incident to the ownership of such securities and which, as
the owner thereof, the Corporation might have exercised and possessed if

ARTICLE VI

 

SHARES OF STOCK

Section 6.1  _Form and Execution of Certificates_

The shares of the Corporation will be represented by certificates, provided
that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that
some or all of any or all classes or series of the Corporations stock may be
uncertificated. Certificates for the shares of stock of the Corporation, if
any, are to be in such form as is consistent with the Certificate of
Incorporation and applicable law. Every holder of stock in the Corporation
represented by certificate is entitled to have a certificate signed by or in
the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the
President or any Vice President, and by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer
or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares owned
by such holder in the Corporation. Any or all of the signatures on the
certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate ceases to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
date of issue. Any certificate may also contain such legend or other statement
as may be required by law or by any agreement between the Corporation and the
issuee thereof.

Section 6.2 _Lost Certificates_

 

A new certificate or uncertificated shares may be issued in place of any
certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or
destroyed. The Corporation may require, as a condition precedent to the
issuance of a new certificate or uncertificated shares, the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owners legal
representative, to agree to indemnify the Corporation in such manner as it
requires or to give the Corporation a surety bond in such form and amount as
it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

 

Section 6.3 _Transfer Agents and Registrars_

 

The Board of Directors may from time to time appoint one or more transfer
agents and registrars in one or more cities; may require all certificates
evidencing shares of stock of the Corporation to bear the signature of a
transfer agent and registrar; and may provide that such certificates may be
transferable in more than one city.

 

Section 6.4 _Transfers_

Transfers of record of shares of stock of the Corporation may be made only
upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by attorney duly
authorized, and, in the case of stock represented by certificate, upon the
surrender of a properly endorsed certificate or certificates for a like
number of shares. The Corporation has the power to enter into and perform any
agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock
of the Corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the
Corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any
manner not prohibited by the DGCL

 



19

    

Section 6.5 _Fixing Record Dates_

 

(a) For Notice and Meetings. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a
record date, which record date must not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which record date must, subject to applicable law, not be more than sixty
(60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record
date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
must be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders applies to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

(b) For Other Purposes. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix,
in advance, a record date, which record date must not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date
must be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date
is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose
must be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 

Section 6.6 _Registered Stockholders_

 

The Corporation is entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person
registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to
vote as such owner, and is not bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person
whether or not it has express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
provided by the laws of Delaware.

ARTICLE VII

 

NOTICES

Section 7.1  _Written Notice_

Whenever written notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation
or these Bylaws, to be given to any director, member of a committee or
stockholder, such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such director,
member of a committee or stockholder, at his or her address as it appears on
the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such
notice is deemed to be given at the time when the same is deposited in the
United States mail.

 



20

    

Section 7.2 _Notice by Electronic Transmission to Stockholders_

 

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under
any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws
is effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the
stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent is revocable by the
stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent is deemed
revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission
two (2) consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such
consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other
person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the
inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation will not
invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this section
is deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a
number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by
electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an
electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of
such specific posting, upon the later of (a) such posting and (b) the giving
of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic
transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or the agent of the
Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic
transmission is, in the absence of fraud, prima facie evidence of the facts
stated therein. For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means
any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of
paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such
a recipient through an automated process.

Section 7.3 _Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address_

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation is
effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an
address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom notice is
given. Any consent is revocable by the stockholder by written notice to
the Corporation. A stockholder who fails to object in writing to the
Corporation, within sixty (60) days of having been given written notice by the
Corporation of its intention to send the single notice will be deemed to have
consented to receiving the single notice.

Section 7.4 _Waiver_

 

Whenever any notice is required by the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation
or these Bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or
a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, is deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of that
meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of
the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic
transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation.

from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper as a reserve or
reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing
or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for any proper purpose, and

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.1  _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other Than
Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_

Subject to Section 9.3, the Corporation must indemnify any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation)
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
against costs, charges (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, will not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his
or her conduct was unlawful.

Section 9.2 _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in
the Right of the Corporation_

Subject to Section 9.3, the Corporation must indemnify any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against costs, charges, expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such action, suit or proceeding
if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that
no indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person is adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or misconduct
in the performance of his or her duty to the Corporation unless and only to
the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such
action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the
adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the
case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
costs which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court deems proper.

 



23

    

Section 9.3 _Authorization of Indemnification_

 

Any indemnification under this Article IX (unless ordered by a court) may be
made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon
a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or
officer is proper in the circumstances because such director or officer has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.2, as
the case may be. Such determination must be made with respect to a person who
is a director or officer at the time of such determination: (i) by a majority
vote of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding,
even though less than a quorum; (ii) by a committee of such directors
designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum;
(iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (iv) by the stockholders.
To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue
or matter therein, he or she must be indemnified against expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection
therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. 

Section 9.4 _Good Faith Defined_

 

For purposes of any determination under Section 9.3, a person is deemed to
have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause
to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based
on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise,
or on information supplied to him or her by the officers of the Corporation or
another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal
counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or
records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The
term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 9.4 means any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this
Section 9.4 are not exclusive nor do they limit in any way the circumstances
in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.2, as the case may be.

Section 9.5 _Indemnification by a Court_

 

Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section
9.3, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder,
any present or former director or officer may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent
otherwise permissible under Sections 9.1 and 9.2. The basis of such
indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that
indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances
because such director or officer has met the applicable standards of conduct
set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.2, as the case may be. Neither a contrary
determination in the specific case under Section 9.3 nor the absence of any
determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a
presumption that the

 



24

    

 director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable
standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to
this Section 9.5 must be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of
such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer
seeking indemnification will also be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting such application.

 

Section 9.6 _Expenses Payable in Advance_

 

Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit
or proceeding must be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it is
ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article IX. Such expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other
employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any,
as the Corporation deems appropriate.

Section 9.7 _Nonexclusivity_ _of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article IX are not exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under
any Bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of
competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it
being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons
specified in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 must be made to the fullest extent permitted
by law. The provisions of this Article IX do not preclude the indemnification
of any person who is not specified in Sections 9.1 or 9.2 but whom the
Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.

 

Section 9.8 _Insurance_

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person
against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX.

 

Section 9.9 _Certain Definitions_

 

For purposes of this Article IX, references to "the Corporation" include, in
addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including
any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors and officers, so that any person who is or was
a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of such

 constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, will stand in the same position under the provisions of this
Article IX with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she
would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued. For purposes of this Article IX, references to
"fines" include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such
director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan,
its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in
a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan will be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article IX.

Section 9.10 _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_

 

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article IX will, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 

Section 9.11 _Limitation on Indemnification_

 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IX to the contrary, except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which will be governed
by Section 9.5), the Corporation is not obligated to indemnify any present or
former director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Section 9.12 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_

 

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those
conferred in this Article IX to directors and officers of the Corporation.

 

Section 9.13 _Enforceability_

The provisions of this Article IX are applicable to all actions, suits or
proceedings pending at the time or commenced after the adoption of this
Article IX, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring, or based
on claims asserted, before or after the adoption of this Article IX. If this
Article IX or any portion hereof is invalidated on any ground by a court of
competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation must nevertheless indemnify each
director or officer of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in any judgment
or settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, including any action by or in the
right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable
portion of this Article IX that is not invalidated and to the full extent
permitted by applicable law.
