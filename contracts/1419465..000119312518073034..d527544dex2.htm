matters described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, or (2) any amendment to
or replacement of the Equity Commitment Letter to effect (I) the replacement
of any Equity Investor (other than CDPQ) with a successor Equity Investor 
 -  37  - 



      |

the Equity Commitment Letter so long as such successor Equity Investor
otherwise agrees to substantially the same terms and conditions as such
original Equity Investor under the Equity Commitment Letter, or (II) the
withdrawal of any Equity Investor (other than CDPQ) so long as the Equity
Financing from CDPQ or the Debt Financing is correspondingly increased by the

extent such amendment does not result in any of the matters described in
clauses (A), (B) and (C) above. The Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Company in writing of (and such written notice shall include reasonable
details related to, and reasons for, any of the following): (i) the

whether or not in writing) of the Commitment Letters for any reason; (ii)
receipt of written notice of the refusal of any Lender or, as applicable,
Equity Investor to provide, or of any stated intent by any such Lender or
Equity Investor to refuse to provide, the full Financing contemplated by the

to satisfy its obligations under Section 4.3(4), Section 4.3(5) or
this Section 4.3(6); or (iii) for any reason, all or any portion of the
Financings becoming unavailable, or is expected, or would reasonable be
expected to, become unavailable, on the terms and conditions contemplated in
any Commitment Letters (including any executed fee letter related to the Debt

the Company, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange for the same
or alternative financing (or for additional financing from the original
Lenders or any original Equity Investor) to replace the Financing contemplated
by such expired, repudiated or terminated commitments or arrangements or for
which such Lender or Equity Investor has refused to provide, which
alternative financing would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impair or delay the consummation of the Arrangement when required pursuant to
Section 2.9(1). The Purchaser shall deliver correct and complete copies of
any modified or replacement Commitment Letters to the Company as promptly as
practicable following the execution thereof (provided, that the existence
and/or amount of "market flex" provisions, fees, pricing terms and pricing
caps and other economic terms set forth in any such agreement may be
redacted). In the event that any Commitment Letter is amended, restated,
amended and restated, supplemented, modified, or replaced, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" or "Equity Commitment Letter" (as applicable) as used
herein shall be deemed to include the new or amended commitment letters or
arrangements described in this Section 4.3(6) to the extent then in effect,
the term "Debt Financing", "Equity Financing" and "Financings" as used herein
shall be deemed to include the applicable financing contemplated by any such
new or amended commitment letters or arrangements, and the term "Lenders" and
"Equity Investors" as used herein shall be deemed to include the applicable
lenders or sources of equity financing contemplated by any such new or amended
commitment letters or arrangements.

   (7) |

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except (i) as provided in Section
4.3(6) and Section 4.8 and (ii) for any condition to the consummation of the

the Company set forth in this Agreement, none of the Company or any of its
affiliates or Representatives shall have any responsibility for any financing
that the Purchaser may raise in connection with the 
 -  38  - 



      |

 transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser also acknowledges and agrees
that the Purchasers obtaining financing is not a condition to any of its
obligations hereunder, regardless of the reasons why financing is not
obtained or whether such reasons are within or beyond the control of the
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, if any financing referred to in Section
4.3(4), Section 4.3(5) and Section 4.3(6) is not obtained (other than due to
the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing resulting
from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company set forth in this Agreement), the Purchaser shall continue to be
obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
subject to and on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

   (8) |

The Purchaser shall consult with and keep the Company informed in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financings. None of
Purchaser, the Equity Investors or any of their respective Affiliates shall
take any action that could reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Financings.

as promptly as practicable, all documentation and information that is
required, or in the opinion of the Company and Purchaser, acting reasonably,

their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such information does not
contain a Misrepresentation; provided, however, that nothing in this

 provision shall require a Party to provide information that is not in its
possession or not otherwise reasonably available to such Party. 

---|---

the case of the notification under the HSR Act, the Parties need only exchange
the first three pages of the notification and report form; 

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) |

not participate in any meeting or discussion (whether in person, by phone or
otherwise) with a Governmental Entity in respect of any Required Regulatory
Approval unless it consults with the other Party in advance and gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend thereat (except (a) where the timing of
the response requested by the Governmental Entity does not reasonably permit
such review, (b) the Governmental Entity expressly requests that the other
Party should not be present at the meeting or discussion or part or parts of
the meeting or discussion, or (c) where competitively or commercially
sensitive information may 

---|---|--- -  40  - 



      |

 be discussed, in which case, with respect to meetings and discussions with
the Governmental Entity, every effort will be made to allow external legal
counsel to participate).  

---|---

this Section 4.4 to the other Party (the "Receiving Party") that the
Supplying Party deems to be competitively or commercially sensitive

or agree to enter into any acquisition or other corporate transaction, whether
directly or indirectly, after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of

reasonably likely to (i) materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity,
including the Required Regulatory Approvals, necessary to be obtained prior
to the Effective Date, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement, (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) otherwise prevent or

reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the Required Regulatory Approvals
as soon as practicable and in any event by no later than the Outside Date. For

negotiations with, and otherwise co-operate with or assist, such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and may provide copies of, access to or
disclosure of any information, properties, facilities, books or records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person, if and only if: 

---|--- 



     | (i) |

the Board first determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to
a Superior Proposal;

     | (ii) |

such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of its
obligations under this Article 5;  

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

such Person was not restricted from making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to an existing standstill or similar restriction; 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

prior to providing any such copies, access or disclosure, (a) the Company
enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms that are no
less favourable to the Company than those of the Confidentiality Agreement,

provided  

---|---|--- -  52  - 



      |

 to such Person shall have already been (or shall simultaneously be) provided
to the Purchaser; and 

---|--- 



     | (v) |

prior to providing any such copies, access or disclosure to such Person, the
Company provides the Purchaser with a true, complete and final executed copy
of the confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.3(1)(iv). 

---|---|--- 



   (2) |

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board or the Company
from making any disclosure to the Company Securityholders (i) if the Board,
acting in good faith and upon the advice of its legal advisors, shall have
first determined that the failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board or such disclosure is
otherwise required under applicable Law or (ii) or as required by applicable
Law, including in response to an Acquisition Proposal (including by responding
to an Acquisition Proposal in a directors circular); provided
that, notwithstanding that the Board or the Company shall be permitted to
make such disclosure, the Board shall not be permitted to make a Change in
Recommendation, other than as permitted by Section 5.4(1). Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board from calling and/or
holding a meeting of Common Shareholders requisitioned by Common Shareholders

Section 5.4 Right to Match

 



   (1) |

If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board determines, in
good faith, constitutes a Superior Proposal prior to the approval of the
Arrangement Resolution in accordance with the Interim Order, the Board may,
subject to compliance with Article 7 and Section 8.2, authorize the Company to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal or
may make a Change in Recommendation, if and only if: 

---|--- 



     | (i) |

the Person making the Superior Proposal was not restricted from making such
Superior Proposal pursuant to an existing standstill or similar restriction; 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of its
obligations under this Article 5;  

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

the Company has delivered to the Purchaser a written notice of the
determination of the Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Board to enter into such
definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or to make a
Change in Recommendation (a "Superior Proposal Notice"); 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

the Company has provided the Purchaser with a copy of the proposed definitive
agreement for the Superior Proposal (if any) and all supporting materials
supplied to the Company in connection therewith, including the value in
financial terms that the Board has, with its financial advisors, determined
should be ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered under the Superior
Proposal; 

---|---|--- -  53  - 



      | (v) |

at least five Business Days have elapsed from the date that is the later of
the date on which the Purchaser received the Superior Proposal Notice and the
date on which the Purchaser received all of the materials set forth in Section
5.4(1)(iv) (the "Matching Period"); 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) |

after the Matching Period, the Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (if
applicable, compared to the terms of the Arrangement as proposed to be amended
by the Purchaser under Section 5.4(2)); and  

---|---|--- 



     | (vii) |

prior to or concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(iii)(b) and pays
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2. 

---|---|--- 



   (2) |

During the Matching Period, or such longer period as the Company may approve
in writing for such purpose: (i) the Purchaser shall have the opportunity
(but not the obligation), to offer to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement
in order for such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal;
(ii) the Board shall review any offer made by the Purchaser to amend the
terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement, in consultation with outside
legal and financial advisors and in good faith, to determine whether such
proposal would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal
previously determined to constitute a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a
Superior Proposal; and (iii) if the Board determines that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with the Purchaser to make such amendments to the
terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable the Purchaser to
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on such amended
terms. 

---|--- 
 



   (3) |

Each successive amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal that
results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of
such consideration) to be received by the Company Securityholders or other
material terms or conditions thereof shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal for the purposes of this Section 5.4 and the Purchaser shall be
afforded a new Matching Period in connection therewith, provided that,
notwithstanding Section 5.4(1)(v) above, the duration of such Matching Period
shall be three Business Days rather than five Business Days.  

---|--- 



   (4) |

The Board shall promptly reaffirm the Board Recommendation by press release
after any Acquisition Proposal that is determined not to be a Superior
Proposal if the Board determines that a proposed amendment to the terms of
this Agreement as contemplated under Section 5.4(2) would result in an
Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal. The Company shall
provide the Purchaser and its legal counsel the reasonable opportunity to
review the form and content of any such press release and shall make all
reasonable amendments to such press release as requested by the Purchaser and
its legal counsel. 
 -  54  - 



    (5) |

If the Company provides a Superior Proposal Notice to the Purchaser on a date
that is less than ten Business Days before the Company Meeting, the Company
shall be entitled to, and the Purchaser shall be entitled to require the
Company to, adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to a date that is not more
than ten Business Days after the date of the Superior Proposal Notice;
provided, however, that the Company Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date later than the seventh Business Day prior to the Outside
Date. 

---|---

Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Article 5 by the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Article 5 by the Company.

_[Execution and Binding Obligation]_ of Schedule D hereto shall be true and

(other than Paragraph (3)(e)) and Paragraph (8)(e) of Schedule D hereto and

Existing Credit Facilities as of the Effective Date shall not exceed

Purchaser than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter such that the

the event that such additional debt financing can be arranged on such terms,
the condition in this Section 6.2(6) shall then be deemed to be satisfied.

Company

   (1) |

Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the

correct as of the Effective Time, as if made at and as of the Effective Time

officers (without personal liability), confirming same.

Purchaser. For greater certainty, in no event shall the Company be obligated

different events.

applicable Laws to deduct or withhold any Taxes from the payment of the
Termination Fee, (i) the Company shall make such required deductions or
withholdings, (ii) the Company shall remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable
Laws, and (iii) the amount so withheld and remitted shall be treated for
purposes of this Section 8.2 as having been paid to CDP Groupe Infrastructures

If a Reverse Termination Fee Event occurs, the Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Company the Reverse Termination Fee in accordance with Section

this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(iii)(a) _[Purchaser

following such Reverse Termination Fee Event). Any Reverse Termination Fee
shall be paid, or caused to be paid, by the Purchaser to the Company by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company. For greater certainty, in no event shall the Purchaser be obligated
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether the
Reverse Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to one or more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the

---|--- 



   (9) |

Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
without these agreements the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any
such amounts are excessive or punitive. If the Company or the Purchaser, as
the case may be, fails to timely pay any 
 -  64  - 



      |

 amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, it shall also pay any costs and
expenses incurred by the other Party in connection with a legal action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for the
payment of the Termination Fee, together with interest on the amount of any
unpaid fee, cost or expense at the prime rate of the Bank of Canada from the
date such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date. In no event shall, (i) the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) the Purchaser be obligated
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee (including as a consequence of payment
thereof by the Equity Investors pursuant to the Guarantee) on more than one
occasion, in each case, whether or not the Termination Fee or the Reverse
Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable at different times or upon the
occurrence of different events.

Subject to the Companys right to injunctive and other equitable relief or
other form of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.6 to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce compliance
with the terms of this Agreement and the indemnification or reimbursement
obligations of the Purchaser under Section 2.4(5), Section 4.8(3) or Section
4.11(1), in the event that the Reverse Termination Fee is paid to the Company
in circumstances for which such fee is payable, payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee (including as a consequence of payment thereof by the Equity
Investors pursuant to the Guarantee) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and its Subsidiaries against the Purchaser or any of its former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, financing
sources (including, without limitation, the Debt Financing Sources and the
Equity Investors), managers, members, directors, officers or affiliates
(collectively, the "Purchaser Related Parties") for any loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Arrangement or the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform any obligations
required to be performed under this Agreement or otherwise relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Arrangement, and upon payment of such
amount none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Arrangement,
and no Company Related Party shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against any Purchaser Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Guarantors shall
be obligated pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Guarantee). 

---|--- 



   (12) |

Subject to the Purchasers right to injunctive and other non-monetary
equitable relief or specific performance in accordance with Section 8.6 to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and the reimbursement
obligations of the Company under Section 8.2(10), in the event that the
Termination Fee is paid to the Purchaser in circumstances for which such fee
is payable, payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of any Purchaser Related Parties against the Company or any of its
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, financing
sources, managers, members, directors, officers or affiliates (collectively,
the "Company Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Arrangement or the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform all obligations required to
be performed under this Agreement or otherwise relating to or 
 -  65  - 



      |

 arising out of this Agreement or the Arrangement, and upon payment of such
amount none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or

damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against any Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

---|--- 



   (13) |

If this Agreement has been terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
7.2(1)(iv)(a) _[Company Breach]_ , then the Company shall, within two (2)
business days after receipt from Purchaser of documentation supporting its
reasonably incurred expenses in connection with this Agreement, pay to CDP
Groupe Infrastructures Inc. (or to any of its affiliates as directed by
notice in writing by CDPQ) up to $3,000,000 on account of its reasonably
incurred and documented expenses in connection with this Agreement. For
greater certainty, no amount shall be payable under this Section 8.2(13) in
the event that the Termination Fee is paid and in no event shall the sum of
the reimbursed expenses under this Section 8.2(13) and the Termination Fee
payable by the Company exceed an amount equal to the Termination Fee.

day on which it was delivered or, in the case of notices or other
communications transmitted by facsimile or email, transmitted (or if such day

a Partys legal counsel as contemplated above is for information purposes only
and does not constitute delivery of the notice or other communication to that
Party. The failure to send a copy of a notice or other communication to legal
counsel does not invalidate delivery of that notice or other communication to
a Party.

 

Section 8.4 Time of the Essence

 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.5 Further Assurances

 

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, from time to
time, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all such further
documents and instruments, as the other Party may, either before the Effective
Date, reasonably require to effectively carry out or better evidence or
perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement and, in the event the
Arrangement becomes effective, to document or evidence any of the transactions
or events set out in the Plan of Arrangement.

 

Section 8.6 Injunctive Relief



   (1) |

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, and to enforce compliance with the terms of 
 -  67  - 



      |

 this Agreement (including the Parties obligations to consummate the
Arrangement and the Purchasers obligation to pay, and the right of the
Company Securityholders to receive, the aggregate amount payable by the
Company and the Purchaser contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement) without any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties shall not object to the granting of injunctive or other
equitable relief on the basis that there exists an adequate remedy at law.
If, prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any action in accordance with
this Section 8.6 to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereby by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended (i) for the period during which such action is pending, plus 20
Business Days or (ii) by such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, as the case may be. 

---|--- 
 



   (2) |

For greater certainty, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance as a third party beneficiary of the
Purchasers rights against the Equity Investors under the Equity Commitment
Letter and/or to seek specific performance to cause the Purchaser to enforce
the obligations of the Equity Investors, under the Equity Commitment Letter,
as set out in Section 8.6(1); provided, however, that such right shall only be
available if, and only if: (i) all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
have been satisfied or waived by the applicable Party or Parties (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Effective Date,
but are reasonably capable of being satisfied by the Effective Date); (ii) the
Purchaser fails to consummate the Arrangement on the date on which the
Effective Date should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.9(2); (iii) the Debt
Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (or any alternative
financing to the Debt Financing contemplated by Section 4.8) has been funded
or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof on the Effective Date
if the Equity Financing is funded on the Effective Date; and (iv) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or any alternative financings thereto
contemplated by Section 4.8) are funded, it is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may concurrently
pursue both (i) a grant of specific performance as a third party beneficiary
of the Purchasers rights against the Equity Investors under the Equity
Commitment Letter, to seek specific performance to cause the Purchaser to
enforce the obligations of the Equity Investors, under the Equity Commitment
Letter and/or to consummate the Arrangement, in each case, to the extent
permitted by this Section 8.6(2) and (ii) the payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(6) (and the payment of any amounts
pursuant to Section 2.4(5), Section 4.8(3) or Section 4.11(1)); provided that
under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both (a) a
grant of specific performance as a third party beneficiary of the Purchasers
rights against the Equity Investors under the Equity Commitment Letter, to
seek specific performance to cause the Purchaser to enforce the obligations
of the Equity Investors, under the Equity Commitment Letter and/or to
consummate the Arrangement, in each case, to the extent permitted by this
Section 8.6(2) and (b) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 8.2(6)(and the payment of any amounts pursuant to Section 2.4(5),
Section 4.8(3) or Section 4.11(1)). 
 -  68  - 



 

Section 8.7 Third Party Beneficiaries

 



   (1) |

Except as provided in Section 2.4(5), Section 4.8(3), Section 4.10, Section
4.11(1) and Section 8.14, which, without limiting their terms, are intended
as stipulations for the irrevocable benefit of the Indemnified Persons and of
the other Persons identified therein as the beneficiaries thereof, and except
for the right of the Common Shareholders to receive the Consideration and the
right of the holders of Incentive Securities and Company Debentures to receive
the amount payable in respect thereof in connection with the Arrangement, in
each case, following the Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Company and the Purchaser intend that this Agreement will
not benefit or create any right or cause of action in favour of any Person
other than the Parties and that no Person, other than the Parties, shall be
entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any Proceeding or
other forum. 

---|--- 



   (2) |

Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of the Indemnified
Persons and each of the other Persons identified as being entitled to
indemnification in Section 2.4(5), Section 4.8(3), Section 4.10 and Section
4.11(1), their direct rights against the applicable Party under Section
2.4(5), Section 4.8(3), Section 4.10 and Section 4.11(1), which are intended
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and
each such other Person, his or her heirs and his, her or its legal
representatives, and for such purpose, the Company and the Purchaser, as
applicable, confirms that it is acting as trustee on their behalf, and agrees
to enforce such provisions on their behalf and that such provisions shall be
binding on the Purchaser and its successors. The Parties reserve the right to
vary or rescind their rights at any time and in any way whatsoever, if any,
granted by or under this Agreement to any Person, including any Indemnified
Person. 

---|--- 
 



   (3) |

Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of the Debt Financing
Sources their direct rights under Section 8.1, Section 8.2(11), Section 8.7,
Section 8.12(3), (4) and (5) and Section 8.17, which are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Debt Financing Sources, his or
her heirs and his or her legal representatives, and for such purpose, the
Company and the Purchaser, as applicable, confirms that it is acting as
trustee on their behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their behalf
and that such provisions shall be binding on the Purchaser and its
successors. 

---|--- 

Section 8.8 Waiver

 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Partys
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

 

Section 8.9 Entire Agreement

 

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee,
constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated -  69  - 



 

 by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties. There
are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other
agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between
the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement. The Parties have not relied and are
not relying on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering
into and completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 Successors and Assigns



   (1) |

This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by the Company and the
Purchaser. After that time, it will be binding upon and enure to the benefit
of the Company and the Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. 

---|--- 



   (2) |

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this
Agreement are assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party, provided that the Purchaser may assign all
or part of its rights under this Agreement to, and all or part of its
obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, any of its affiliates if
the Purchaser continues to be liable jointly and severally with such affiliate
for all of its obligations hereunder. 

---|--- 
 

Section 8.11 Severability

 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be
severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 8.12 Governing Law



   (1) |

This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein. 

---|--- 



   (2) |

the courts of Ontario in the City of Toronto and waives objection to the
venue of any Proceeding in such court or that such court provides an
inconvenient forum, provided that any court Proceedings will be conducted in
the English language.

The consideration contemplated by Section 4.1(1) shall be held by the

---|--- 



   (5) |

Any certificate, agreement or other instrument that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares or Company Debentures
not duly surrendered with all other documents required by this Section 4.1(1)
on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to
represent a claim by or interest of any former holder thereof of any kind or
nature against or in the Company or the Purchaser. On such date, all
consideration to which such former holder was entitled under the Plan of
Arrangement shall be deemed to have been surrendered to the Purchaser
or Company, as applicable, together with all entitlements to dividends,
distributions and interest thereon held for such former holder.

---|--- 
 



A-10  this Plan of Arrangement for such Incentive Security, less any amounts
withheld pursuant to Section 4.4 hereof.

applicable, pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement that has not been deposited
or has been returned to the Depositary or the Company, as applicable, or that
otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, and any right or claim to payment hereunder that
remains outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall cease
to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of the

threshold amounts redacted; provided that the Purchaser represents and
warrants that the redacted provisions in such fee letters do not permit the
imposition of any new conditions (or the expansion of any existing conditions)
with respect to the Debt Financing or any reduction in the amount of the Debt
Financing) and customary fee credit letters or engagement letters, in each
case, with respect to the Debt Financing (none of which adversely affect the

contemplated and (ii) no event has occurred or circumstance exists, including
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach on the part of the Purchaser under either the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Equity Commitment Letter. Each of the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Equity Commitment Letter, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, the other parties thereto,
in each case, except as may be limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally, and (B) general principles of equity,
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
As of the date hereof, assuming satisfaction of the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective Time, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Effective Time), the
Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that the Financings will not be
made available to the Purchaser on the Effective Date, including any reason
that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth
in either the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter not
being satisfied; that would constitute a material breach of any term or
condition of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter by any
party thereto; or that would make the Purchaser unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter. All commitment and other
fees or expenses required to be paid under or in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter and/or the Equity Commitment Letter on or prior to the date
hereof have been paid. At the Effective Date, assuming the Financings
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter
are funded, the Purchaser will have sufficient funds available to satisfy
the aggregate Consideration for the Common Shares and any other amounts
payable to the Company Securityholders by the Purchaser and the Company in
connection with the Arrangement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(the "Required Amount"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will
continue to provide, that the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof,
and is entitled to enforce such agreement, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof.

---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding any provision of this letter agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser hereby agrees and acknowledges that the undersigned is executing
this letter agreement and is bound hereunder solely in his or her capacity as
a securityholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
limit or affect any actions the undersigned may take in his or her capacity
as a director or officer of the Company or limit or restrict in any way the
exercise of his or her fiduciary duties as director or officer of the Company
including, without limitation, responding in his or her capacity as a director
or officer of the Company to an Acquisition Proposal and making any

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that (a) this Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered and is a valid and binding agreement,
enforceable against the undersigned in accordance with its terms, and the
performance by the undersigned of its obligations hereunder will not
constitute a violation or breach of or default under, or conflict with,
any contract, commitment, agreement, understanding or arrangement of any kind
to which the undersigned will be a party and by which the undersigned will be
bound at the time of such performance, and (b) he or she has been afforded the
opportunity to obtain independent legal advice and confirms by the execution
of this Agreement that they have either done so or waived their right to do so
in connection with the entering into of this Agreement, and that any failure
on the undersigneds part to seek independent legal advice shall not affect
(and the undersigned shall not assert that it affects) the validity,
enforceability or effect of this Agreement or the Arrangement Agreement.

 

For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the undersigned
from, directly or indirectly, selling, transferring, pledging or assigning or
agreeing to sell, transfer, pledge or assign any of the Holder Securities or
any interest therein, following the Company Meetings.

 

This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the

into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, (c) the
