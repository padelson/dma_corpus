consistent with the audited Financial Statements (except for the absence of

Company has no Indebtedness, liabilities or obligations, whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise, including any liability or obligation on

and consistent with the     16  23  Company\'s historical collection
experience. Any prepayments of revenue received by the Company have been

not shown or required to be shown on the Tax Returns referred to in
subsection (a)), have been or will have been paid or withheld in full on or
before the Closing Date, including but not limited to all deposits of payroll
taxes required or customarily made by the Company. The Financial Statements
for 1999 and 2000 reflect an adequate reserve for all material unpaid Taxes
payable by the Company and for all material accrued Taxes of the Company for
all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such statements
(excluding amounts that are attributable to timing differences between book
and tax income and also excluding normal fiscal year-end adjustments and
accruals). Any unpaid Taxes of the Company for all periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date will be included in the Unpaid Taxes (except as provided
in Section 2.3(a)(1)(D).   (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates

transferee or successor, (iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.   (f)
Neither Civic nor any of its Affiliates has: (i) any income or gain
reportable for a period ending after the Closing Date but attributable to a
transaction (e.g., an installment sale) occurring in, or a change in
accounting method made for, a taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date which resulted in a deferred reporting of income or gain
from such transaction or from such change in accounting method, (ii) any
income or gain that has been deferred as a result of having arisen out of any
"intercompany transaction," within the meaning of Section 1.1502-13(b) of the
Treasury Regulations, or (iii) any "excess loss account," within the meaning
of Section 1.1502-19(a) of the Treasury Regulations, in the stock of any

any of such Consents;   (e) Books and Records. Maintain the books and
records of the Company in accordance with past practices;   (f)

any of the information contained in the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3 or in the schedules hereto;   (g)

month between the date hereof and the Closing Date a statement of income and
expense of the Company for the month just ended, and (iii) such

is customarily prepared, or obtainable with reasonable effort, by the
Company. All financial information delivered by the Company or Sellers to
Buyer pursuant to this Section shall be prepared from the books and records
of the Company in accordance with past practices, shall accurately reflect
the books, records, and accounts of the Company and the Stations, shall be
complete and correct in all material respects, and shall present fairly the
financial condition of the Company and the Stations as at their respective
dates and the results of operations for the periods then ended;   (h)

respects at the Closing Date. The Company shall maintain customary levels of
marketing and promotion efforts and expenditures;   (j) Indebtedness,

other obligations and liabilities as they become due, consistent with past
practices, so that all such obligations and liabilities shall be current
as of the Closing Date, and (iv) prior to Closing (and notwithstanding

liabilities (including legal and accounting fees and other professional
expenses) that shall have been incurred by the Company (A) other than in the
ordinary course of business, (B) with respect to the Lawsuit, or the tax
audit of the Company\'s 1997 federal income tax return, or (C) with respect

thereto as of the date thereof, and of any powers of attorney for the
Company. No change in such accounts or deposits, persons authorized to sign

written notification thereupon being given to Buyer;   (o) New Contracts.
Not more than ten (10) nor fewer than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date, deliver to Buyer a list of all Contracts entered into between
the date     29  36  hereof and the date of such delivery of the type
required to be listed in Schedule 3.9, together with complete copies of such
Contracts (including all amendments, exhibits, schedules, and annexes
thereto), and Schedule 3.9 shall be considered to be amended by such list
except that such amendment to Schedule 3.9 shall not include the addition of
any Contract (or any amendment or modification thereto) that has been entered
into by the Company in breach of any covenant set forth in this Section 5.
The Company shall continue to seek film and programming license agreements in
the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that the Company\'s
ability to enter into any such agreements that shall be binding upon the
Company after Closing shall be subject to Buyer\'s prior approval to
the extent required under the terms of Section 5.1 hereof.   SECTION 6:
SPECIAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS   6.1 FCC Consent.   (a) The parties
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, no later than
August 1, 2000, all applications required to be filed with the FCC to obtain
any FCC Consent. The parties shall thereafter prosecute such applications
with all reasonable diligence and otherwise use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a grant of such applications as expeditiously as
practicable. Each party agrees to comply with any condition imposed on it by
the FCC Consent, except that no party shall be required to comply with a
condition if compliance with the condition would have a material adverse
effect upon it (with any adverse changes to the FCC\'s grant of continued
authority to operate KTRE-TV as a satellite station of KLTV-TV being
considered material). The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the
application for the FCC Consent and any requests for reconsideration
or judicial review of the FCC Consent.   (b) If the Closing shall not have
occurred for any reason within the original effective period of the FCC
Consent, and neither party shall have terminated this Agreement under Section
9, the parties shall jointly request an extension of the effective period of
the FCC Consent. No extension of the effective period of the FCC Consent
shall limit the exercise by either party of its right to terminate the
Agreement under Section 9.   6.2 HSR Act Filing. The parties hereto agree to
cause their "ultimate parent entity" to (a) file, or cause to be filed, with
the DOJ and FTC all filings, if any, which are required in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act within thirty (30)
business days of the date of execution of this Agreement; (b) cooperate with
each other in connection with such HSR Act filings, which cooperation shall
include furnishing the other with any information or documents in such
party\'s possession that may be reasonably required in connection with such
filings; (c) furnish each other with any correspondence from or to, and
notify each other of any other communications with, the FTC or DOJ which
relates to the transactions contemplated hereunder; and (d) to the extent
practicable, permit each other to participate in any conferences with the FTC
or DOJ.   6.3 Risk of Loss. The risk of any loss, damage,
impairment, confiscation, or condemnation of any of the assets of the Company
from any cause whatsoever shall be borne by the Company at all times prior to
the Closing. In the event of any such loss, damage,     30 
37  impairment, confiscation or condemnation, the Company shall be entitled
to receive, retain and use any and all insurance proceeds, recoveries, awards
or similar payment of monies from third parties to restore or otherwise
repair such affected item, which shall not be performed without Buyer\'s
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.   6.4 Confidentiality. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
and except (i) as necessary for the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) for disclosure as may be necessary
to comply with applicable law, each party will keep confidential any
information obtained from the other party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Civic agrees on behalf of itself and the Company
that Buyer may disclose information regarding the Company that would
otherwise not be subject to disclosure under the Confidentiality Agreement,
to Wachovia Bank, First Union National Bank, and Bank of New York; provided
that Buyer agrees to inform each such party of the nonpublic nature of such
information and to direct each such party to treat such information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement
is terminated or the transaction contemplated hereby is otherwise not
consummated, each party will return to the other party all
information obtained by such party from the other party in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Buyer agrees not to disclose any facts,
circumstances or other information concerning the Lawsuit, including the
treatment of the Lawsuit under this Agreement or the Tower Lawsuit Agreement;
provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not be breached by (i) the
inclusion of an attachment of a copy of this Agreement in any necessary
governmental filings, or (ii) such disclosure as shall be required by
applicable Legal Requirements.   6.5 Press Releases. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 8 of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties agree that Buyer is permitted to disclose to third
parties the existence of this Agreement and the fact that discussions have
been taking place, as necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of
the New York Stock Exchange; provided that Buyer will consider the Company\'s
input as to the required timing and content of such disclosure. Subject to
Sections 6.4 and 6.5, all other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect.   6.6 Cooperation. The parties shall
cooperate fully (and Civic shall cause TV-3, Inc. and LicenseCo to cooperate
fully) with each other and their respective counsel and accountants in
connection with any actions required to be taken as part of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, and the parties shall execute such other
documents as may be necessary and desirable to the implementation and
consummation of this Agreement, and otherwise use their commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby and to
fulfill their obligations under this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor any Seller
shall take any action that is inconsistent with its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect or that could reasonably be expected
to hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, neither party shall have any obligation
(a) to expend funds to obtain any of the Consents except as shall be
reasonably necessary by the Company to comply with the express terms of any
License or Contract regarding which any such Consent shall be requested, or
(b) to     31  38  agree to any adverse change in any License or
Contract in order to obtain a Consent required with respect thereto.   6.7
Control of the Stations. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall not, directly or
indirectly, control, supervise, or direct, or attempt to control, supervise
or direct the operations of the Stations; those operations,
including complete control and supervision of all of the Stations\' programs,
employees, and policies, shall be the sole responsibility of Sellers and the
Company.   6.8 Tax Matters.   (a) "UNPAID TAXES" means only federal, state
or local taxes imposed on or measured by net income or a tax base in the
nature of net income of the Company (including State of Texas Franchise Tax
without regard to method of computation) that are unpaid as of the Closing
Date, but that shall become due and payable and for which a Tax Return has
not been filed and the tax paid with respect to any and all tax periods of
the Company as to which a return is required ("REPORTING PERIOD") (i) ending
prior to the Closing Date ("PRIOR PERIOD"); (ii) ending with the Closing Date
as its last day ("CLOSING PERIOD"); and (iii) beginning prior to and ending
after the Closing Date ("STRADDLE PERIOD") as provided herein; provided,
however, that Unpaid Taxes shall exclude Taxes that have been customarily
included by the Company in "accrued expenses" on its balance sheet included
in its Financial Statements. Unpaid Taxes shall be determined by reference to
the final Tax Return filed (including any amendments and any adjustments
agreed with any tax authority) in the case of Reporting Periods as to which a
return has been filed prior to the date of the completion of the Audit
provided in Section 6.9. In the case of Reporting Periods as to which a
return is not required to be filed by the date of completion of the Audit
provided in Section 6.9, Unpaid Taxes will be determined as part of
the Audit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of
applicable tax law, Unpaid Taxes shall be deemed to include an amount equal
to the Tax Benefit (as defined and adjusted below) resulting from the fact
that a full year of deduction constituting an "adjustment" under Section 481
of the Code (a "481 ADJUSTMENT DEDUCTION") may be allowed to the Company for
the Closing Period on its United States federal income tax return for the
Closing Period, despite the fact that the Closing Period will constitute
fewer that 365 days. For purposes of this Section 6.8(a), the term "TAX
BENEFIT" shall mean a dollar amount equal to a portion of any Tax refund
received by the Company, or reduction in Taxes payable by the Company,
resulting directly from a 481 Adjustment Deduction claimed on the Company\'s
United States federal income tax return for the Closing Period (a "CLAIMED
481 ADJUSTMENT DEDUCTION"), such portion being calculated as the amount of
such Tax Benefit that would not have occurred if the amount of the Claimed
481 Adjustment Deduction had instead been equal to the product of (i) the
Claimed 481 Adjustment Deduction, times (ii) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days constituting the Closing Period, and
the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365). The parties agree
that to the extent professional fees are or become payable to Deloitte and
Touche, LLP under that certain letter agreement with the Company, dated May
21, 1998 (the "LETTER AGREEMENT"), that are attributable to any Prior Period
or Closing Period, or that are attributable to that portion of any Straddle
Period apportioned to Sellers in accordance with Section 6.8(b), but are
unpaid as of the Closing Date, such unpaid fees shall constitute an Unpaid
Tax; provided, however, that to the extent any such fees (i) are attributable
to a 481 Adjustment Deduction that results in a Tax Benefit included in the
Adjustment Items, then the amount of such Tax Benefit taken into account in
determining an Adjustment Item     32  39  under Section 2.3(a)(1)(D)
shall be reduced by the amount of such attributable fees, or (ii) are treated
as an Unpaid Tax and result in a reduction in the Purchase Price, but are
later refunded, reimbursed, or otherwise paid back to the Company, directly
or indirectly, then the Company and/or Buyer shall pay to Sellers the full
amount of any such refund, reimbursement or payment. Unpaid Taxes shall
comprise an Adjustment Item in determining the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.3 hereof; provided, however, that Unpaid Taxes arising under the
terms of the preceding three sentences (dealing with 481
Adjustment Deductions and related professional fees) shall be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Purchase Price only at the time that the Tax Benefit
results in a refund of Taxes or payment of reduced Taxes, which Tax Benefit
may be retained by Buyer or the Company in satisfaction of Sellers\' duty to
pay that portion of such Adjustment Item.   (b) Taxes of the Company with
respect to any Prior Period and any Closing Period (other than Unpaid Taxes
included in an Adjustment Item) shall be the responsibility of Sellers,
except that Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any Taxes that have
been customarily included by the Company in "accrued expenses" on its balance
sheet included in its Financial Statements. As to any Straddle Period,
responsibility for Taxes of the Company, other than Unpaid Taxes, shall be
apportioned between Buyer and Seller. The portion of such Taxes that is
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income or gross
receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case
of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or gross
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credits relating to
a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable
period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the
past practice of the Company. Except as set forth in Section 6.8(b)(1), Taxes
of the Company attributable to any Reporting Period commencing after the
Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer.   (1) Subject to the
terms of Section 10 hereof, Sellers agree to pay and, notwithstanding any
disclosure of potential tax liabilities made by Sellers or the Company, to
indemnify, reimburse, and hold harmless Buyer and the Company and their
respective successors, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, and representatives, from and against any and all Taxes of the
Company payable with respect to, and any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable
professional fees (with any professional fees paid under fee arrangements
entered into by the Company prior to Closing being hereby deemed reasonable)
incurred in the investigation, defense or settlement of any claims covered by
this indemnity) ("TAX DAMAGES"), arising out of, or in any manner incident
to, relating to, or attributable to Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Company with respect to any Prior Period, any Closing Period and any Straddle
Period as set forth in Section 6.8(b), except that with respect to any such
Reporting Period, Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of such Taxes
only to the extent that they exceed Unpaid Taxes as provided in
Section 6.8(a). Sellers agree to pay and, notwithstanding any disclosure of
potential tax liabilities made by Sellers or the Company, to indemnify,
reimburse, and hold harmless Buyer and the Company and their respective
successors, and their respective officers, directors,     33 
40  employees, agents, and representatives, from and against any and all Tax
Damages arising out of, or in any manner incident to, relating to or
attributable to any final adjustment by a Governmental Authority of the tax
liability, tax attributes or reported tax information of the Company as set
forth in, or otherwise underlying, the Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Company with respect to any Prior Period, any Closing Period, and any
Straddle Period as provided in Section 6.8(b) (such damages, together with
the Tax Damages described in the preceding sentence, the "INDEMNIFIABLE TAX
DAMAGES"). All Indemnifiable Tax Damages are subject to the terms,
procedures, and limitations regarding claims for indemnification contained in
Section 10 hereof, and nothing in this Section 6.8 is intended to create an
obligation to indemnify any party claiming indemnification other than as
provided by Section 10 hereof.   (2) Except as set forth in Section 6.8(d)
below, Sellers shall be entitled to any credits or refunds of Taxes of the
Company (including any refunds, reimbursements or other payments from
Deloitte and Touche, LLP of fees paid under the Letter Agreement) payable with
respect to any Prior Period, any Closing Period and any Straddle Period as
set forth in Section 6.8(b), including without limitation carryforwards of
tax credits and net operating losses to such periods, provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be entitled to any credits
or refunds which are attributable to the carryback of net operating losses
from Reporting Periods beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause
the amount of any credits or refunds of Taxes to which Sellers are entitled
under this Section 6.8, but which are received by or credited to the Company
or its successors after the Closing Date, to be paid to Sellers within ten
(10) business days following such receipt or crediting, provided that such
payment shall be net of any Tax Damages incurred by the Company with respect
thereto, and provided further that Sellers shall reimburse the Company or its
successors to the extent of any required subsequent repayment of, or
reduction in, the amount of such credits or refunds of Taxes so received or
credited.   (3) Sellers shall also indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
the Company from and against any and all Taxes of Sellers for any and all
periods, whether before or after the Closing Date, and from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Tax Damages arising out of or in any manner
incident, relating or attributable to such Taxes or to Tax Returns filed or
required to be filed by Sellers.   (4) Buyer agrees to pay and to
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless Sellers and their successors, and
their officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, from and
against any and all Taxes of the Company payable with respect to, arising out
of, or in any manner incident to, relating to, or attributable to Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company with respect to any Reporting Period of
the Company beginning after the Closing Date and any Straddle Period as set
forth in Section 6.8(b).   (c) Any tax sharing agreement, practice, or other
similar arrangement between or among any of the Company and the Sellers shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date.   (d) Any amounts owed by Sellers to
any party under this Section 6.8 shall be paid within ten (10) business days
of notice from such party; provided that if Sellers have not paid such
amounts and such amounts are being contested before the appropriate
Governmental Authorities in good faith, Sellers shall not be required to make
payment until it is determined     34  41  finally by an appropriate
Governmental Authority or court that payment is due, provided that Sellers
take prudent and appropriate action to protect such party from (i) the
immediate imposition of a lien that arises or attaches from nonpayment after
assessment and demand of such amounts, or (ii) seizures of assets. Any
amounts owed by Buyer to any party under this Section 6.8 shall be paid
within ten (10) business days of notice from such party; provided that
if Buyer has not paid such amounts and such amounts are being contested
before the appropriate Governmental Authorities in good faith, Buyer shall
not be required to make payment until it is determined finally by an
appropriate Governmental Authority or court that payment is due if Buyer
takes prudent and appropriate action to protect such party from (i) the
immediate imposition of a lien that arises or attaches from nonpayment after
assessment and demand of such amounts, or (ii) seizures of assets.   (e)
The Tax liabilities for each Closing Period for the Company shall be
determined by closing the books and records of the Company as of the Closing
Date, by treating such Closing Period as if it were a separate Reporting
Period, and by employing accounting methods which are consistent with those
employed in preparing the Tax Returns for the Company in prior
Reporting Periods and which do not have the effect of distorting income or
expenses (taking into account the other provisions of and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), provided that with respect to any Tax which
is not in effect during the entire Closing Period, the proration of such Tax
shall be based on the period during the Closing Period that such Tax was in
effect.   (f) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Sellers will
provide Buyer with a schedule setting forth: (i) the tax basis of the assets
of the Company as of the Closing Date; and (ii) the net operating
loss carryover, investment tax credit carryover and the capital loss
carryover available, if any, to Buyer with respect to the Company (A) for
federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any other Taxes for which
the applicable Reporting Period ends on the Closing Date), as of the Closing
Date, and (B) for purposes of other Taxes, as of the first day of the
applicable Closing Period; and (iii) all federal, state and local tax
elections in effect for the Company as of the Closing Date.   (g) Buyer
shall promptly notify Sellers in writing of any notice, letter,
correspondence, claim, determination, decision or decree ("TAX CLAIM")
received by Buyer or the Company or their successors for any Reporting Period
that might raise a claim for indemnification hereunder. Buyer shall have the
sole right to handle, answer, defend, compromise or settle any Tax
Claim arising from Reporting Periods beginning after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers at the cost and expense solely of the
Sellers, shall have the option to handle, answer, defend, compromise, or
settle any Tax Claim that might raise a claim for indemnification hereunder,
but solely with respect to issues not affecting the Company with respect to
any Reporting Periods ending after the Closing Date and to the extent that
Buyer would be entitled to indemnification hereunder (and not with respect to
Indemnifiable Tax Damages which would exceed the then existing balance of the
Indemnity Fund less the total amount of all other pending indemnity claims to
which the Buyer is entitled); provided that the Buyer shall have the right to
(and shall promptly notify the Sellers as to whether it will) participate in
any Tax examination, audit, contest, or litigation in connection with such
Tax Claim; and further provided that Sellers may not compromise or settle any
Tax Claim giving rise to Indemnifiable Tax Damages, determined without regard
to net operating losses of the     35  42  Company, which exceed the
then existing balance of the Indemnity Fund less the total amount of all
other pending indemnity claims to which the Buyer is entitled, or which would
adversely affect the Company with respect to any Straddle Period or Reporting
Period beginning after the Closing Date without the written consent of the
Buyer, which will not be unreasonably withheld. If Sellers have not notified
Buyer that they elect to handle a Tax Claim pursuant to the foregoing
sentence within thirty (30) days of its receipt of notice of the respective
Tax Claim, then Buyer shall have the sole right to handle, answer, defend,
compromise, or settle such Tax Claim. Buyer shall cause the Company to give
promptly to Sellers any relevant information relating to such Tax Claim which
may be particularly within the knowledge of the Company and otherwise to
cooperate fully with Sellers in good faith with respect to such Tax Claim. If
Sellers fail within a reasonable time after notice to participate in any Tax
Claim or any examination, audit, contest or litigation as provided herein,
Sellers shall be bound by the results obtained by Buyer, or its successors or
assigns, in connection with such Tax Claim and such examination, audit,
contest or litigation.   (h) Sellers shall be responsible for preparing on
behalf of the Company all Tax Returns for Reporting Periods of the Company
ending on or before the Closing Date which have not been filed on or before
the Closing Date; provided, however, that such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in a manner which is consistent with the Audit materials prepared in
accordance with Section 6.9 of this Agreement, and shall not report any item
in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner in which any corresponding
item has been previously reported in any such Tax Return already filed,
unless such inconsistent treatment is (x) required by law or due to a change
in circumstances, or (y) is permitted by law, Sellers elect to make such

of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Sellers set forth in this
Agreement shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Sellers, and such

shall be in effect on the date that would otherwise be the Closing Date any
judgment, decree, or order that would prevent or make unlawful the Closing
and such judgment, decree or order shall not have been vacated, released or

judgment, decree or order is the result of facts or circumstances relating
primarily to Sellers or the Company, or arising primarily as a result of
Sellers\' or the Company\'s actions or omissions.   (c) Upset Date. Unless
the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a breach of this
Agreement by Sellers, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to

of such earlier date the FCC Consent shall not have been obtained and become
a Final Order.   (d) Breach of Agreement. If Buyer shall be in material
breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth

the Stock abandoned, after thirty (30) days\' (the "BUYER\'S TERMINATION
NOTICE PERIOD") prior written notice by Buyer to Sellers, upon the occurrence
of any of the following:     48  55   (a) Conditions. If on the date
that would otherwise be the Closing Date any of the conditions precedent to
the obligations of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall not have been

Buyer\'s Termination Notice Period, unless the failure of the condition
precedent to be satisfied is the result of a breach of this Agreement by
Buyer.   (b) Judgments. If there shall be in effect on the date that would
otherwise be the Closing Date any judgment, decree, or order that
would prevent or make unlawful the Closing and such judgment, decree or order
shall not have been vacated, released or enjoined within the Buyer\'s
Termination Notice Period, unless such judgment, decree or order is the
result of facts or circumstances relating primarily to Buyer, or arising
primarily as a result of Buyer\'s actions or omissions.   (c) Upset Date.
Unless the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a breach of this
Agreement by Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to
December 31, 2000, which date shall be extended to September 30, 2001, if as
of such earlier date the FCC Consent shall not have been obtained and become
a Final Order.   (d) Interruption of Service. If any event occurs that
(i) takes any of the Stations off-the-air for a period of five (5) days or
more or (ii) prevents a signal transmission by any of the Stations in the
normal and usual manner for a period of five (5) or more days after the date

event constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.   (e) Breach of Agreement. If
any Seller or the Company shall be in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, and such
breach shall not be cured prior to the later to occur of (i) the date that
would otherwise be the Closing Date, or (ii) the expiration of the Buyer\'s
Termination Notice Period.   9.3 Rights and Obligations on Termination. Upon
termination: (i) if none of the parties hereto is in material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall not have any further
obligations or liability to each other except as provided in this Section 9.3
and Section 9.4 hereof; (ii) if any Seller or the Company shall be in
material breach of any provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall have all
rights and remedies available at law or equity, including the right of
specific performance set forth in Section 9.5 hereof, provided, however, that
neither Seller nor the Company shall be liable to Buyer for monetary damages
in the absence of a bad faith or willful breach of this Agreement (with this
limitation having no effect upon Buyer\'s right of specific performance); or
(iii) if Buyer shall be in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Sellers
shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Amount as liquidated damages pursuant
to Section 9.3(d) hereof.   (a) Surviving Rights and Obligations. The rights
and obligations of the parties described in Sections 6.4, 9.3 through 9.6,
and 11.1 (and all other provisions of this Agreement relating to expenses)
will survive any termination.     49  56   (b) Withdrawal of
Applications. All filings, applications and other submissions relating to the
consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby shall, to the extent
practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority or other Person to
whom made.   (c) Return of Escrow Amount. If this Agreement is
terminated other than pursuant to the terms of Section 9.1(d), then and in
such event the Escrow Amount shall be returned to Buyer and if Sellers shall
be in breach of any of their obligations, representations, warranties or
covenants under this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to pursue all
legal or equitable remedies for breach of contract or otherwise, including
the remedy of specific performance as provided in Section 9.5.   (d)
Payment of Escrow Amount. If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant
to the terms of Section 9.1(d) (i.e., because of a material breach by Buyer
of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement), then and in that event, Civic shall have the right
to receive the Escrow Amount on behalf of the Sellers. The parties agree that
the amount of the actual damages suffered by Sellers as a result of a breach
by Buyer are likely to be difficult or impractical to ascertain and,
therefore, the payment of the Escrow Amount to Civic on behalf of the Sellers
(i) is a fair and reasonable amount to reimburse Sellers and the Company for
damages sustained due to Buyer\'s failure to consummate this Agreement and
(ii) does not constitute a penalty.   9.4 Escrow Deposit. Concurrent with
the execution hereof, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Buyer
has delivered the Escrow Deposit to the Escrow Agent to be held by the Escrow
Agent to secure Buyer\'s performance and fulfillment of its obligations under
this Agreement. All such funds deposited with the Escrow Agent shall be held
and disbursed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the
following provisions:   (a) Upon and subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, the Escrow Amount shall thereafter comprise a portion of the
Indemnity Fund, to be held thereafter by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the Indemnity Agreement.   (b) In the event of a termination of this
Agreement, the Escrow Amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 9.3
hereof.   9.5 Specific Performance. The parties recognize that if any Seller
or the Company refuses to perform under the provisions of this Agreement
or otherwise breaches this Agreement, monetary damages alone would not be
adequate to compensate Buyer for its injury. Buyer shall therefore be
entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, to obtain
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought
by Buyer to enforce this Agreement, Sellers and the Company shall waive the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.   9.6 Attorneys\' Fees. In
the event of a default by either party that results in a lawsuit or other
proceeding for any remedy available under this Agreement, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the other party of its
reasonable legal fees and expenses (whether incurred in arbitration, at
trial, or on appeal).     50  57   SECTION 10: SURVIVAL OF
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES;  INDEMNIFICATION; CERTAIN REMEDIES   10.1
Survival. All representations and warranties of Buyer, Sellers and the
Company herein shall be deemed continuing representations and warranties, and
shall survive the Closing, subject to the terms of this Section 10.
Any investigations by or on behalf of any party hereto shall not constitute a
waiver as to enforcement of any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement. No notice or information delivered by either
party shall affect the other party\'s right to rely on any representation,
warranty, or covenant made by such party or relieve such party of any
obligations under this Agreement as the result of a breach of any of its
representations and warranties.   10.2 Indemnification by Sellers.
Regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of Buyer or
any information Buyer may have, but subject to the limitations in this
Section 10, following Closing Sellers shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless
against and with respect to, and shall reimburse Buyer for:   (a) any and
all losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from any untrue representation,
breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any covenant by Sellers or the
Company contained herein or in any certificate, document, or instrument
delivered to Buyer hereunder; provided, however, that for purposes
of indemnity claims under this subsection (a), any qualifications of
materiality or Material Adverse Effect that may be expressed in any
representation or warranty by any Seller or the Company shall be disregarded
and given no effect;   (b) any and all losses, liabilities, or damages
resulting from the assertion of any claim or legal action against the Company
based upon, arising out of or relating to events occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date, except as described in clause (iv) of Section 3.19; and   (c)
any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, incident to any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand,
assessment, or judgment incident to the foregoing or incurred
in investigating or attempting to avoid the same or to oppose the
imposition thereof, or in enforcing this indemnity.   10.3 Indemnification
by Buyer. Regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of
Sellers or any information Sellers may have, but subject to the limitations
in this Section 10, following Closing Buyer shall indemnify and hold Sellers
harmless against and with respect to, and shall reimburse Sellers for:  
(a) any and all losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from any untrue
representation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any covenant by
Buyer contained herein or in any certificate, document, or
instrument delivered to Sellers hereunder; provided, however, that for
purposes of indemnity claims under this subsection (a), any qualifications of
materiality or knowledge which may be expressed in any representation or
warranty by Buyer shall be disregarded and given no effect; and     51 
58   (b) any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable
legal fees and expenses, incident to any action, suit, proceeding, claim,
demand, assessment, or judgment incident to the foregoing or incurred
in investigating or attempting to avoid the same or to oppose the
imposition thereof, or in enforcing this indemnity.   10.4 Procedure for
Indemnification. The procedure for indemnification shall be as follows:  
(a) The party claiming indemnification (the "CLAIMANT") shall promptly give
notice to the party from which indemnification is claimed (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") of any claim, whether between the parties or brought by a third
party, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis for the claim
and the amount of the claim. If the claim relates to an action, suit, or
proceeding filed by a third party against Claimant, such notice shall be
given by Claimant within five (5) business days after written notice of such
action, suit, or proceeding was given to Claimant.   (b) With respect to
claims solely between the parties, following receipt of notice from the
Claimant of a claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days to
make such investigation of the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems
necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the Claimant
agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party and its authorized
representatives the information relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate
the claim. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to
the expiration of such thirty(30) day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall immediately pay to the Claimant the full amount of the claim,
subject to the terms hereof and the terms of, and procedures set forth in,
the Indemnity Agreement. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do
not agree within such thirty (30) day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate remedy at law or
equity, as applicable.   (c) With respect to any claim by a third party as
to which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement,
the Indemnifying Party, subject to its acknowledgement of its indemnity
obligations hereunder, shall have the right at its own expense, to
participate in or assume control of the defense of such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense of any third-party
claim, the Claimant shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such claim at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume control or otherwise participate in the defense of any third-party
claim, the Claimant will not enter into any settlement of such claim which
could result in indemnification liability to the Indemnifying Party unless
the Claimant gives the Indemnifying Party ten (10) days\' prior written
notice of such settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does not thereupon elect
to assume the defense of such claim (with a written acknowledgment of
its indemnity obligations hereunder) within such ten (10) business days after
such notice is given, then the Claimant may enter into such settlement and
such settlement shall be binding upon Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be,
for purposes of determining whether any indemnification payment is required
pursuant to this Section 10. If the Indemnifying Party does elect to assume
control of the defense of any third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party may
not enter any settlement of such claim unless the Indemnifying Party gives
the Claimant prior written notice of the terms of such settlement, provided
that without the Claimant\'s prior written consent, the Indemnifying Party
shall not enter     52  59  any settlement which imposes or could
reasonably be expected to impose on the Claimant any current or future
liabilities or obligations for which it shall not be indemnified by
Indemnifying Party.   (d) If a claim, whether between the parties or by a
third party, requires immediate action, the parties will make every effort to
reach a decision with respect thereto as expeditiously as possible.   (e)
The indemnification rights provided in Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 shall
extend to the members, partners, stockholders, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, and affiliated entities of any Claimant although,
for the purpose of the procedures set forth in this Section 10.4,
any indemnification claims by such parties shall be made by and through
the Claimant.   10.5 Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither Buyer nor Sellers, as the case may be as
Indemnifying Parties, shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise be
liable to Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be as Claimant:   (a) except
regarding claims described in subsection (b) below and Section 10.7 below
(with respect to Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4(b) and 3.5(b)), with respect to any
claim by Buyer that the Sellers or the Company, or by Sellers that Buyer,
shall have breached its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement , or has failed to comply with its covenants contained herein which
are to be performed at or prior to Closing:   (1) unless notice of such
claim is given prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date;   (2)
unless and until the aggregate amount for which Buyer or Sellers, as the case
may be as Indemnifying Parties, would otherwise (but for this provision) have
been liable for on account of such claim and other claims for which Sellers
or Buyer, as the case may be as Claimant, shall not have been indemnified,
shall exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) and then only for
such excess, provided, however, that such threshold shall not apply with
respect to claims among the parties with respect to amounts owed under
Sections 2.4, 6.8 or 11.1, or with respect to the Lawsuit; and   (3) with
respect to any and all claims by Buyer as Claimant, only to the extent of the
balance of the Indemnity Fund (including any amounts being added thereto
pursuant to Section 10.7(b)).   (b) with respect to any claim by Buyer as
the Claimant that any Seller as an Indemnifying Party shall have breached its
representations or warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4(b) and 3.5(b), notice
of such claim is given to such Seller prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.   10.6 Recourse to Indemnity Fund . With
respect to any liability incurred by any Seller or Sellers to Buyer under
this Section 10, Buyer\'s sole recourse (except as provided in the
immediately following proviso) shall be to the Indemnity Fund (including any
amounts being added thereto pursuant to Section 10.7(b)); provided, however,
that in addition to the foregoing     53  60  and with personal
liability separate from the Indemnity Fund, (i) each Preferred Stockholder
shall be liable to Buyer under this Section 10 in connection with any breach
by such Preferred Stockholder (but not by other Preferred Stockholders) of
its representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1, and (ii) each
Seller shall be liable to Buyer under this Section 10 in connection with any
breach by such Seller (but not by other Sellers) of its representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.3, 3.4(b) and 3.5(b), but in no event
shall any Seller be liable to Buyer under this Section 10 for more than such
Seller\'s pro rata share of the Purchase Price (plus, if applicable, any
amounts received by such Seller pursuant to Section 6.15 and with respect
to the Civic Stock Options).   10.7 Indemnity Agreement. At the Closing,
Buyer, CS Agent (as agent for and on behalf of Sellers), PS Agent (as agent
for and on behalf of the Preferred Stockholders), and the Escrow Agent shall
execute the Indemnity Agreement, in accordance with which the Escrow Amount
shall become a portion of the Indemnity Fund as of Closing, with the amount
by which the Indemnity Fund as of Closing exceeds the Escrow Amount being
deposited with the Escrow Agent by Buyer at the Closing by federal wire
transfer of same-day funds. The Indemnity Fund shall thereafter be held by
the Escrow Agent in order to provide a fund for, and (subject to the
following proviso) the exclusive source for, the payment of any indemnity
claims to which Buyer is entitled under this Section 10; provided, however,
that the Indemnity Fund shall not be the exclusive source for the payment of
any such indemnity under this Section 10 arising in connection with the
breach by any Seller of its representations and warranties contained
in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4(b) and 3.5(b). The Indemnity Fund will be
administered in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and the
Indemnity Agreement. The following provisions shall govern the Indemnity
Fund:   (a) If any claim for indemnification by Buyer pursuant to
this Section 10 is resolved in favor of Buyer in accordance with the
procedures in Section 10.4, Buyer shall be entitled to receive from the
Indemnity Fund the lesser of the amount of its claim or the remaining amount
of the Indemnity Fund (including any amounts being added thereto pursuant to
Section 10.7(b)), and Buyer, the CS Agent, and the PS Agent will jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such amount to Buyer, as applicable.
Amounts disbursed to Buyer by the Escrow Agent shall be disbursed: (i) with
respect to any breach by any Seller of its representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4(b) and 3.5(b), solely from and as a
reduction to such Seller\'s share of the Indemnity Fund, and (ii) with
respect to any other claims for indemnification by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 10, from and as a pro-rata reduction to all of the Sellers\' shares
of the Indemnity Fund based upon the percentages set forth on Schedule 10.7.
In the event that with reference to clause (ii) above, any such disbursement
shall occur prior to the date on which the additional contributions to the
Indemnity Fund provided for in the second sentence of subsection (b) below
shall have occurred, each share of such disbursement that would have
come from an additional contribution yet to be made to the Indemnity Fund
shall not be disbursed to Buyer at such time but, instead, shall be disbursed
to Buyer from such additional contribution when it is made to the Indemnity
Fund, with Buyer, the CS Agent, and the PS Agent jointly instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse such share to Buyer.   (b) Schedule 10.7 sets
forth (i) each Seller\'s share of the Indemnity Fund as of Closing, (ii) the
additional amount to be contributed to the Indemnity Fund by the Company
or     54  61  the Trust with respect to each Option Holder upon the
Put or the Call of the Civic Stock Options, totaling, for all the Option
Holders, One Million Six Hundred Nineteen Thousand Two Hundred Seven Dollars
($1,619,207), and (iii) each Seller\'s percentage and dollar share of the
Indemnity Fund when fully funded. Upon the consummation of the Put or Call
with respect to each Option Holder, the Company or the Trust, whichever is
the party effecting payment with respect to such event, shall (A) deduct from
the amount of the payment to be made to such Option Holder, the amount of his
contribution to the Indemnity Fund set forth on Schedule 10.7 thereto, and
(B) make such contribution to the Indemnity Fund contemporaneously with the
distribution of the balance to such Option Holder.   (c) On the first
business day after the last to occur of (i) the date upon which the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3, (ii) the date ten (10)
business days following the completion of the Audit, and (iii) the date ten
(10) business days following the filing of the Company\'s Tax Returns in
accordance with Section 6.8, Buyer, the CS Agent, and the PS Agent will
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Sellers the amount by which
the Indemnity Fund shall then exceed the sum of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) plus the amount reasonably determined by Buyer to be
necessary to satisfy all pending indemnity claims, if any, made by Buyer
pursuant to this Section 10.   (d) On the first business day after the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date: Buyer, the CS Agent, and
the PS Agent will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Sellers
the amount by which the Indemnity Fund shall then exceed the sum of Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) plus the amount reasonably
determined by Buyer to be necessary to satisfy all pending indemnity claims,
if any, made by Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.   (e) On the first
business day after the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing
Date, Buyer, the CS Agent, and the PS Agent will jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Sellers the amount by which the Indemnity Fund shall
then exceed the amount reasonably determined by Buyer to be necessary to
satisfy all pending indemnity claims, if any, made by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 10.   (f) From time to time after the first business day on or
after the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, after
any indemnity claim by Buyer pursuant to this Section 10 shall be resolved
for which a portion of the Indemnity Fund shall have been reserved, Sellers
shall be entitled to receive from the Indemnity Fund the amount, if any, by
which the amount of the Indemnity Fund reserved for such indemnity claim
shall have exceeded the amount to which Buyer shall have been entitled to
receive upon the resolution of such claim, and Buyer, the CS Agent, and the
PS Agent will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such excess to
Sellers.   (g) Regarding amounts disbursed to Sellers under subsections (c)
through (f) above, except as set forth in the following sentence, any
amount disbursed to Sellers by the Escrow Agent shall comprise a pro-rata
reduction to all of the Sellers\' shares of the Indemnity Fund based upon the
percentages set forth on Schedule 10.7. However, with each such disbursed
amount being considered to be comprised of thirteen separate disbursements
(assuming the Henry Estate is a Seller), no disbursement to any Seller shall
be made that reduces such Seller\'s     55  62  then current share of
the Indemnity Fund below the higher of (i) the sum of the amounts reserved
against such share with respect to (A) claims for breach by such Seller of
its representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4(b) and
3.5(b), and (B) other claims for indemnification by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 10, reserved on a pro-rata basis among all of the Sellers based upon
the percentages set forth on Schedule 10.7, or (ii) zero ($0.00).   10.8
Reduction of Certain Benefits. Any insurance or other recovery, payment or
credit received by the Claimant from any third party that was not taken into
account in computing the amount of any payment hereunder shall promptly be
paid over to the Claimant up to the amount of the indemnity payment made by
the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto.   10.9 Subrogation Rights;
Right of Set-Off. In the event that Claimant has a claim for indemnification
hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall, upon payment of such claim in full,
be subrogated to all rights of the Claimant with respect to the Loss to which
such claim relates; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall only
be subrogated to the extent of any amount paid by it pursuant to this Section
10 in connection with such loss. Notwithstanding the terms of Section 10.7,
Buyer and Sellers, as an Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall each,
as "payor," have the right to set-off against amounts owed by such "payor" to
the other party(ies) as Claimant, any amounts owed by such other party(ies)
as the Indemnifying Party to such "payor" as Claimant.   10.10 Exclusive

exclusive remedy for all losses, liabilities, damages or expenses described
in Section 10.2 and 10.3 (including with respect to the breach of any

the provisions of this Agreement shall be limited to the exercise and
enforcement of the indemnity rights provided in this Section 10.   SECTION
