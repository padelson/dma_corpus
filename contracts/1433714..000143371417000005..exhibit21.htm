immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and

automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.4, a number of shares of Castlight Class B Common
Stock equal to the Series A Per Share Stock Consideration.

(B) Each share of Jiff Series B Preferred Stock held by a Converting Holder

Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares that are owned by Jiff
as treasury stock) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.4, a number of

the extent payable pursuant to the terms and conditions Annex A, the right to

(A) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, each Jiff Option and Employee RSU, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by an employee who, immediately following the
Effective Time, is a Continuing Employee shall be assumed by Castlight and
converted into (1) an option to purchase Castlight Class B Common Stock or (2)
a restricted stock unit that settles for Castlight Class B Common Stock,
respectively, subject to and conditioned upon the Continuing Employee agreeing
to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Waiver by executing and
delivering the same to Jiff and Castlight. Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, each assumed Jiff Option (each, an "Assumed Jiff Option")
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in Jiff Option Plan and Jiff Option agreement relating thereto as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) such Assumed
Jiff Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Castlight
Class B Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number
of shares of Jiff Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Jiff
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Castlight Class B Common
Stock, (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Castlight Class B
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Jiff Option shall be equal
to the per share exercise price set forth in such Continuing Employee's Equity
Waiver; and (C) each such Assumed Jiff Option held by a Continuing Employee
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Waiver entered into
by such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the exercise price of each Assumed Jiff Option, the number of shares of
Castlight Class B Common Stock issuable pursuant to each Assumed Jiff Option
and the terms and conditions of each Assumed Jiff Option shall in all events
be determined in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise
set forth in this Agreement, each assumed Employee RSU shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the 2017 Jiff
Option Plan and the restricted stock unit agreement underlying such Employee
RSU as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such
Employee RSUs shall settle for that number of whole shares of Castlight Class
B Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of
shares of Jiff Common Stock subject to such Employee RSU by the Common Per
Share Stock Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Castlight Class B Common Stock.

(B) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
effective as of the Effective Time, each Jiff Option (or portion thereof),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is (A) held by a Non-
Continuing Employee or any other Person other than a Continuing Employee or
(B) held by a Continuing Employee who has not executed and delivered an Equity
Waiver prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled without the payment of
any consideration.

(C) No Jiff Option held by a Continuing Employee shall have the vesting or the
lapse of any forfeiture, repurchase or similar restrictions, as applicable,
accelerate, whether by the terms of Jiff Option Plan, any applicable Jiff
Option agreement or grant, any applicable stock restriction agreement or other
agreement related thereto, or otherwise, in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions (either alone or in connection with any other event,
contingent or otherwise). (D) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the review and approval of
Castlight, Jiff shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.3(a) under Jiff Option Plan, all Jiff Option
agreements, any applicable stock restriction agreement or other agreement, or
any other plan or arrangement of Jiff (whether written or oral, formal or
informal), and Applicable Law, including adopting all resolutions, giving all
notices, obtaining consents from each holder of such Jiff Options and taking
any other actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate this Section
1.3(a). At the Effective Time, Jiff agrees to effect the termination of Jiff
Option Plan, subject to the review and reasonable approval of Castlight.

(v) Jiff Warrants. Each Jiff Warrant, whether vested or unvested, shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished and shall not be assumed by Castlight in the Merger.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall the aggregate number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock to be
issued by Castlight to Jiff Securityholders (including the Merger
Consideration, but excluding the Employee RSUs) exceed the Total Amount, less
a number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock (on a Castlight Stock
Price basis) equal to an amount in cash equal to the 50% of Transaction
Expenses.

(b) Treatment of Jiff Capital Stock Owned by Jiff. At the Effective Time, all
shares of Jiff Capital Stock that are owned by Jiff as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment of any cash or other property or
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Castlight, Merger Sub or any
other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Entity (and the shares
of the Surviving Entity into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock are
so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Entity's capital stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). From
and after the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of a
number of shares of Merger Sub capital stock will evidence ownership of such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Entity.

(d) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Jiff Capital Stock or
Castlight capital stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the
Effective Time, and with respect to the shares of Castlight Class B Common
Stock issued in the Earnout (if and when earned), occurring prior to such
issuance in the Earnout, all references herein to specified numbers of shares
of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for
that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading
prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change.

(e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall instead be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for
such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but
only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such
shares shall immediately be deemed to have converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares,
and Castlight shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as
promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times
specified in Section 1.4(a), following the satisfaction of the applicable
conditions set forth in Section 1.4(a), the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. Jiff shall
provide to Castlight (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or
purchase received by Jiff, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments related to such demands served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by Jiff and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands under the DGCL. Jiff shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Castlight, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, or as otherwise required under the DGCL,
voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting
Shares. Subject to Section 9.2, the payout of consideration under this
Agreement to the Converting Holders (other than in respect of Dissenting
Shares, which shall be treated as provided in this Section 1.3(e) and under
the DGCL) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of
appraisal rights under the DGCL by any other Jiff Stockholder.

(f) Rights Not Transferable. The rights of Jiff Securityholders under this
Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the right
to receive any Applicable Contingent Payments) are personal to each such Jiff
Securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason, other than by
operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution without action
taken by or on behalf of such Jiff Securityholder. Any attempted transfer of
such right by any holder thereof (other than as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

(g) Fractional Shares. The number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock
into which a Converting Holder's shares of Jiff Capital Stock are converted
pursuant to this Article I shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares
of Castlight Class B Common Stock to which any Converting Holder would
otherwise be entitled (after aggregating, for each particular stock
certificate representing Jiff Capital Stock or option grant, all fractional
shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock to be received by such holder), such
Converting Holder shall receive from Castlight an amount in cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the
Castlight Stock Price.

(h) No Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
interest shall accumulate on any cash payable or shares issuable in connection
with the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.

1.4 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Surrender of Certificates.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, to the extent
not previously delivered, Castlight shall mail, or cause to be mailed, a
letter of transmittal together with instructions for use thereof (the "Letter
of Transmittal") to every holder of record of Jiff Capital Stock that was
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Letter of
Transmittal shall specify that delivery of the certificates or instruments
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Jiff Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt thereof by Castlight (or, in the
case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, compliance with Section
1.4(a)(vi)), together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each Person effecting the surrender of
such Certificates, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Castlight may reasonably specify, including an agreement to be bound by the
provisions of Section 1.5 and Article IX and agree to release Jiff and the
Surviving Entity from any claims, rights, Liabilities and causes of action
whatsoever based upon, relating to or arising out of the Certificates, the
Merger and/or the other Transactions.

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Castlight shall
cause to be deposited with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC or
other bank or trust company as Castlight may choose in its discretion (the
"Exchange Agent") the portion of the Merger Consideration issuable to Jiff
Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of their shares of Jiff
Capital Stock, subject to Section 1.4(c).

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documentation required thereby,
(A) the holder of record of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive the
number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such Certificate,
less such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, and (B)
such Certificate shall be cancelled.

(iv) Any certificates or book-entry entitlements representing the shares of
Castlight Class B Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and in
the Escrow Fund shall, so long as such shares are in the Escrow Fund, bear the
following legends to the extent applicable (along with any other legends that
may be required under Applicable Law):

"THE SHARES EVIDENCED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO A RIGHT OF REPURCHASE AND/OR
INDEMNITY AND ESCROW OBLIGATIONS AS SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT WITH THE
COMPANY."



It is Castlight's current policy not to issue stock certificates representing
shares of its capital stock, and all new issuances of capital stock are
reflected on Castlight's books and records in book entry only, with
appropriate notations reflecting the applicable legends.



(v) Upon receipt of written confirmation of the effectiveness of the Merger
from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Castlight will instruct
the Exchange Agent to deliver to each Converting Holder the aggregate number
of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock issuable to such Converting Holder
pursuant to Section 1.3(a), less such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of
the Escrow Amount other than in respect of Dissenting Shares to holders
thereof, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five
Business Days, following the submission of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent
and a duly executed Letter of Transmittal by such Converting Holder.

(vi) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such document to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Castlight or the Exchange Agent,
the payment of any reasonable fees and the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amounts as Castlight may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
document, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed document the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration issuable
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of their shares of Jiff Capital Stock,
subject to Section 1.4(c).

(b) Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other
provisions of this Article I, Castlight shall withhold from each Converting
Holder's applicable portion of the Merger Consideration issuable to such
Converting Holder pursuant to Section 1.3(a) such Converting Holder's Pro Rata
Share of the Escrow Amount and deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow
Agent. For each Converting Holder that holds both vested and unvested shares
of Jiff Capital Stock, the shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock
contributed to the Escrow Fund shall consist of vested and unvested shares of
Castlight Class B Common Stock in the same ratio as such Converting Holders
ratio of vested and unvested Jiff Capital Stock, and any unvested shares of
Castlight Class B Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall vest before any
unvested shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock not in the Escrow Fund. The
Escrow Fund and the Set-Off Right shall constitute partial security for the
benefit of Castlight (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person)
with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification
obligations of the Converting Holders under Article IX, and shall be held and
distributed in accordance with Section 9.1. The adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the principal terms of the Merger by Jiff Stockholders shall
constitute, among other things, approval of the Escrow Amount, the withholding
of the Escrow Amount by Castlight and the appointment of the
Stockholders'Agent.

(c) Transfers of Ownership. If any share of Castlight Class B Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) is to be issued to a Person other than the
Person to which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to
Castlight or any agent designated by Castlight any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of such Certificate, or
established to the satisfaction of Castlight or any agent designated by
Castlight that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.4, no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Applicable Law.

(e) Unclaimed Consideration. Each holder of a Certificate who has not
theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by this Section 1.4 shall look only to Castlight (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar Applicable Law) for its claim, only as
a general unsecured creditor thereof, to any portion of the Merger
Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such
Certificate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the earlier of the first
anniversary of the Effective Time and such date on which the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to, or become the property
of, any Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Castlight, but thereafter remaining subject to any and all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.5 No Further Ownership Rights in Jiff Capital Stock, Jiff Options or Jiff
Warrants. The applicable portion of the Merger Consideration issued or
issuable following the surrender for exchange of the Certificates in accordance with this Agreement shall be issued or issuable
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Jiff Capital
Stock represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Entity of shares of
Jiff Capital that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Entity for any reason, such Certificate, document or instrument
(and the underlying shares of Jiff Capital Stock) shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

1.6 Tax Consequences. The parties hereto intend, by executing this Agreement,
to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 354(a)(1) and
368(a)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3, and to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; it being understood and agreed that
neither Castlight nor the Merger Sub nor Jiff makes any representations or
warranties to Jiff or to any Jiff Securityholder regarding the Tax treatment
of the Merger, or any of the Tax consequences to Jiff or to any Jiff
Securityholder of this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions or the
other agreements contemplated by this Agreement. Jiff acknowledges that Jiff
and the Jiff Securityholders will be relying solely on their own Tax advisors
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and
the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement.

and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the applicable Jiff
Securityholders when due, and each Jiff Securityholder shall, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees.

1.8 Withholding Rights. Each of Castlight, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any issuances of

Stock, Jiff Options, Jiff Warrants or Certificates, such shares of Castlight
Class B Common Stock as Castlight, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such issuances under
the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been issued to such Persons in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

1.9 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full right,
title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Jiff, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity are fully authorized, in the name and on
behalf of Jiff or otherwise, to take all lawful action necessary or desirable
to accomplish such purpose or acts, so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

shares upon termination of employment or service, and (ii) to the knowledge of
Jiff (without inquiry or investigation of any third parties), between or among

corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Jiff

at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Jiff Preferred Stock and Jiff
Starter Stock (voting together as a single voting class on an as-converted to
Jiff Common Stock basis) are the only votes of the holders of Jiff Capital
Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the principal terms of the
Merger under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, each
as in effect at the time of such adoption and approval (collectively, the
"Jiff Stockholder Approval").

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Jiff
Transaction Documents, by Jiff does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions will not, (i) result in the creation of any Encumbrance on any of
the material assets of Jiff, or to the knowledge of Jiff (without inquiry or
investigation of any third parties), any of the shares of Jiff Capital Stock
or (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss
of any material benefit under, or require any consent, approval or waiver from
any Person pursuant to, (A) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation,
the Bylaws or other equivalent organizational or governing documents of Jiff,
in each case as amended to date, (B) any Material Contract or (C) any
Applicable Law.

(c) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,

the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws, and (iii) such other consents,
approvals, Orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and
notices that, if not obtained or made, would not adversely affect, and would
not reasonably be expected to adversely affect, Jiff's ability to perform or
comply with the covenants, agreements or obligations of Jiff herein or in any
other Jiff Transaction Document or to consummate the Transactions in
accordance with this Agreement or any other Jiff Transaction Document and
Applicable Law.

(d) Jiff, the Jiff Board and Jiff Stockholders have taken all actions such
that the restrictive provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination," "interested shareholder" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation, and any anti-takeover provision
in the organizational or governing documents of Jiff will not be applicable to
any of Castlight, Jiff or the Surviving Entity, or to the execution, delivery,
or performance of this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement, or to the
Transactions, Jiff Stockholder Approval or the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

2.4 Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) Jiff has made available to Castlight its audited financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2015 and its unaudited financial statements for
the 10-month period ended October 31, 2016 (including, in each case, balance
sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows) (collectively,
the "Financial Statements"), which are included as Schedule 2.4(a) of the Jiff
Disclosure Letter. The Financial Statements (i) are derived from and in
accordance with the books and records of Jiff, (ii) complied as to form with
applicable accounting requirements with respect thereto as of their respective
dates, (iii) fairly and accurately present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of Jiff at the dates therein indicated and
the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Jiff for the periods
therein specified (subject, in the case of unaudited interim period financial
statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments, none of which
individually or in the aggregate are or will be material in amount) and (iv)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for the absence of footnotes in
the unaudited Financial Statements, applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved.

(b) Jiff has no Liabilities of any nature other than (i) those set forth or
adequately provided for in the balance sheet included in the Financial
Statements as of October 31, 2016 (such date, the "Jiff Balance Sheet Date"
and such balance sheet, the "Jiff Balance Sheet"), (ii) those incurred in the
conduct of Jiff's business since Jiff Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice, (iii) those incurred by Jiff in
connection with the execution of this Agreement, (iv) those that are executory
performance obligations arising under Contracts to which Jiff is a party or
otherwise bound (that, in the case of Material Contracts, do not result from a
breach or default thereunder) or (v) those that are immaterial to Jiff. Except
for Liabilities reflected in the Financial Statements, Jiff has no off-balance
sheet Liability of any nature to, or any financial interest in, any third
parties or entities, the purpose or effect of which is to defer, postpone,
reduce or otherwise avoid or adjust the recording of expenses incurred by
Jiff. All reserves that are set forth in or reflected in Jiff Balance Sheet
have been established in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. The
Financial Statements comply in all material respects with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 985-605. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Jiff has never guaranteed any debt
for borrowed money of any other Person. For clarity, the mere existence of a
claim, complaint or notice from a third party involving Jiff arising after the
Agreement Date shall not constitute a breach of this Section 2.4(b) based
solely on the theory that such claim or the matters underlying such claim
(absent an underlying breach of another applicable representation, warranty or
covenant) constitute a contingent, unmatured or other Liability of Jiff.

(c) Schedule 2.4(c) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
Agreement Date, a true, correct and complete list of all Jiff Debt, including,
for each item of Jiff Debt, the agreement governing Jiff Debt and the interest
rate, maturity date, any assets securing such Jiff Debt and any prepayment or
other penalties payable in connection with the repayment of such Jiff Debt at
the Closing.

(d) Schedule 2.4(d) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter sets forth the names and
locations of all banks and other financial institutions at which Jiff
maintains accounts and the names of all Persons authorized to make withdrawals
therefrom.

(e) The accounts receivable of Jiff (the "Accounts Receivable") as reflected
on Jiff Balance Sheet and as will be reflected in Jiff Closing Financial
Certificate arose in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales and other
charges, and have been collected or to the knowledge of Jiff, are collectible
in the book amounts thereof within 60 days following the Agreement Date, less
an amount not in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts provided for in
Jiff Balance Sheet or in Jiff Closing Financial Certificate, as the case may
be. Allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and in accordance with Jiff's
past practice and are to the knowledge of Jiff, sufficient to provide for any losses that may be sustained on realization of the
applicable Accounts Receivable. The Accounts Receivable arising after Jiff
Balance Sheet Date and before the Closing Date (i) arose or shall arise in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) represented or
shall represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales and other charges
and (iii) have been collected or are to the knowledge of Jiff collectible in
the book amounts thereof within 60 days following the Closing Date, less
allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns determined in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied and Jiff's past practice that to the knowledge
of Jiff, are or shall be sufficient to provide for any losses that may be
sustained on realization of the applicable Accounts Receivable. As of the
Agreement Date, none of the Accounts Receivable is subject to any claim of
offset, recoupment, set-off or counter-claim and, to the knowledge of Jiff,
there are no facts or circumstances (whether asserted or unasserted) that
could give rise to any such claim. No material amount of Accounts Receivable
is contingent upon the performance by Jiff of any obligation or Contract other
than normal warranty repair and replacement. No Person has any Encumbrance on
any Accounts Receivable, and no agreement for deduction or discount has been
made with respect to any such Accounts Receivable. Schedule 2.4(e) of the Jiff
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, an aging of the
Accounts Receivable in the aggregate and by customer, and indicates the
amounts of allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns. Schedule
2.4(e) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the Agreement Date,
such amounts of Accounts Receivable that are subject to asserted warranty
claims by customers and reasonably detailed information regarding asserted
warranty claims made within the last year, including the type and amounts of
such claims.

(f) Jiff has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i) that transactions,
receipts and expenditures of Jiff are being executed and made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Jiff Board,
(ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to maintain
accountability for assets, (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Jiff and (iv)
that the amount recorded for assets on the books and records of Jiff is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. None of Jiff and, to the
knowledge of Jiff, Jiff's independent auditors, any current or former
employee, consultant or director of Jiff, has identified or been made aware of
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves Jiff's management or other
current or former employees, consultants directors of Jiff who have a role in
the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by Jiff, or any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.
None of Jiff and, to the knowledge of Jiff, any Representative of Jiff has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material written
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, in each case, regarding deficient
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Jiff
or its internal accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in Jiff's
financial statements. No attorney representing Jiff, whether or not employed
by Jiff, has reported to the Jiff Board or any committee thereof or to any
director or officer of Jiff evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Jiff or its
Representatives. There are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the design or operation of Jiff's internal controls that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect Jiff's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data. At Jiff Balance Sheet Date, there were no material
loss contingencies (as such term is used in Financial Accounting Standards
Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450) that are not adequately
provided for in Jiff Balance Sheet as required by such Topic 450. There has
been no change in Jiff accounting policies since December 31, 2015, except as
described in the Financial Statements.

2.5 Absence of Changes. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
from the Jiff Balance Sheet Date to the Agreement Date, (i) Jiff has conducted
the Jiff Business only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (ii) there has not occurred any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Jiff and (iii) Jiff has not done, caused or permitted any action that would
constitute a breach of Section 5.2 if such action were taken by Jiff, without
the written consent of Castlight, between the Agreement Date and the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time.

2.6 Litigation. As of the Agreement Date, there is no Legal Proceeding to
which Jiff is a party pending before any Governmental Entity, or, to the
knowledge of Jiff, threatened in writing against Jiff or any of its assets or
any of its directors, officers or employees (in their capacities as such or
relating to their employment, services or relationship with Jiff). As of the
Agreement Date, there is no Order against Jiff, any of its assets, or, to the
knowledge of Jiff, any of its directors, officers or employees (in their
capacities as such or relating to their employment, services or relationship
with Jiff). To the knowledge of Jiff, there is no reasonable basis for any
Person to assert a claim against Jiff or any of its assets or any of its
directors, officers or employees (in their capacities as such or relating to
their employment, services or relationship with Jiff) based upon: (i) Jiff
entering into this Agreement, any of the Transactions or the agreements
contemplated by this Agreement, including a claim that such director, officer
or employee breached a fiduciary duty in connection therewith or (ii) any
claim that Jiff has agreed to sell or dispose of any of its assets to any
party other than Castlight, whether by way of merger, consolidation, sale of
assets or otherwise; provided that for clarity, this sentence will not be
deemed to address general contract non-contravention (which is addressed by
Section 2.3(b)(ii)(B)). As of the Agreement Date, Jiff does not have any Legal
Proceeding pending against any other Person.

2.7 Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no Contract or Order
addressed to and binding upon Jiff that restricts or prohibits, purports to
restrict or prohibit, has or would reasonably be expected to have, whether
before or after consummation of the Merger, the effect of prohibiting,
restricting or impairing any current business practice of Jiff, any
acquisition of property by Jiff, or the conduct or operation of the Jiff
Business or, excluding restrictions on the use of Third-Party Intellectual
Property contained in the applicable written license agreement therefor,
limiting the freedom of Jiff to (i) engage or participate, or compete with any
other Person, in any line of business, market or geographic area with respect
to Jiff Products or Jiff Intellectual Property, or to make use of any Jiff
Intellectual Property, including any grants by Jiff of exclusive rights or
licenses or (ii) sell, distribute or manufacture any products or services or
to purchase or otherwise obtain any software, components, parts or services.

any material respect of, and has not received any notices of violation with
respect to, Applicable Law.

(b) Jiff has obtained each material federal, state, county, local or foreign
governmental consent, license, permit, grant or other authorization of a
Governmental Entity (i) pursuant to which Jiff currently operates or holds any
interest in any of its assets or properties or (ii) that is required for the
conduct of the Jiff Business or the holding of any such interest (all of the
foregoing consents, licenses, permits, grants and other authorizations,
collectively, the "Jiff Authorizations"), and all of Jiff Authorizations are
in full force and effect. As of the Agreement Date, Jiff has not received any
written notice or, to the knowledge of Jiff, other communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding (i) any actual or possible violation of any Jiff
Authorization or (ii) any actual or possible revocation, withdrawal,
suspension, cancellation, termination or modification of any Jiff
Authorization, and to the knowledge of Jiff (without inquiry or investigation
of any Governmental Entity), no such notice or other communication is
forthcoming. Jiff has materially complied with all of the terms of Jiff
Authorizations and none of Jiff Authorizations will be terminated or impaired,
or will become terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the
consummation of the Transactions. 2.9 Title to, Condition and Sufficiency of Assets; Real Property.

of its tangible properties, and interests in tangible properties and assets,
real and personal, reflected on Jiff Balance Sheet or acquired after Jiff

and assets, sold or otherwise disposed of since Jiff Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), or, with respect
to leased tangible properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in such
properties and assets that afford Jiff valid leasehold possession of the
properties and assets that are the subject of such leases, in each case, free
and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances and liens
securing indebtedness that is reflected on the Jiff Balance Sheet.

(b) The tangible assets and properties owned or licensed by Jiff (i)
constitute all of such assets and properties that are necessary for Jiff to
conduct, operate and continue the conduct of the Jiff Business and to sell and
otherwise enjoy full rights to exploitation of such assets and properties and
(ii) constitute all of such assets and properties that are used in the conduct
of the Jiff Business, without (A) the need for Castlight to acquire or license
any other tangible asset or property or (B) the breach or violation of any
Material Contract.

(c) Schedule 2.9(c) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter identifies each parcel of
real property leased by Jiff. Jiff has made available to Castlight true,
correct and complete copies of all leases, subleases and other agreements
under which Jiff uses or occupies or has the right to use or occupy, now or in

amendments and supplements thereto. Jiff does not currently own any real

consultant, advisor or independent contractor of Jiff: (i) is in violation of

disclosure, invention assignment, non-disclosure or non-competition or any

performing services for, Jiff or using trade secrets or proprietary
information of others without permission or (ii) has developed any technology,
software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for

technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work. Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement will
conflict with or result in a breach by Jiff of the terms, conditions or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, any Contract of the type

to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all confidential or non-public

Information have executed and delivered to Jiff a written legally binding
agreement regarding the protection of such Confidential Information. Jiff has
implemented and maintains reasonable security, disaster recovery and business
continuity plans consistent with industry practices of companies offering
similar services, and acts in compliance therewith and has tested such plans
on a periodic basis, and such testing has not revealed any material
deficiencies. To the knowledge of Jiff, Jiff has not experienced any breach of
security or otherwise unauthorized access by third parties to the Confidential
Information, including Personal Data in Jiff's possession, custody or control.

(i) Non-Infringement. To the knowledge of Jiff, there is no unauthorized use,
unauthorized disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Jiff-Owned
Intellectual Property by any third party. Jiff has not brought any Legal
Proceeding for infringement or misappropriation of any Jiff-Owned Intellectual
Property. Jiff has no Liability for infringement or misappropriation of any
Third-Party Intellectual Property. The operation of the Jiff Business,
including (i) the design, development, manufacturing, reproduction, marketing,
licensing, sale, offer for sale, importation, distribution, provision and/or
use of any Jiff Product and/or Jiff-Owned Intellectual Property and (ii)
Jiff's use of any product, device, process or service used in the Jiff
Business as previously conducted, currently conducted and as proposed to be
conducted by Jiff, has not, does not and will not infringe (directly or
indirectly, including via contribution or inducement), misappropriate or
violate any Third-Party Intellectual Property, breach any terms of service,
click-through agreement or any other agreement or rules, policies or
guidelines applicable to use of such Third-Party Intellectual Property, and
does not constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the
Applicable Law of any jurisdiction in which Jiff conducts its business or in
which Jiff Products are manufactured, marketed, distributed, licensed or sold
and there is no basis for any such claims. Jiff has not been sued in any Legal
Proceeding or received any written communications (including any third-party
reports by users) alleging that Jiff has infringed, misappropriated, or
violated or, by conducting the Jiff Business, would infringe, misappropriate,
or violate any Intellectual Property of any other Person or entity. No Jiff-
Owned Intellectual Property is subject to any Legal Proceeding, Order, or
settlement agreement that restricts in any manner the use, transfer or
licensing thereof by Jiff, or that may affect the validity, use or
enforceability of any Jiff-Owned Intellectual Property. Jiff has not received
any written opinion of counsel that any Jiff Product or Jiff-Owned
Intellectual Property or the operation of the business of Jiff, as previously or currently conducted, or as currently proposed to be conducted, infringes or
misappropriates any Third-Party Intellectual Property.

independent contractors with respect to the development or assignment of Jiff-
Owned Intellectual Property, which agreements satisfy the requirements set

(i) Jiff is not (and will not be as a result of the execution and delivery or
effectiveness of this Agreement or the performance of Jiff's obligations under
this Agreement), in breach of any Jiff Intellectual Property Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions will not result in the modification of, or
give rise to any rights of cancellation, termination, suspension of, or
acceleration of any payments, rights, obligations or remedies with respect to
any Jiff Intellectual Property Agreements, or give any non-Jiff party to any
Jiff Intellectual Property Agreement the right to do any of the foregoing;

(ii) to the knowledge of Jiff, no counterparty to any Jiff Intellectual
Property Agreement is in breach thereof;

(iii) at and after the Closing, the Surviving Entity (as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Castlight) will be permitted to exercise all of Jiff's rights

been able to had the Transactions not occurred and without the payment of any
additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or
payments that Jiff would otherwise be required to pay;

(iv) to the knowledge of Jiff, there are no disputes or Legal Proceedings

has ownership or license rights to improvements or derivative works made by
Jiff in the Third-Party Intellectual Property that has been licensed to Jiff.

(l) Non-Contravention. None of the execution and performance of this

Castlight or any of its Affiliates granting to any third party any right to or
with respect to any Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed to,
Castlight or any of its Affiliates, (ii) Castlight or any of its Affiliates,
being bound by or subject to, any exclusivity obligations, non-compete or

Person or agreed or obligated itself to disclose, deliver or license to any
Person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other
Person of, any Jiff Source Code, other than disclosures to employees,

and (ii) subject to a written confidentiality agreement. No event has
occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to,
result in the disclosure, delivery or license by Jiff of any Jiff Source Code,
other than disclosures to employees and consultants involved in the
development of Jiff Products. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the
execution nor performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the
Transactions will result in a release from escrow or other delivery to a third
party of any Jiff Source Code.

(n) Open Source Software. Schedule 2.10(n) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter
identifies all Open Source Materials incorporated or embedded in or combined
with any Jiff Products, describes whether such Open Source Materials were
modified and/or distributed by Jiff, identifies the licenses under which such
Open Source Materials were used and discloses how Jiff's proprietary code
interacts with any open source licensed under the Affero GPL or similar
"network viral" license. Jiff is in compliance with the terms and conditions
of all licenses for such Open Source Materials. Jiff has not (i) incorporated
Open Source Materials into, or combined Open Source Materials with, Jiff-Owned
Intellectual Property or Jiff Products, (ii) distributed Open Source Materials
in conjunction with any Jiff-Owned Intellectual Property or Jiff Products or
(iii) used Open Source Materials, in such a way that, with respect to clauses
(i)-(iii), creates, or purports to create, obligations for Jiff with respect
to any Jiff-Owned Intellectual Property or grant, or purport to grant, to any
third party any rights or immunities under any Jiff-Owned Intellectual
Property (including Jiff using, modifying, or distributing any Open Source
Materials that require, as a condition of such use, modification and/or
distribution of such Open Source Materials that other software incorporated
into, derived from or distributed with such Open Source Materials be (A)
disclosed or distributed in source code form, (B) be licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works or (C) be redistributable at no charge).

(o) Information Technology.

(i) Status. The arrangements relating to the ICT Infrastructure (including its
operation and maintenance and any amendments or modifications thereto) will
not be adversely affected by the Transactions, and the ICT Infrastructure will continue to be
available for use by Jiff immediately following the consummation of the
Transactions and thereafter on substantially the same terms and conditions as
prevailed immediately before the Closing, without further action or payment by
Castlight. Jiff is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the ICT
Infrastructure and the ICT Infrastructure is used exclusively by Jiff. The ICT
Infrastructure that is currently used in the Jiff Business constitutes all the
information and communications technology infrastructure and systems
reasonably necessary to carry on the Jiff Business as currently conducted,
including having sufficient capacity and maintenance and support requirements
to satisfy the requirements of the Jiff Business as currently conducted with
regard to information and communications technology, data processing and
communications.

(ii) No Faults. Jiff has not experienced, and to the knowledge of Jiff, no
circumstances exist that are likely or expected to give rise to, any material
disruption in or to the operation of the Jiff Business as a result of: (A) any
substandard performance or defect in any part of the ICT Infrastructure
whether caused by any viruses, bugs, worms, software bombs or otherwise, lack
of capacity or otherwise or (B) a breach of security in relation to any part
of the ICT Infrastructure.

(iii) ICT Agreements. All Contracts relating to the ICT Infrastructure are
valid and binding and no Contract (including any Contract for Third-Party
Intellectual Property) that relates to the ICT Infrastructure has been the
subject of any breach by Jiff or, to the knowledge of Jiff, any other Person,
and Jiff (A) has not waived any breach thereof by any other Person, (B) has
not received any notice of termination of any such Contract and (C) is not
aware of any circumstances that would give rise to a breach, suspension,
variation, revocation or termination of any such Contract without the consent
of Jiff (other than termination in accordance with the terms of such
Contract).

(p) Privacy and Personal Data.

(i) Jiff's data, privacy and security practices conform, and at all times have
conformed, to all of Jiff Privacy Commitments, Privacy Laws and Jiff Data
Agreements. Jiff has at all times: (i) provided adequate notice and obtained
any necessary consents from end users required for the Processing of Personal
Data as conducted by or for Jiff and (ii) abided by any privacy choices
(including opt-out preferences) of end users relating to Personal Data, in
each case to the extent required by Applicable Law (such obligations along
with those contained in Jiff Privacy Policies, collectively, "Jiff Privacy
Commitments"). Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will cause, constitute, or
result in a breach or violation of any Privacy Laws or Jiff Privacy
Commitments, any Jiff Data Agreements or standard terms of service entered
into by users of Jiff Products. Copies of all current and prior Jiff Privacy
Policies have been made available to Castlight and such copies are true,
correct and complete.

(ii) Jiff has established and maintains appropriate technical, physical and
organizational measures and security systems and technologies in compliance
with all data security requirements under Privacy Laws and Jiff Privacy
Commitments that are designed to protect Jiff Data against accidental or
unlawful Processing in a manner appropriate to the risks represented by the
Processing of such data by Jiff and its data processors. Jiff has taken
commercially reasonable steps (a) to ensure the reliability of its employees
and data processors (and their employees) that have access to Jiff Data, (b)
to train such employees and data processors on applicable aspects of Privacy
Laws and Jiff Privacy Commitments and (c) to ensure that all employees and
data processors with the right to access such data are under written
obligations of confidentiality with respect to such data. (iii) No breach, security incident or violation of any data security policy in
relation to Jiff Data has occurred or is threatened, and there has been no
unauthorized or illegal Processing of any Jiff Data. No circumstance has
arisen in which: (i) Privacy Laws would require Jiff to notify a Governmental
Entity of a data security breach or security incident or (ii) applicable
guidance or codes of practice promulgated under Privacy Laws would recommend
Jiff to notify a Governmental Entity of a data security breach.

(iv) Jiff has not received or experienced and, to the knowledge of Jiff, there
is no circumstance (including any circumstance arising as the result of an
audit or inspection carried out by any Governmental Entity) that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, any Legal Proceeding, Order, written
notice, written communication, warrant, regulatory opinion, audit result or
written allegation from a Governmental Entity or any other Person (including
an end user): (A) alleging or confirming non-compliance with a relevant
requirement of Privacy Laws or Jiff Privacy Commitments, (B) requiring or
requesting Jiff to amend, rectify, cease Processing, de-combine, permanently
anonymize, block or delete any Jiff Data (except where Jiff has complied with
such requirement or request), (C) permitting or mandating relevant
Governmental Entities to investigate, requisition information from, or enter
the premises of, Jiff in connection with Jiff's breach or alleged breach of
Privacy Laws, Jiff Privacy Commitments or any other security incident or (D)
claiming compensation from Jiff with respect to Jiff's breach or alleged
breach of Privacy Laws, Jiff Privacy Commitments or any other security
incident. Jiff has not been involved in any Legal Proceedings involving a
breach or alleged breach of Privacy Laws or Jiff Privacy Commitments.

(v) Schedule 2.10(p)(v) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter contains the complete
list of notifications and registrations made by Jiff under Privacy Laws with
relevant Governmental Entities in connection with Jiff's Processing of
Personal Data. All such notifications and registrations (including Jiff's
certification under the US-Switzerland Safe Harbor and the US-EU Privacy
Shield Framework) are valid, accurate, complete and fully paid up and, to the
knowledge of Jiff, the consummation of the Transactions will not invalidate
such notification or registration or require such notification or registration
to be amended. Other than the notifications and registrations set forth on
Schedule 2.10(p)(v) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter, no other registrations or
notifications under Privacy Laws with any Governmental Entity are required in
connection with the Processing of Personal Data by Jiff.

(vi) Where Jiff uses a data processor to Process Personal Data, the processor
has provided guarantees, warranties or covenants in relation to Processing of
Personal Data, confidentiality, security measures and compliance with those
obligations that are sufficient for Jiff's compliance with Privacy Laws and
Jiff Privacy Commitments, and there is in existence a written Contract between
Jiff and each such data processor that is sufficient for Jiff's compliance
with Privacy Laws and Jiff Privacy Commitments. Jiff has made available to
Castlight true, correct and complete copies of all such Contracts. To the
knowledge of Jiff, such data processors have not breached any such Contracts
pertaining to Personal Data Processed by such Persons on behalf of Jiff.

(vii) Jiff has not transferred or permitted the transfer of Personal Data
originating in the EEA outside the EEA, except where such transfers have
complied with the requirements placed on Jiff by Privacy Laws and Jiff Privacy
Commitments, including Jiff's certification under the US-Switzerland Safe
Harbor and US-EU Privacy Shield Framework. (viii) Schedule 2.10(p)(viii) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter identifies and
provides a high-level description of the repositories or databases containing
(in whole or in part) materially all Jiff Data maintained by or for Jiff at
any time (the "Jiff Databases").

(ix) Jiff has valid and subsisting contractual rights to Process or to have
Processed (in the manner that it is Processed by or for Jiff) all third-party-
owned data howsoever obtained or collected by or for Jiff (all such data,
"Jiff-Licensed Data"). Jiff has all rights, and all permissions or
authorizations required under Privacy Laws and relevant Contracts (including
Jiff Data Agreements), to retain, produce copies, prepare derivative works,
disclose, combine with other data, and grant third parties rights, as the case
may be, to each of Jiff-Licensed Data as necessary for the operation of the
Jiff Business as presently conducted. Jiff has been and is in compliance with
all Contracts pursuant to which Jiff Processes or has Processed Jiff-Licensed
Data, and the consummation of the Transactions will not conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, or default under, any such Contract.
Schedule 2.10(p)(ix) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter identifies each Contract
governing any Jiff-Licensed Data to which Jiff is a party or is bound by,
except the Contracts substantially on standard terms of use entered into by
users of Jiff Products (copies of which standard terms have been made
available to Castlight).

(x) Jiff is the owner of all right, title and interest in and to each element
of Jiff Data that Jiff purports to own (collectively, "Jiff-Owned Data"). Jiff
has the right to Process all Jiff-Owned Data as necessary for the conduct of
the Jiff Business as currently conducted, without obtaining any permission or
authorization of any Person (other than permissions or authorizations that
Jiff has obtained).

(xi) To the knowledge of Jiff, Jiff does not Process the Personal Data of any
natural Person under the age of 13 in violation of any Applicable Law.

(q) HIPAA Compliance. Without limiting Section 2.10(p), Jiff currently is and
at all times has been in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable, or then applicable, requirements of HIPAA. To the extent required
under HIPAA, Jiff has in effect Jiff Data Agreements that satisfy all of the
requirements of 45 CFR §§ 164.504(e) and 164.314(a), and Jiff is in compliance
with all such agreements in all material respects. Jiff has not received any
written complaint or notice of investigation, including written communications
from the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, from
any Person, entity or governmental authority regarding Jiff's, or any of their
agents', employees' or independent contractors' uses or disclosures of, or
security practices or security incidents regarding, individually identifiable
health-related information, nor any written complaint from any third party,
from any individual regarding the improper disclosure of individually
identifiable health-related health information by Jiff, or any of their
representatives, and Jiff has no knowledge of receiving any of the foregoing
orally. Jiff has undertaken all necessary surveys, audits, inventories,
reviews, analyses and/or assessments (including any necessary risk assessments
and risk analyses) of all areas of their business and operations, in each case
as and to the extent required by HIPAA.

(r) Jiff Websites. To the knowledge of Jiff, no domain names have been
registered by any Person that are similar to any trademarks, service marks,
domain names or business or trading names used, created or owned by Jiff. The contents of any Jiff Website and all
transactions conducted over the Internet comply with Applicable Law.

that, considered individually or considered collectively with any other such
agreements, plans, arrangements or other Contracts, will, or would reasonably
be expected to, as a result of the Transactions (whether alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events), give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that would reasonably be expected to
be non-deductible under Section 162 of the Code (or any corresponding or

2.12 Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters.

(a) Schedule 2.12(a) of the Jiff Disclosure Letter lists, with respect to Jiff
and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a
single employer with Jiff (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (ii) each loan to an employee, (iii) other than
Jiff Option Plan, all stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock
appreciation right, restricted stock unit, supplemental retirement, severance,
sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation,
cafeteria benefit (Section 125 of the Code), dependent care (Section 129 of
the Code), life insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or
arrangements, (iv) all bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, severance,
retirement, deferred compensation or incentive plans (including cash incentive
plans), programs or arrangements, (v) all other fringe or employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements and (vi) all employment, individual
consulting, retention, change of control or executive compensation or
severance agreements, written or otherwise, as to which any unsatisfied
obligations of Jiff remain for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or
former employee, consultant or non-employee director of Jiff (all of the
foregoing described in clauses (i) through (vi), collectively, the "Jiff
Employee Plans"), provided that, solely for purposes of listing in the Jiff
Disclosure Letter, at-will offer letters or consulting agreements which are
terminable for convenience by Jiff without notice or Liability need not be
listed, even if still constituting Jiff Employee Plans.

(b) Jiff has made available to Castlight a true, correct and complete copy of
each of Jiff Employee Plans and related plan documents. Jiff does not sponsor
or maintain any self-funded employee benefit plan, including any plan to which
a stop-loss policy applies. Jiff has, with respect to each Jiff Employee Plan
that is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided to Castlight true,
correct and complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three
plan years. Any Jiff Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable determination,
opinion or advisory letter as to its qualified status under the Code,
including all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986
and subsequent legislation, or has applied (or has time remaining in which to
apply) to the IRS for such a letter prior to the expiration of the requisite
period under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a standardized prototype
plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and
is valid as to the adopting employer. Jiff has made available to Castlight a
true, correct and complete copy of the most recent IRS determination, advisory
or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Jiff Employee Plan, and
nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter that would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified status of any
Jiff Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. Jiff has made
available to Castlight all registration statements and prospectuses prepared
in connection with each Jiff Employee Plan. All individuals who, pursuant to
the terms of any Jiff Employee Plan, are entitled to participate in any Jiff
Employee Plan, are currently participating in such Jiff Employee Plan or have
been offered an opportunity to do so and have declined in writing. (c) None of Jiff Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other
retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA")
or similar state law and Jiff has complied with the requirements of COBRA.
There has been no "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and not exempt under Section 408 of
ERISA and regulatory guidance thereunder) with respect to any Jiff Employee
Plan. Each Jiff Employee Plan has been administered, in material respects, in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code),
Jiff and each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations required to be
performed by it under, is not in default under or in violation of, and has no
knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any of Jiff
Employee Plans. Neither Jiff nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any
Liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I
of ERISA with respect to any Jiff Employee Plans. All contributions required
to be made by Jiff or any ERISA Affiliate to any Jiff Employee Plan have been
made on or before their due dates. In addition, with respect to each Jiff
Employee Plan intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, Jiff and
each of the ERISA Affiliates have at all times made timely deposits of
employee salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as
determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Department of
Labor. No Jiff Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Jiff nor ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each Jiff Employee Plan can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, without Liability to Castlight (other than ordinary and
reasonable administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event).

control over financial reporting prior to the Agreement Date, to Castlight's

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Castlight and Jiff have previously

accordance with its terms. At no time shall any party hereto disclose any non-
public information about a party hereto to any other Person without the prior
written consent of the party hereto about which such non-public information
relates. The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any public disclosures regarding any indemnification dispute
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, a party
hereto shall be permitted to disclose any and all such information to its
financial, Tax and legal advisors (each of whom is subject to a similar
obligation of confidentiality), to any Governmental Entity or administrative
agency to the extent necessary or advisable in compliance with Applicable Law
and the rules of NYSE and Castlight may make such public communications as it
may determine is reasonably appropriate (provided that Castlight will make
good faith efforts to provide Jiff with written notice of any such disclosure
and, if possible, allow Jiff the opportunity to comment on such communication.
The Stockholders' Agent hereby agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent as though the
Stockholders' Agent were a party thereto. With respect to the Stockholders'
Agent, as used in the Confidentiality Agreement, the term "Confidential
Information" shall also include non-public information relating to the Merger
or this Agreement received by the Stockholders' Agent after the Closing or
relating to the period after the Closing.

communications relating to the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions or
use the other party's name or refer to the other party directly or indirectly
in connection with any media interview, advertisement, news release, press
release or professional or trade publication, or in any print media, whether
or not in response to an inquiry, without the prior written approval of the
other party unless required by Applicable Law (in which event a satisfactory
opinion of counsel to that effect shall be first delivered prior to any such
disclosure), except to the extent such disclosures repeat information which
has previously been publicly disclosed and except as reasonably necessary for
Castlight to obtain Castlight Stockholder Approval and Jiff to obtain Jiff
Stockholder Approval and the Requisite Stockholder Approval and the other
consents and approvals of Jiff Stockholders and other third parties
contemplated by this Agreement.

to cooperate with each other party hereto, to take, or cause to be taken, all

practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including the satisfaction
of the respective conditions set forth in Article VII, and including to

Castlight and the Merger Sub nor any of their controlled Affiliates shall
acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing
any equity interest in or assets of, or by any other manner, any business or
any Person that competes with Jiff if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to present a material risk of delaying the Effective Time or making
it materially more difficult to consummate the Merger.

(c) As promptly as practicable after Castlight and Jiff jointly determine that
doing so is required, Castlight and Jiff shall execute and file, or join in
the execution and filing of, any application, notification (including the

any Governmental Entity, or expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under such Antitrust Laws, that may be reasonably required, or
that Castlight may reasonably request to be made, in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Castlight and Jiff
shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, and to
cooperate with each other to obtain promptly, all such authorizations,
approvals, consents, expirations and terminations, and Castlight and Jiff
shall each pay an equal share of any filing fees associated therewith.

more of the foregoing, an "Antitrust Restraint").

(e) Each of Castlight and Jiff shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication between such party and any Governmental Entity regarding any of
the Transactions. Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, Castlight shall have the right (i) to direct all matters with any

advance, and direct the revision of, any filing, application, notification or
other document to be submitted by Jiff to any Governmental Entity under any
Antitrust Law; provided that, to the extent practicable, Castlight shall
consult with Jiff and consider in good faith the views of Jiff with respect to
the information related to Jiff that appears in any such filing, application,
notification or other document. If Castlight or any Affiliate of Castlight
receives any formal or informal request for supplemental information or

written consent of Castlight, (A) permit any of Jiff's Representatives to participate in any meeting with any

grants Castlight the opportunity to attend and lead the discussions at such
meeting or (B) proffer, make proposals, negotiate, execute, carry out or

Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) none of the parties shall (and each of the

the Code.

(b) Each of Castlight, the Stockholders' Agent, Jiff Securityholders and Jiff
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any of the
others, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Legal Proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
request therefor) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant

convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Castlight, Jiff, the Stockholders' Agent and Jiff
Securityholders agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to Jiff relating to any Taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective
Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Tax Authority.

(c) Jiff shall cause each Jiff Securityholder to further agree, upon request,
to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the Transactions).

Returns of Jiff any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are filed after the Closing

material Tax Returns at least 20 days prior to their filing, shall permit the
Stockholders' Agent to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to
filing and shall consider in good faith and incorporate all reasonable
comments made by the Stockholders' Agent in writing.

6.14 280G Stockholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable, Jiff shall
submit to Jiff Stockholders for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Castlight), by such number of holders of Jiff Stockholders as is required
by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or
benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G Payments")
(which determination shall be made by Jiff and shall be subject to review and
approval by Castlight, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), such that such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Closing, Jiff shall
provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Castlight that (i) a vote of the
holders of Jiff Capital Stock was solicited in conformance with Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite
stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits
that were subject to the stockholder vote (the "280G Stockholder Approval") or
(ii) that the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence,
that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent
they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to
the Parachute Payment Waivers that were executed by the affected individuals
prior to the solicitation of the vote of the holders of Jiff Capital Stock
pursuant to this Section 6.14.

6.15 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) Prior to or as of the Closing, Jiff will cause coverage to be extended
under the directors' and officers' insurance policy maintained by Jiff as of
the Agreement Date with respect to any actions or omissions by any current or
former officers or directors of Jiff (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") occurring
prior to the Closing, by obtaining a related "tail" policy that has an
effective term of six years from the Closing Date, with coverage in amount and
scope at least as favorable as Jiff's existing coverage. The cost of such tail
policy will be treated as a Transaction Expense of Jiff at 150% of the actual
cost thereof (such that 75% of the actual cost thereof will be deducted in the
Stock Consideration calculation). Castlight will not, or will cause the
Surviving Entity to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any
respect during such term.

(b) In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
Castlight and the Surviving Entity agree to indemnify and hold harmless,
reimburse, exculpate from liability, and advance expenses to all DandO
Indemnified Parties to the same extent and on the same terms as such persons
are entitled to indemnification, reimbursement, exculpation or expense
advancement by Jiff as of the Agreement Date, whether pursuant to applicable
documents, individual indemnification agreements, by Applicable Law or
otherwise, for acts or omissions or matters that occurred or arose at or prior
to the Effective Time (regardless of whether any proceeding relating to any
DandO Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification, exculpation, or expense
advancement with respect to any such matters, acts, or omissions is commenced
before or after the Closing); provided that such obligation of Castlight and
the Surviving Entity with respect to any such indemnification, holding
harmless, reimbursement, exculpation or advancement of expenses that are
pursuant to an agreement between a DandO Indemnified Party and Jiff shall only
be to the extent that such agreement is set forth on Schedule 6.15(b) of the
Jiff Disclosure Letter; provided, further, that no DandO Indemnified Party may
seek indemnification, to be held harmless, reimbursement, exculpation or
advancement of expenses from Castlight or the Surviving Entity for amounts
that such DandO Indemnified Party owes or may owe to Castlight or the Surviving
Entity in such DandO Indemnified Party's capacity as a Converting Holder under the provisions set forth in Article IX. Any claims for indemnification made
under this Section 6.15 on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time shall survive until the final resolution thereof.

(c) The Surviving Entity shall, and Castlight shall cause the Surviving Entity
or its successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs,
personal representatives, successors or assigns) in any legal action brought
by such person that is successful to enforce the obligations of Castlight, the
Surviving Entity or its successors under this Section 6.15. The obligations of
Castlight, the Surviving Entity and its successors under this Section 6.15
shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns) without the prior written consent of
such DandO Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal representatives,
successors or assigns, as applicable).

6.16 Director and Officer Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Castlight
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of
Castlight Class B Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect
to Castlight Class B Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each
individual who will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Castlight to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

6.17 NYSE Listing. Castlight shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock being issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing in the NYSE at or prior to the Effective Time.

6.18 Certain Officer and Directors of the Combined Company. Castlight shall
take all action necessary to cause two representatives from the Jiff Board to
be mutually agreed by Jiff and Castlight to be appointed to the Castlight
Board effective upon the Closing.

6.19 Intellectual Property. Jiff will investigate the items identified as
"HUnknown License" or "HLicense Not Found" in the document loaded at 3.3.7
with file name "Open Source (Black Duck).pdf" and prepare a remediation plan
with respect to such items that is reasonably acceptable to Castlight and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such plan prior to the Closing.

applicable to any such breach that by its nature cannot be cured), (ii) there
shall have been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Jiff which shall not

party hereto from Liability in connection with any intentional
misrepresentation made by, or a willful breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation of, such party herein.

ARTICLE IX 
ESCROW FUND AND INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Escrow Fund.

(a) At the Effective Time, Castlight shall withhold the Escrow Amount from the
Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) (the aggregate amount
shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock so held by Castlight from time to
time, together with any non-taxable stock dividends declared and paid in
respect of such shares, the "Escrow Fund") and deposit the Escrow Fund with
U.S. Bank National Association, as the "Escrow Agent." The Escrow Fund shall
be governed by the provisions set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit L. The Escrow Fund and the
Set-Off Right shall constitute partial security for the benefit of Castlight
(on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) with respect to any
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Converting Holders under this Article IX. Subject to Section 9.4, the Escrow
Agent shall hold the Escrow Fund until 11:59 p.m. local time on the date (the
"Escrow Release Date") that is 12 months after the Effective Time. Except to
the extent there is a cancellation of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock
held in the Escrow Fund in connection with Indemnifiable Damages in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock
held in the Escrow Fund, including shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Annex A hereto which are deposited into the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 9.4, shall be treated by Castlight as issued and
outstanding stock of Castlight, the Jiff Stockholders shall be shown as the
registered owners of such shares on the certificate(s) evidencing such shares
(if such shares are certificated) and the Jiff Stockholders shall be entitled
to exercise voting rights and to receive dividends with respect to such shares
(other than stock dividends, which shall be withheld by Castlight and included
as part of the Escrow Fund). The Converting Holders shall not receive interest
or other earnings on the shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock (other than
as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) in the Escrow Fund.
Neither the Escrow Fund (including any portion thereof) nor any beneficial
interest therein may be pledged, subjected to any Encumbrance, sold, assigned
or transferred by any Converting Holder or be taken or reached by any legal or
equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other Liability of any
Converting Holder, in each case prior to the distribution of the Escrow Fund
to any Converting Holder in accordance with Section 9.1(b), except that each
Converting Holder shall be entitled to assign such Converting Holder's rights
to such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund by will, by the
laws of intestacy or by other operation of law.

(b) Within five Business Days following the Escrow Release Date, Castlight (or
its agent) will distribute to each Converting Holder such Converting Holder's
Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund less that portion of the Escrow Fund that is
determined, in the reasonable judgment of Castlight, to be necessary to
satisfy all unsatisfied or disputed claims for indemnification specified in
any Claim Certificate delivered to the Stockholders' Agent on or prior to the
Escrow Release Date in accordance with this Article IX, which portion shall
remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims for Indemnifiable Damages have
been resolved or satisfied. 9.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, from and after
the Closing, each Converting Holder shall severally (and not jointly), based
on such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share, indemnify and hold harmless
Castlight, Merger Sub and Jiff and their respective officers, directors,
agents and employees and each Person, if any, who controls or may control
Castlight within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an "Indemnified
Person") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, fees,
Taxes, interest, costs and expenses, including reasonable costs of
investigation, enforcement and defense and reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, experts and other professionals, directly or indirectly, whether or
not due to a Third-Party Claim (collectively, "Indemnifiable Damages"),
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with:

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Jiff herein or in
Jiff Disclosure Letter (including any exhibit to or schedule of the Jiff
Disclosure Letter) to be true and correct (A) as of the Agreement Date (except
in the case of representations and warranties that by their terms speak only
as of a specified date or dates, which representations and warranties shall be
true and correct as of such date or dates), or (B) as of the Closing Date as
though such representation or warranty were made as of the Closing Date
(except in the case of representations and warranties that by their terms
speak only as of a specific date or dates, which representations and
warranties shall be true and correct as of such date or dates);

(ii) any failure of any certification, representation or warranty made by Jiff
in any certificate (other than the Spreadsheet and Jiff Closing Financial
Certificate) delivered to Castlight pursuant to Section 1.2(b) or Section 7.3
of this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date such certificate is
delivered to Castlight;

(iii) any breach of, or default in connection with, any of the covenants,
agreements or obligations made by Jiff herein or in any other agreements
contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the Merger which were to be
performed prior to the Closing;

(iv) any inaccuracies in the Spreadsheet or Jiff Closing Financial
Certificate;

(v) any issuances made with respect to Dissenting Shares, and any interest,
costs, expenses and fees incurred by any Indemnified Person in connection with
the exercise of any appraisal rights or dissenters' rights, to the extent that
such amounts, in the aggregate, exceed the value of the consideration that
otherwise would have been issuable (based on the Castlight Stock Price)
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares;

(vi) any claims by any then-current holder of any Equity Interests of Jiff
(including any predecessors), arising out of, resulting from or in connection
with (I) the allocation of the Merger Consideration or any portion thereof
that differs from that specified on the Spreadsheet, or (II) for breach of
fiduciary duty by the directors and officers of Jiff in connection with this
Agreement and/or the Transactions;

(vii) any matter set forth in Schedule 9.2(a)(vii) of the Jiff Disclosure
Letter or that is or would be an exception to the representations and
warranties made in the first two sentences of Section 2.6 (Litigation) as of
the Agreement Date or the Closing; (viii) any Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent not reflected as an accrual in the
Pre-Signing Jiff Balance Sheet, as adjusted for Taxes arising in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice through the Closing Date; and

(ix) any intentional fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct by or on behalf of Jiff in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(b) Materiality standards and qualifications by reference to the defined term
"Material Adverse Effect" in any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation shall only be taken into account in determining whether an
inaccuracy in such representation or warranty, or a breach of such covenant,
agreement or obligation, exists, and shall not be taken into account in
determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such
inaccuracy or breach.

9.3 Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Other Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnified
Person may make a claim against the Escrow Fund or exercise the Set-Off Right
in respect of any claim for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) or (ii) of
Section 9.2(a) (other than claims arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with (i) intentional fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct by or on behalf of Jiff in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions or (ii) any failure of any of the Special Representations
to be true and correct as aforesaid) unless and until a Claim Certificate
(together with any other delivered Claim Certificates) describing
Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $650,000 (the
"Basket") has been delivered, in which case the Indemnified Person may make
claims for indemnification, compensation and reimbursement and may receive
shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock from the Escrow Fund or exercise the
Set-Off Right for all Indemnifiable Damages (including the amount of the
Basket). The Basket shall not apply to any Special Claims.

(b) If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Fund and the Set-
Off Right shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for the indemnity
obligations of each Converting Holder under this Agreement for Indemnifiable
Damages (and not specific performance or other equitable remedies) arising out
of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) and
(ii) of Section 9.2(a), except (A) in the case of intentional fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of Jiff or
such Converting Holder and (B) any failure of any of the representations and
warranties made by (I) Jiff in Section 2.1(a) (Organization, Standing, Power
and Subsidiaries), Section 2.2 (Capital Structure), Section 2.3(a)and
(b)(ii)(A) (Authority; Non-contravention), Section 2.11 (Taxes) or Section
2.17 (Transaction Fees) or (II) Jiff in any certificate delivered to Castlight
pursuant to this Agreement that are within the scope of those covered by the
Sections listed in the foregoing clause (ii)(A) (collectively, the "Special
Representations") to be true and correct as aforesaid.

(c) In the case of any claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the failure of any of the Special
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or the matters listed in
clauses (iii) through (ix) of Section 9.2(a) (collectively, "Special Claims"),
after Indemnified Persons have exhausted or made claims upon a number of
shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund (after taking
into account all other claims for indemnification, compensation and
reimbursement from the Escrow Fund made by Indemnified Persons) and fully
exercised Set-Off Rights, or following the Escrow Release Date, each
Converting Holder shall have several (and not joint) liability, based on such
Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages
resulting therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the total Liability of a Converting Holder under this Article IX shall be limited to the economic value (on a
Castlight Stock Price basis) of the aggregate number of shares of Castlight
Class B Common Stock issuable to such Converting Holder pursuant to Section
1.3(a) (inclusive of the Escrow Amount and value of Set-Off Rights) (the
"Upper Cap"); provided that any limitation of Liability in this Section 9.3(c)
shall not apply in the case of intentional fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of such Converting
Holder or of which such Converting Holder had actual knowledge.

(d) Following the Closing, this Article IX shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy for recovery of monetary Indemnifiable Damages by the
Indemnified Persons for all indemnifiable matters or other breaches under this
Agreement (which means, for example, that the survival periods and liability
limits set forth in this Article IX shall control notwithstanding any
statutory or common law provisions or principles to the contrary), (ii) all
applicable statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to
claims for Indemnifiable Damages shall be shortened to the applicable claims
periods and survival periods set forth herein and (iii) the Indemnified
Persons irrevocably waive any and all rights they may have to make claims for
monetary damages against any Converting Holder under statutory and common law
as a result of any Indemnifiable Damages and any and all other monetary
damages incurred by the Indemnified Persons with respect to this Agreement
whether or not in excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered
pursuant to this Article IX.

(e) Claims for Indemnifiable Damages that have been resolved in favor of
Indemnified Persons shall be recovered, first, from the Escrow Fund, or
through the exercise of the Set-Off Right and only after each of the Escrow
Fund and Set-Off Right have been exhausted, then directly from the Converting
Holders. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
(but subject to the last sentence of Section 9.3(c)), the amounts that an
Indemnified Person recovers from the Escrow Fund or through the exercise of
the Set-Off Right pursuant to Special Claims shall not reduce the amount that
an Indemnified Person may recover with respect to claims that are not Special
Claims. By way of illustration and not limitation, assuming there are no other
claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, in the event that
Indemnifiable Damages resulting from a Special Claim are first satisfied from
the Escrow Fund and through the exercise of the Set-Off Right and such
recovery fully depletes the Escrow Fund and Set-Off Right, the maximum amount
recoverable by an Indemnified Person pursuant to a subsequent claim that is
not a Special Claim shall continue to be the full dollar value of the Escrow
Fund and the Set-Off Right (based on the Castlight Stock Price) irrespective
of the fact that the Escrow Fund and Set-Off Right was used to satisfy such
Special Claim, such that the amount recoverable for such two claims would be
the same regardless of the chronological order in which they were made.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) no
Converting Holder shall have any right of indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement, contribution or right of advancement from Castlight, the
Surviving Entity or any other Indemnified Person (based upon such Converting
Holder's position as an officer, director, employee or agent of Jiff or
otherwise) with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages claimed by any
Indemnified Person or any right of subrogation against Jiff or the Surviving
Entity with respect to any indemnification, compensation or reimbursement of
an Indemnified Person by reason of any of the matters set forth in Section
9.2(a), (ii) the rights and remedies of the Indemnified Persons after the
Effective Time shall not be limited by (x) any investigation by or on behalf
of, or disclosure to (other than in Jiff Disclosure Letter with respect to
clauses (i), (ii) and (x) of Section 9.2(a), subject to any limitations
expressly set forth therein), any Indemnified Person at or prior to the
Effective Time regarding any failure, breach or other event or circumstance or
(y) any waiver of any condition to the Closing related thereto, (iii) if an
Indemnified Person's claim under this Article IX may be properly characterized
in multiple ways in accordance with this Article IX such that such claim may
or may not be subject to different limitations depending on such
characterization, then such Indemnified Person shall have the right to
characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery and time to assert such claim
permitted in accordance with this Article IX and (iv) no Converting Holder
shall be liable for the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
and/or agreement of another Converting Holder or any intentional fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of any
Person other than Jiff or such Converting Holder; provided that nothing herein
shall limit the Liability of a Converting Holder for any intentional fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of such
Converting Holder.

(g) All Indemnifiable Damages shall be calculated net of the amount of any
actual recoveries actually received by an Indemnified Person prior to the
Escrow Release Date under any existing insurance policies and contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions (in each case, calculated net of
any actual collection costs and reserves, expenses, deductibles or premium
adjustments or retrospectively rated premiums (as determined in good faith by
an Indemnified Person) incurred or paid to procure such recoveries) in respect
of any Indemnifiable Damages suffered, paid, sustained or incurred by any
Indemnified Person; provided that no Indemnified Person shall have any
obligation to seek to obtain or continue to pursue any such recoveries. If an
Indemnified Person receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies
issued by insurance companies or third-party indemnification or contribution
payments subsequent to its receipt of an indemnification payment by the
Converting Holders, then such Indemnified Person will, without duplication,
promptly reimburse the Converting Holders for any payment made by such
Converting Holders, up to the amount received by the Indemnified Person.

(h) Any claim for Indemnifiable Damages will be calculated without regard to
any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental or consequential damages unless
(i) any such punitive, exemplary, special, incidental or consequential damages
are actually awarded to a third party by a Governmental Entity or (ii) any
such special or consequential damages are otherwise reasonably foreseeable
under an objective standard.

(i) Any claim for indemnification under Article IX, and any offer to
compromise or settle such claim, must be made on a pro rata basis to all
Converting Holders (based on their respective Pro Rata Shares).

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Jiff is not making
and shall not be construed to have made, and the Converting Holders shall not
have any liability or indemnification obligation with respect to, any
representation or warranty as to the amount or availability of any net
operating losses, Tax credits, or other Tax attribute. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Converting Holders shall not have any
liability or indemnification obligation for any Taxes of Jiff resulting from
any action outside of the ordinary course of business taken by Jiff on the
Closing Date but after the Closing.

(k) Any liability for indemnification under this Article IX shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach or other violation of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, certificate or
certification.

(l) Castlight acknowledges that there are assumptions inherent in making any
projections or estimates, Castlight is familiar with such uncertainties and
that Castlight is responsible for making its own evaluation of Jiff and is not
relying on, and shall have no claim against Jiff or its equity holders with
respect to, such projections or estimates.

9.4 Period for Claims. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.4, the
period (the "Castlight Claims Period") during which Indemnified Persons shall
have the right to bring claims for Indemnifiable Damages (i) arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) and
(ii) of Section 9.2(a) (other than with respect to any of the Special Representations)
shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. local time on the
date that is 12 months after the Effective Time and (ii) arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the Special Claims, shall commence at the
Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. local time on the date that is the
expiration date of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
underlying subject matter of such Special Claims or three months thereafter in
the case of Section 2.11 (Taxes) only (which for clarity is not the maximum
claim period permitted under Section 8106 of the DGCL). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, such portion of the Escrow Fund or
the Earnout at the Escrow Release Date or the payment date for the Earnout, as
applicable, as in the reasonable judgment of Castlight may be necessary to
satisfy any specific unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable
Damages specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the Stockholders'
Agent on or prior to the Escrow Release Date shall remain in the Escrow Fund
or, in the case of shares issuable pursuant to the Earnout, deposited with the
Escrow Agent, until such claims for Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved
or satisfied.

9.5 Claims.

(a) From time to time during the applicable Claims Period, Castlight may
deliver to the Stockholders' Agent and the Escrow Agent one or more
certificates signed by any officer of Castlight (each, a "Claim Certificate"):

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or
accrued, or reasonably believes that it will incur, pay, reserve or accrue,
Indemnifiable Damages (or that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax
Authority may reasonably raise such matter in an audit of Castlight or its
subsidiaries, that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Indemnifiable
Damages);

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the
maximum amount reasonably believed by Castlight to be incurred, paid,
reserved, accrued or demanded by a third party); and

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Castlight) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of Castlight as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not
limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time by
Castlight by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long as
the delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made within the applicable
Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts and
circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claims Certificate;
provided that all claims for Indemnifiable Damages properly set forth in a
Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding
until such claims have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the
expiration of such Claims Period. No delay in providing such Claim Certificate
within the applicable Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Person's
rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Stockholders'
Agent or the Converting Holders are materially prejudiced thereby.

(c) For clarity, while Castlight may deliver a Claim Certificate with respect
to a Third-Party Claim at any time within the Castlight Claims Period in order
to preserve its rights and remedies hereunder, the Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to seek actual
recovery from the Escrow Fund or directly from the Converting Holders with
respect to such Third-Party Claim unless (i) the dispute between Castlight and
the applicable third party has been resolved by either a binding settlement
agreement or a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction
or (ii) Castlight and the Stockholder's Agent agree in writing to such
recovery.

(d) In the event Castlight delivers a Claim Certificate pursuant to this
Section 9.5, Castlight shall provide the Stockholders' Agent with reasonable
supporting documentation and information related to such Claim Certificate,
including, reasonable access by the Stockholders' Agent to information about
Castlight, Jiff or the Surviving Entity to the extent reasonably necessary to
evaluate the claims set forth in such Claim Certificate.



9.6 Resolution of Objections to Claims.

(a) If the Stockholders' Agent does not contest, by written notice to
Castlight and the Escrow Agent, any claim or claims by Castlight made in any
Claim Certificate within the 30-day period following receipt of the Claim
Certificate, then Castlight may cancel a number of shares of Castlight Class B
Common Stock from the Escrow Fund or the Earnout having a total value equal to
the amount of the Indemnifiable Damages corresponding to such claim or claims
as set forth in such Claim Certificate; provided that the per share value of
any shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock cancelled to satisfy any claims
in a Claim Certificate under this Article IX shall be the Castlight Stock
Price.

(b) If the Stockholders' Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by
Castlight made in any Claim Certificate within the 30-day period set forth in
Section 9.6(a), Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent shall attempt in good
faith for 60 days after Castlight's receipt of such written objection to
resolve such objection. If Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent shall so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent and, to the extent such
memorandum is executed prior to the Escrow Release Date, delivered to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent and Castlight, as applicable, shall be entitled
to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and Castlight may cancel a number
of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock from the Escrow Fund or Earnout in
accordance with the terms of such memorandum; provided that the per share
value of any shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock cancelled to satisfy any
claims pursuant to this Section 9.6(b) shall be the Castlight Stock Price.

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the 60-day period for good
faith negotiation set forth in Section 9.6(b), but in any event upon the
expiration of such 60-day period, either Castlight or the Stockholders' Agent
may bring an action in accordance with the terms of Section 10.11 to resolve
the matter. The decision of an applicable court as to the validity and amount
of any claim in such Claim Certificate and the amount, if determined, that
constitutes Indemnifiable Damages under this Article IX for which recovery may
be made shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties
hereto and the Converting Holders, the Escrow Agent and Castlight, as
applicable, shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and (i)
if the Converting Holders are the indemnifying parties, Castlight may cancel a
number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock in, the Escrow Fund or
Earnout in accordance therewith; provided that the per share value of any
shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock cancelled to satisfy any claims
pursuant to this Section 9.6(c) shall be the Castlight Stock Price or (ii) if
Castlight is the indemnifying party, Castlight shall issue, or cause to be
issued, to the Converting Holders and holders of Jiff Options (based on their
Pro Rata Share), reasonably promptly following such decision, a number of
shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock in accordance therewith; provided
that the per share value of any shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock issued to satisfy any claims
pursuant to this Section 9.6(c) shall be the Castlight Stock Price.

(d) For purposes of this Section 9.6(d), in any suit hereunder in which any
claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim Certificate is at issue,
Castlight shall be deemed to be the prevailing party unless the applicable
court determines in favor of the Stockholders' Agent (on behalf of the
Converting Holders) with respect to more than one-half of the amount in
dispute, in which case the Converting Holders shall be deemed to be the
prevailing party. The non-prevailing party shall pay its own fees and expenses
and the fees and expenses of the prevailing party, including attorneys' fees
and costs, reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

(e) Any portion of the Escrow Fund and/or Earnout held following the Escrow
Release Date or the payment date of the Earnout, as applicable, with respect
to pending but unresolved claims for indemnification that is not awarded to
Castlight upon the resolution of such claims shall be distributed by the
Escrow Agent to the Converting Holders within five Business Days following
resolution of such claims and in accordance with each such Converting Holder's
Pro Rata Share of such portion of the Escrow Fund or Earnout Pro Rata Share of
the Earnout.

9.7 Stockholders' Agent.

(a) At the Closing, Fortis Advisors LLC shall be constituted and appointed as
the Stockholders' Agent. The Stockholders' Agent shall be the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Converting Holders to: (i)
execute, as the Stockholders' Agent, this Agreement and any agreement or
instrument entered into or delivered in connection with the Transactions, (ii)
give and receive notices, instructions and communications permitted or
required under this Agreement, or any other agreement, document or instrument
entered into or executed in connection herewith, for and on behalf of any
Converting Holder, to or from Castlight (on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement, the Earnout or any of the
Transactions and any other matters contemplated by this Agreement or by such
other agreement, document or instrument (except to the extent that this
Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall
be given or received by each Converting Holder individually), (iii) review,
negotiate and agree to and authorize Castlight to cancel a number of shares of
Castlight Class B Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund or subject to the Set-
Off Right in satisfaction of claims asserted by Castlight (on behalf of itself
or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such claims)
pursuant to this Article IX, (iv) make and object to claims pursuant to
Section 9.6 and Section 9.10, (v) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into,
or, if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend, settlements and compromises
of, and comply with Orders of courts with respect to, such claims, resolve any
such claims, take any actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute
relating hereto or to the Transactions by arbitration, settlement or
otherwise, and take or forego any or all actions permitted or required of any
Converting Holder or necessary in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for
the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement, (vi) consult with legal counsel, independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and
expense of the Converting Holders, (vii) consent or agree to any amendment to
this Agreement, including Annex A, or to waive any terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including Annex A, providing rights or benefits to the
Converting Holders in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein and (viii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing,
in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under
any circumstance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders' Agent shall
have no obligation to act on behalf of the Converting Holders, except as
expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Stockholders'
Agent Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Stockholders' Agent in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Jiff Disclosure
Letter. Castlight, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (including after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity) shall be entitled to rely on the
appointment of Fortis Advisors LLC as the Stockholders' Agent and treat such
Stockholders' Agent as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Converting
Holder and has having the duties, power and authority provided for in this
Section 9.7. The Converting Holders and their successors shall be bound by all
actions taken and documents executed by the Stockholders' Agent in connection
with this Article IX, and all defenses which may be available to any
Converting Holder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Stockholders' Agent taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement are waived.
Castlight and other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely exclusively
on any action or decision of the Stockholders' Agent. The Person serving as
the Stockholders' Agent may be removed or replaced from time to time, or if
such Person resigns from its position as the Stockholders' Agent, then a
successor may be appointed, by the holders of a majority in interest of the
aggregate number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock then held in the
Escrow Fund upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice to Castlight. No
bond shall be required of the Stockholders' Agent. The powers, immunities and
rights to indemnification granted to the Stockholders' Agent Group hereunder:
(i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Converting Holder and
shall be binding on any successor thereto and (ii) shall survive the delivery
of an assignment by any Converting Holder of the whole or any fraction of his,
her or its interest in the Escrow Fund or the Earnout Payments.

(b) Certain Converting Holders have entered into an engagement agreement (the
"Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement") with the Stockholders' Agent to
provide direction to the Stockholders' Agent in connection with its services
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Stockholders' Agent
Engagement Agreement (such Converting Holders, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory
Group"). Neither the Stockholders' Agent nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the "Stockholders' Agent Group") shall be liable to any
Converting Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholders'
Agent while acting in good faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Converting Holders shall severally
but not jointly indemnify the Stockholders' Agent Group and defend and hold it
harmless against any loss, Liability, claim, damage, fee, fine, judgment,
amount paid in settlement or expense incurred without gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders' Agent and
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder, including all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal and skilled professionals'
costs reasonably incurred by the Stockholders' Agent and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers (collectively, the "Stockholders' Agent
Expenses"). The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholders' Agent or any member of the
Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. If not paid directly to the Stockholders' Agent by the
Converting Holders, such Stockholders' Agent Expenses may be recovered by the
Stockholders' Agent first, from the Expense Fund and second, from the portion
of the Escrow Fund and/or Earnout shares otherwise distributable to the
Converting Holders (and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified
Person or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person)
on or after the Escrow Release Date or Earnout distribution date, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms hereof, at the time of distribution, and
such recovery will be made from the Converting Holders according to their
respective Pro Rata Shares of such Stockholders' Agent Expenses. The
Converting Holders acknowledge that the Stockholders' Agent shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Stockholders'
Agent shall not be required to take any action unless the Stockholders' Agent has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are
sufficient to protect the Stockholders' Agent against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholders' Agent in performing
such actions.

(c) The Stockholders' Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine and
(iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on
behalf of the applicable Converting Holder or other party. After the Closing,
any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholders' Agent that is
within the scope of the Stockholders' Agent's authority under Section 9.7(a)
shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Converting Holders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Converting Holder; and each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a
notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Converting Holder. Castlight, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Entity and the Indemnified Persons are hereby relieved from any
Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of
the Stockholders' Agent.

(d) The Stockholders' Agent may retain a DVD copy of the data room contents
and refer to such DVD in the course of performing its duties hereunder,
subject to execution by the Stockholders' Agent of Castlight's standard non-
disclosure agreement (or prior execution by the Stockholders' Agent of a
reasonably equivalent non-disclosure agreement in favor of Jiff that will be
enforceable by the Surviving Entity).

(e) Upon the Closing, Castlight shall deliver to the Stockholders' Agent a
certificate or book-entry entitlement representing 50,000 shares of Castlight
Class B Common Stock (the "Expense Fund Amount"). The Expense Fund Amount
shall be held by the Stockholders' Agent in a segregated client account and
shall be used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the
Stockholders' Agent for any Stockholders' Agent Expenses incurred pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Stockholders' Agent Engagement
Agreement or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group (the "Expense
Fund"). The Stockholders' Agent is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders' Agent is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Converting Holders will not receive any interest on the Expense Fund and
assign to the Stockholders' Agent any such interest. Subject to Advisory Group
approval, the Stockholders' Agent may contribute funds to the Expense Fund
from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Converting Holders. As
soon as reasonably determined by the Stockholders' Agent that the Expense Fund
is no longer required to be withheld, the Stockholders' Agent shall distribute
the remaining Expense Fund (if any) to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Converting Holders.

9.8 Third-Party Claims. In the event that Castlight becomes aware of a claim
by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim") that Castlight in good faith believes
may result in a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Person, Castlight shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve such Third-Party Claim (and
the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Castlight in connection with
defense, enforcement, settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys' fees (other than those of in-house legal counsel), other
professionals' and experts' fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be
included in the Indemnifiable Damages for which Castlight shall be entitled to
receive indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder, and such costs and
expenses shall constitute Indemnifiable Damages subject to indemnification
under Section 9.2; provided that either it is determined according to the
procedures in this Article IX that the Third-Party Claim (or the matters
underlying the Third-Party Claim) constitutes an indemnifiable matter under
Section 9.2(a) or Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent otherwise agree in
writing that such costs and expenses shall constitute Indemnifiable Damages.
The Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim
to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege
relating to any Indemnified Person (and subject to execution by the
Stockholders' Agent of Castlight's (and, if required, such third party's)
standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials contain
confidential or propriety information). However, Castlight shall have the
right in its sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of any
Third-Party Claim and the settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third-
Party Claim. Unless otherwise consented to in writing in advance by Castlight
in its sole discretion, the Stockholders' Agent and its Affiliates may not
participate in any Third-Party Claim or any action related to such Third-Party
Claim (including any discussions or negotiations in connection with the
settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof). In the event that the
Stockholders' Agent has consented to the amount of any settlement or
resolution by Castlight of any such claim (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood and agreed
that it shall be reasonable for the Stockholders' Agent to withhold such
consent if the Stockholders' Agent believes in good faith that there is not
any underlying basis for indemnification with respect to such settlement or
resolution) and which consent shall be deemed to have been given unless the
Stockholders' Agent shall have objected within 30 days after a written request
therefor by Castlight), or if the Stockholders' Agent shall have been
determined to have unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent
to any such settlement or resolution, neither the Stockholders' Agent nor any
Converting Holder shall have any power or authority to object under this
Article IX to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person against the Escrow Fund or Earnout for indemnity with respect to such
settlement or resolution. Otherwise no settlement or resolution by Castlight
of any such claim for indemnification by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person
shall be determinative of the existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages
related to such matter.

9.9 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Castlight, the Stockholders' Agent
and the Converting Holders agree to treat (and cause their respective
Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article IX as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

9.10 Indemnification by Castlight.

(a) From and after the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations (the "Jiff Claims Period" and, together with the Castlight
Claims Period, the "Claims Period"), Castlight shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Converting Holders and the holders of any Jiff Options as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Jiff Indemnified Persons") from
and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each Jiff Indemnified Person
for, any and all Indemnifiable Damages, arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with:

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Castlight in Section
3.1 (Organization and Standing), Section 3.2(a) and (b)(i) (Authority),
Section 3.3 (Issuance of Shares), Section 3.6(a) and Section 3.6(b)
(Capitalization) (collectively, the "Castlight Special Representations") to be
true and correct as of the Agreement Date (except in the case of
representations and warranties that by their terms speak only as of a specific
date or dates, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date or
dates) or as of the Closing Date as though such representation or warranty
were made as of the Closing Date (except in the case of representations and
warranties that by their terms speak only as of a specific date or dates,
which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date
or dates); and

(ii) any failure of any certification, representation or warranty that are
within the scope of the Castlight Special Representations made by Castlight in
any certificate delivered to Jiff pursuant to this Agreement to be true and
correct as of the date such certificate is delivered to Jiff.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the total
Liability of Castlight under this Section 9.10 shall be limited to the dollar
value of the aggregate number of shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock or
securities convertible into shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock issuable
to all Converting Holders and holders of Jiff Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.3(a); provided that any limitation of
Liability in this Section 9.10(b) shall not apply in the case of intentional
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of
Castlight. Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent will cooperate in good faith
to determine whether any Indemnifiable Damages for which Castlight is liable
should more appropriately be paid in cash, shares of Castlight Class B Common
Stock or a combination of the two.

ARTICLE X

GENERAL PROVISIONS

10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. If the Merger is

10.4 Amendment. Subject to Applicable Law, the parties hereto may amend this
Agreement by authorized action at any time pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided that after
Jiff Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement that by Applicable Law requires further approval by Jiff
Stockholders without such further approval. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent may cause this Agreement
to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent.

10.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto owed to such party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive any breaches of any of the covenants, agreements, obligations or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. At any time after the Closing, Castlight and the
Stockholders' Agent may, to the extent legally allowed, (A) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations of the other owed to such party,
(B) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such

signed by Jiff, (II) after the Closing with respect to the Converting Holders
and/or the Stockholders' Agent, signed by the Stockholders' Agent and (III)
with respect to Castlight and/or Merger Sub, signed by Castlight. Without
limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no failure to
exercise or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach or default
shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same or any
other provision herein.

10.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood
and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. The
delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF format of this
Agreement with all executed signature pages (in counterparts or otherwise)
shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and conditions set
forth herein. All of the counterparts will together constitute one and the
same instrument and each counterpart will constitute an original of this
Agreement.

10.7 Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including Jiff Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect,
and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its
terms and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder (except that Section 6.15 is intended to benefit the DandO
Indemnified Parties and Article IX is intended to benefit the Indemnified
Persons and Jiff Indemnified Persons). For clarity, nothing herein or in the
Stockholder Agreement or Joinder Agreement will be deemed to limit the rights
of Jiff Stockholders as the recipients of Castlight Class B Common Stock under
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

10.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and obligations
under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Castlight
and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under
this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Castlight
without the prior consent of any other party hereto; provided that
notwithstanding any such assignment, Castlight and/or Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

10.9 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

10.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to Section 9.3(b), the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties
hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection
with the remedies described herein. For clarity, following the Closing,
Section 9.3(d) will control exclusively regarding remedies for monetary
damages suffered by the Indemnified Persons against the Converting Holders.

10.11 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of California and the Federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of California, the place where this
Agreement was entered and is to be performed, in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents
referred to herein, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a
California State or Federal court. The parties hereto hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law,
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect to any particular
action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the County of Santa
Clara, California. A party hereto may apply either to a court of competent
jurisdiction or to an arbitrator, if one has been appointed, for prejudgment
remedies and emergency relief pending final determination of a claim pursuant
to this Section 10.11. The appointment of an arbitrator does not preclude a
party hereto from seeking prejudgment remedies and emergency relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction.

10.12 Governing Law. This Agreement, all acts and transactions pursuant hereto
and all obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such
state's principles of conflicts of law that would refer a matter to a
different jurisdiction; provided that any matters related to the effectiveness
of the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to such state's principles of conflicts of law that would refer a
matter to a different jurisdiction.

10.13 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

10.14 Additional Agreement. If the Stockholders' Agent so desires, acting on
behalf of the Converting Holders and without the need for any consent or
waiver by Company, Parent, or Sub, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian LLP ("Gunderson") shall be
permitted to represent the Converting Holders after the Closing in connection
with any matter related to the Transactions or any other agreements referenced
herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Gunderson shall be permitted
to represent the Converting Holders, any of their agents and Affiliates, or
any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction, or
dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding)
with Castlight, Jiff or any of their agents or Affiliates under or relating to
this Agreement, any Transaction and any related matter, such as claims or
disputes arising under other agreements entered into in connection with this
Agreement, including with respect to any indemnification claims. Castlight and
the Surviving Entity further agree that, as to all communications among
Gunderson and the Stockholders' Agent and the Converting Holders and their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") that
relate in any way to the Transactions, following the Effective Time, the
attorney-client privilege and the exception of client confidence belongs
solely to Castlight and may be controlled only by Castlight and shall not be
claimed by the Seller Group; provided that Castlight shall not assert such
attorney-client privilege against the Seller Group or assert any such
privileged communication (or use it as evidence) in a dispute (including a
dispute under Article IX) with any members of the Seller Group.

 ANNEX A

Earnout

1. Determination of Earnout Payments.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Earnout Payments will be determined as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Net New Bookings Earnout. If Final Net New Bookings for FY2017 equals or
exceeds $25,000,000 (the "Net New Bookings Milestone"), the Jiff Stockholders
and Jiff Optionholders will be entitled to the Bookings Earnout Payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

New Revenue Earnout. If Final New Revenue for FY2017 equals or exceeds
$25,000,000 (the "New Revenue Milestone"), the Jiff Stockholders and Jiff
Optionholders will be entitled to the Revenue Earnout Payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Castlight shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders' Agent no later than
75 calendar days after the end of FY 2017 a calculation of the Net New
Bookings and New Revenue generated during such fiscal year (the "Earnout
Statement"). Subject to the Stockholders' Agent entering into a customary
confidentiality agreement with Castlight, Castlight shall provide the
Stockholders' Agent with all relevant information (in electronic format, if
available) that the Stockholders' Agent may reasonably require to review the
Earnout Statement, including the relevant books, records and documents
Castlight, its Affiliates and/or its Representatives prepared or reviewed in
preparing such Earnout Statement, subject, in every instance, to the right of
Castlight to withhold any documents in order to preserve any legal privilege
associated with such document, including the attorney-client privilege and the
work product doctrine. In addition, Castlight shall provide the Stockholders'
Agent and its advisors with reasonable access during regular business hours to
employees of Castlight and the Surviving Entity reasonably necessary to
complete its review of such Earnout Statement. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Within 20 Business Days following delivery to the Stockholders' Agent of the
Earnout Statement, the Stockholders' Agent shall deliver a notice to Castlight
of any item or items that the Stockholders' Agent wishes to dispute (the
"Earnout Objection Notice"), together with supporting documentation,
information and calculations, including the Stockholders' Agent's calculation
of any disputed element of the Earnout Statement; provided that any final and
binding attribution of fees pursuant to subsection (iii) of the definition of
"New Bookings" or the definition of "Stipulated Value" may not be the subject
of dispute, including in the Earnout Objection Notice. Any matters not
expressly set forth in the Earnout Objection Notice shall be deemed to have
been accepted by the Stockholders' Agent on behalf of the Earnout
Participants. If, by the expiration of such 20 Business Day period, the
Earnout Objection Notice is not delivered to Castlight, or the Stockholders'
Agent has notified Castlight that there are no items that it wishes to
dispute, the draft Earnout Statement shall constitute the final Earnout
Statement and the amount of Net New Bookings and New Revenue set forth therein
shall constitute the Final Net New Bookings and Final New Revenue. 

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

If, in accordance with Section 1(c), the Earnout Objection Notice is delivered
to Castlight: 

(i) The Stockholders' Agent and Castlight shall attempt to agree in writing:
(A) the item or items disputed by the Stockholders' Agent in the Earnout
Objection Notice and (B) within 10 Business Days following the receipt of the
Earnout Objection Notice, any other item or items of which Castlight has given
notice to the Stockholders' Agent that Castlight believes are necessary to adjust as a direct consequence of the items disputed
by the Stockholders' Agent in the preceding clause (A).

(ii) If any disputed item or items are not agreed in writing between the
Stockholders' Agent and Castlight within 20 Business Days following the
delivery to Castlight of the Earnout Objection Notice, the item or items in
dispute, and only such item or items (including the supporting documentation,
information and calculations related thereto) shall be reviewed and determined
by the Reviewing Accountant. Such determination will be (x) made in accordance
with GAAP (in accordance with Castlight's historical accounting methods,
practices, policies and principles); provided that such calculation shall
account for and credit Jiff with any deferred revenue lost as a result of
purchase price accounting adjustments associated with the Merger that would
have otherwise been recognized during FY2017 had Jiff remained a stand-alone
company, and (y) with respect to any specific item, no greater than the higher
amount calculated by Castlight or the Stockholders' Agent, as the case may be,
and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Castlight or the
Stockholders' Agent, as the case may be. The Stockholders' Agent and Castlight
shall cooperate in good faith to take all reasonable action to procure the
prompt and effective appointment of the Reviewing Accountant, including
agreeing to terms of engagement with the Reviewing Accountant.

(iii) The draft Earnout Statement (which may be adjusted by mutual agreement
of Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent, or by the Reviewing Accountant's
final determination) as finally determined in accordance with this Section 1
shall constitute the final Earnout Statement and the amount of Net New
Bookings and New Revenue set forth therein shall constitute the Final Net New

The fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant for any review
pursuant to this Section 1 shall be paid (i) by Castlight in the event the
difference between the Final Net New Bookings and/or Final New Revenue, as
applicable, as determined by the Reviewing Accountant pursuant to Section
1(d)(ii) and the Net New Bookings and/or New Revenue, as applicable, set forth
in the draft Earnout Statement initially provided by Castlight pursuant to
Section 1(b) (such difference, the "Castlight Difference") is greater than the
difference between the Final Net New Bookings and/or Final New Revenue as
determined by the Reviewing Accountant pursuant to Section 1(d)(ii) and the
Net New Bookings and New Revenue set forth in the Earnout Objection Notice
(such difference, the "Stockholders' Agent's Difference"), (ii) by the Earnout
Participants if the Castlight Difference is less than the Stockholders'
Agent's Difference or (iii) equally by Castlight on the one hand, and the
Earnout Participant on the other hand, if the Castlight Difference is the same
as the Stockholders' Agent's Difference. Payment by the Earnout Participants
shall, to the maximum extent possible, be made via reduction in the Bookings
Earnout Payment and Revenue Earnout Payment otherwise payable to the Earnout
Participants (based on the Castlight Stock Price).

Castlight Obligations Regarding Earnout Payments. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in no event will Castlight be required to
operate the Jiff Business following the Effective Time in any way so as to
prioritize the generation of Net New Bookings and/or New Revenue or full
payout of the Earnout Payments over other activities that Castlight in its
commercially reasonable business judgment believes will advance the interests
of and/or increase the value of the business of Castlight, taken as a whole;
provided that likewise Castlight will not intentionally discriminate in favor
of its legacy business to the detriment of the Jiff Business. Subject to the
requirements of the preceding sentence, Castlight shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to operate the Jiff Business in such a manner so as to
achieve the Net New Bookings Milestone and the New Revenue Milestone; provided
that in no case shall such efforts obligation require Castlight to take
actions that Castlight management in good faith determines would be
detrimental to the business of Castlight, taken as a whole. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that Castlight may make, from time to time, such
business decisions as it deems appropriate in Castlight's sole discretion in
the conduct of the Jiff Business, including actions with respect to the
ownership and operation of the assets used in connection with the Jiff
Business, in each case that will or may have an impact on Net New Bookings
and/or New Revenue and/or the full payout of the Earnout Payments (it being
understood that Castlight will not take any action with respect to Net New
Bookings and/or New Revenue (x) that is not otherwise justified by Castlight's
commercially reasonable business judgment with respect to the business of
Castlight, taken as a whole or (y) with the primary intent to reduce the
likelihood of the full payout of the Earnout Payments, and no Earnout
Participant shall have any right to claim any loss with respect to the Earnout
Payments or other damages as a result of such permitted decisions. Upon the
request of the Stockholders' Agent, which request may not be made more than
two times in FY 2017, Castlight shall furnish a summary of the New Bookings
and New Revenues achieved for the most recently completed fiscal quarter of
the Surviving Entity.

Castlight Change of Control or Divestiture. To the extent there is a Castlight
Change of Control or a Castlight Divestiture, the Earnout Payments will
accelerate and become due and payable unless (a) Castlight or the Jiff Product
or Jiff Business, as applicable, is acquired by a publicly-traded entity (the
"New Acquirer"), (b) the Earnout Payments obligations are assumed by the New
Acquirer and (c) if Mr. Newell is an employee of Castlight at the time of the
Castlight Change of Control or Castlight Divestiture, Mr. Newell is offered an
opportunity to retain operational control over the sales and marketing,
professional services (including the implementations and customer success
teams) and research and development organizations (the "Specified Business
Functions") with respect to the Jiff Products or Jiff Business. Castlight
agrees that during FY2017 it will not agree to (or publicly announce an
intention to effect) a divestiture of some, but not all, Jiff Products.

Tax Treatment of the Earnout Payments. The parties agree that, for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, the Earnout Payments paid under this Annex A are
intended to be treated as consideration for shares of Jiff Capital Stock.
Shares of Castlight Class B Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Annex A
shall be treated by Castlight as issued and outstanding stock of Castlight and
the Earnout Participants shall be shown as the registered owners of such
shares on the certificate(s) evidence such shares (if such shares are
certificated).

Certain Definitions: 

"2017 Jiff Contract" means a written agreement for the sale of Jiff Products
to any customer that is entered into during the 2017 calendar year (including
agreements entered into by Jiff prior to the Closing, agreements entered into
by Castlight or its subsidiaries after the Closing and agreements with or
through a Castlight channel partner) and that remains in effect as of December 31, 2017; provided that in the event the applicable Castlight entity
and a customer reach agreement on product offering, pricing and duration terms
and conditions during the 2017 calendar year, but due to delays in the
contract documentation process, a written agreement is not executed within
2017 but is executed within 30 days thereafter, such written agreement shall
nevertheless count as a 2017 Jiff Contract (it being understood that (i) no
more than $5,000,000 of New Bookings will be counted pursuant to this proviso
and (ii) this proviso shall only be applicable with respect to a determination
regarding the Net New Bookings Milestone and not the New Revenue Milestone).

"Castlight Change of Control" means: (a) any reorganization by way of share
exchange, consolidation or merger, in one transaction or series of related
transactions (each, a "combination transaction")), in which Castlight is a
constituent corporation or is a party with another entity if, as a result of
such combination transaction, the voting securities of Castlight that are
outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such combination
transaction (other than any such securities that are held by an "Acquiring
Shareholder," as defined below) do not represent, or are not converted into,
securities of the surviving entity of such combination transaction (or such
surviving entity's parent entity if the surviving entity is owned by the
parent entity) that, immediately after the consummation of such combination
transaction, together possess at least 50% of the total voting power of all
securities of such surviving entity (or its parent entity, if applicable) that
are outstanding immediately after the consummation of such combination
transaction, including securities of such surviving entity (or its parent
entity, if applicable) that are held by the Acquiring Shareholder, (b) any
tender or exchange offer involving Castlight that would result in any person
or group acquiring or purchasing voting securities that would represent at
least 50% of the total voting power of all voting securities of Castlight or
(c) a sale, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of Castlight. For purposes of this definition, an "Acquiring
Shareholder" means a shareholder or shareholders of Castlight that (i) merges
or combines with Castlight in such combination transaction or (ii) owns or
controls a majority of the voting power of another entity that merges or
combines with Castlight in such combination transaction.

"Castlight Divestiture" means (a) any sale, exclusive license or other similar
disposition of all Jiff Products (in one or a series of related transactions)
by Castlight, any of its Affiliates or the Surviving Entity to a third party
or (b) any acquisition of the Jiff Business by a third party, whether by an
acquisition of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the Surviving
Entity (by merger, consolidation, equity sale or otherwise) or all or
substantially all of the assets used in the Jiff Business.

"Castlight Products" means all products or services produced, marketed,
licensed, sold, distributed or performed by or on behalf of Castlight and all
products or services under development by Castlight, each as of the Effective
Date.

"Castlight CS Giveaway Contract" means a written agreement for the sale of
Castlight Products to any customer that is entered into during the 2017
calendar year (including agreements with or through a Castlight channel
partner) that is entered into in connection with the renewal of a contract for
the purchase of Jiff Products, and under which Castlight Products are provided
to the customer free of charge.

"Final Net New Bookings" means the amount of Net New Bookings set forth on the
Final Earnout Statement as determined in accordance with Section 1. "Final New Revenue" means the amount of New Revenue set forth on the Final
Earnout Statement as determined in accordance with Section 1.

"FY2017" means Castlight's fiscal year 2017 (including any portion thereof
prior to the Closing).

"Jiff CS Giveaway Contract" means a 2017 Jiff Contract that is entered into in
connection with the renewal of a contract for the purchase of Castlight
Products, and under which Jiff Products are provided to the customer free of
charge.

"Jiff Marketplace Products" means products or services provided by parties
other than Jiff or its Affiliates that are sold to Jiff customers and/or their
employees and dependents through online marketplaces operated by Jiff.

"Net New Bookings" means (i) the aggregate amount of New Bookings under 2017
Jiff Contracts, less (ii) the annualized subscription fees for any Prior Jiff
Contracts that are cancelled, terminate or expire during the 2017 calendar
year, regardless of whether or not renewed, where "annualized subscription
fees" are defined as 12 times the monthly subscription fees for last full
month prior to cancellation, termination or expiration, less (iii) the
aggregate deemed value of Castlight CS Giveaway Contracts, where the deemed
value of a Castlight CS Giveaway Contract is defined as (x) 12 times the
Stipulated Value for the Castlight Products subject to the contract multiplied
by (y) the number of lives eligible to use Castlight Products under such
contract.

For clarity, in the event a Prior Jiff Contract is renewed or amended during
2017, the agreement entered into at renewal or the amended agreement shall be
considered a 2017 Jiff Contract (and thus generate New Bookings) and the
annualized subscription fees under the agreement in effect immediately prior
to renewal or amendment shall be compared to those in effect immediately
following such renewal or amendment when calculating Net New Bookings, such
that (a) an agreement that renews or is amended at a lower subscription fee
will be considered "churn" and reduce Net New Bookings by the amount of such
incremental reduction while (b) an agreement that renews or is amended at a
higher subscription fee will increase Net New Bookings by an amount equal to
the incremental increase; provided that for purposes of the foregoing
calculation any positive or negative change in the subscription fee under a
particular customer contract of 10% or less will be ignored; provided,
further, that any increase in annualized subscription fees that arises due to
an employee census change resulting in an increase in the number of lives
eligible to use the existing Jiff Products under such 2017 Jiff Contract shall
not be deemed Net New Bookings; conversely, an increase in annualized
subscription fees that arises due to (i) the addition of new Jiff Products to
the contract, (ii) the addition of existing Jiff Products to an additional
customer geography and (iii) the addition of existing Jiff Products to an
additional customer business unit or division (including as a result of
mergers and acquisitions activity by the customer) will be deemed Net New
Bookings, unless in the cases of clauses (ii)-(iii) doing so would result in
double-counting of prior bookings because such event was already contemplated
under the applicable Prior Jiff Contract and previously counted in either
Jiff's 2016 bookings or New Bookings as calculated under this Annex A.

"New Bookings" means the aggregate amount of (a) non-contingent professional
services fees and subscription fees payable by any customer during the first
12 months of a 2017 Jiff Contract whether or not actually paid during such
12-month period (for the sake of clarity, it being understood that any New
Bookings associated with the sale of Jiff Marketplace Products will be
determined on a net basis, after offsetting for amounts paid or payable by
Jiff for the associated third party products) and (b) contingent professional
services fees and subscription fees earned during 2017 under a Prior Jiff Contract or 2017 Jiff Contract whether or not actually paid during such
12-month period, in each case to the extent attributable to the Jiff Products.
For the purposes of the foregoing, fees will be considered "contingent" if (x)
they will only become payable upon the achievement of certain performance
criteria or other contingencies or (y) are subject to claw-back, repayment or
offsetting credit (sometimes referred to as "negative performance guarantees")
for the failure to achieve certain performance criteria or other
contingencies.

For purposes of determining which fees are "attributable" to Jiff Products,
the following rules shall apply:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If the customer under a 2017 Jiff Contract is purchasing only Jiff Products,
then the non-contingent professional services fees and subscription fees
payable during the first 12 months of such agreement shall be considered
attributable to Jiff Products. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If the customer under a 2017 Jiff Contract is purchasing both Jiff Products
and Castlight Products, then regardless of any specific pricing per product
set forth in such 2017 Jiff Contract, it is agreed that for purposes of
calculating New Bookings under this Agreement, the non-contingent professional
services fees and subscription fees payable during the first 12 months of such
agreement shall be apportioned between the Jiff Products and the Castlight
Products in accordance with the relative Stipulated Value of the Jiff Products
and Castlight Products purchased by the customer. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), if a 2017 Jiff Contract
meets the definition of a Jiff CS Giveaway Contract, then regardless of the
express pricing, if any, for Jiff Products stated in such contract, the amount
of New Bookings deemed attributable to such 2017 Jiff Contract will be (x) 12
times the Stipulated Value for the Jiff Products subject to the contract
multiplied by (y) the number of lives eligible to use Jiff Products under such
contract; provided that, unless Mr. Newell and the chief executive officer of
Castlight agree otherwise in writing, for purposes of calculating New Bookings
and determining the amount of Earnout Payments, no more than $2,000,000 of New
Bookings shall be attributable to Jiff CS Giveaway Contracts. 

In the event of any disagreement about how the foregoing rules should apply to
a 2017 Jiff Contract, the applicable above rules and determination of New
Bookings attributable to a 2017 Jiff Contract shall be determined, on a
quarterly basis, by mutual agreement of Mr. Newell and the Castlight chief
executive officer; provided that if such individuals are unable to reach
mutual agreement after 30 days of discussion and the resolution of the subject
of such disagreement would determine whether the Net New Bookings Milestone
would be achieved or not, then the matter shall be referred to an independent
pricing expert firm mutually agreed upon by Castlight and the Stockholders'
Agent, who shall make a final and binding determination regarding attribution.

"New Revenue" means the aggregate amount of revenue recognized by either Jiff
or Castlight during FY 2017 (determined in accordance with GAAP in accordance
with Castlight's historical accounting methods, practices, policies and
principles) that is either (i) recognized pursuant to a 2017 Jiff Contract and
attributable to Jiff Products or (ii) recognized under a customer agreement
entered into by Jiff prior to January 1, 2017 ("Prior Jiff Contracts");
provided that such calculation shall account for and credit Jiff with any
deferred revenue lost as a result of purchase price accounting adjustments associated with the Merger that would have
otherwise been recognized during FY2017 had Jiff remained a stand-alone
company.

"Stipulated Value" means, with respect to a 2017 Jiff Contract that is subject
to clause (ii) or (iii) of the definition of New Bookings, the undiscounted
market price for the applicable Jiff Products and Castlight Products, as
applicable, subject to such contract, as determined, on a quarterly basis, by
mutual agreement of Mr. Newell and the Castlight chief executive officer;
provided that if such individuals are unable to reach mutual agreement after
30 days of discussion and the resolution of the subject of such disagreement
would determine whether the Net New Bookings Milestone would be achieved or
not, then the determination of the applicable Stipulated Value shall be
referred to an independent pricing expert firm mutually agreed upon by
Castlight and the Stockholders' Agent, which expert firm shall make a final
and binding determination.
