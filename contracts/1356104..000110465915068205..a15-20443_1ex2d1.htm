this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the

shareholder of the Company, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company and all the rights,

continue unaffected by the Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies
Law.

 



 

2.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Herzog Fox and Neeman in Tel Aviv, Israel, at 10:00 a.m. (local time)
on a date to be designated by Parent and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "),
which shall be no later than the third Business Day after the later to occur
of (a) the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7 and

immediately succeeding fiscal quarter (the " _Postponed Period_ "), provided
that during the Postponed Period the Parent shall not be allowed to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(i) and the condition set forth in

2.4 _Conversion of Shares_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of
the Company:

 



 

(i) any Company Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall remain outstanding,
and no Per Share Merger Consideration or any other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(ii) any Company Shares then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent shall remain outstanding, and no Per Share Merger
Consideration or any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

 



 

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to

Company Share then outstanding shall be deemed to have been transferred to
Parent in exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Merger

outstanding Company Shares are changed into a different number, class or
category of shares by reason of any share split, division or subdivision of

reverse share split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted.

holders of certificates representing Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
shareholders of the Company; and (b) the share transfer books of the Company

shall be made on such share transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any Company
Shares (a " _Company Share Certificate_ ") is presented to the Paying Agent or
to the Surviving Company or Parent, such Company Share Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 2.6.

 



      
 

 



 

2.6 _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Payments With respect to Company Shares_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company to act as paying
agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). On or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall transfer to the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to all holders of Company
Shares (other than consideration to be paid with respect to Section 102
Shares). The cash amount so deposited with the Paying Agent is referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the cash to be paid pursuant to this Section 2 out of
the Exchange Fund. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2, Parent shall promptly deposit
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose except as expressly provided for in
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Payments With respect to Company 102 Awards_. On or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the transfer of the aggregate Vested Award
Consideration with respect to Vested Company Compensatory Awards subject to
Section 102 and the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable with
respect to the Section 102 Shares (collectively, the " _Company 102 Awards_ ")
to the Section 102 Trustee, on behalf of holders of Company 102 Awards, in
accordance with Section 102 and the Israeli Award Tax Ruling (the " _102 Award
Consideration_ "). The 102 Award Consideration shall be held in trust by the
Section 102 Trustee pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 102 and
the Israeli Award Tax Ruling, and shall be released by the Section 102
Trustee, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 102 and the
Israeli Award Tax Ruling.

 



 

(c) _Payments With respect to Vested Company Compensatory Award (other than
the Company 102 Awards)_. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the deposit of the aggregate Vested Award Consideration with respect to
Vested Company Compensatory Awards (other than the Company 102 Awards) (the "
_Other Award Consideration_ ") at one or more accounts designated by the
Company prior to the Closing for the benefit of the holders of the Vested
Company Compensatory Awards (other than Company 102 Awards). The payment to
such holders of the Other Award Consideration shall be made through the
Companys payroll system and shall be paid no later than the subsequent
scheduled payroll date.

 



 

(d) _General_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Share Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (x) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii) for the number of
Company Shares previously represented by such Company Share Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or
Parent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.6, all Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii) as
contemplated by Section 2, subject to any applicable withholding Tax as
contemplated by _Section 2.9_. If any Company Share Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition to the payment of the consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.4(a)(iii), require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Share
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit of loss and to deliver a bond
(in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender of a Company Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss and
bond as indemnity, in accordance with Section 2.6(b), in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Company Share Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for each Company
Share, the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to any applicable
withholding Tax as contemplated by _Section 2.9_, in exchange therefor
pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii) of this Agreement, to be mailed within three
Business Days following the later to occur of (x) the Paying Agents receipt
of the Exchange Fund or (y) the Paying Agents receipt of such Company Share
Certificate (or affidavit of loss and bond as indemnity, in accordance with
Section 2.6(b), in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Company Share
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled
within three Business Days.

 



 

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of the holders of
the Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Shares on the consideration
payable to such holders pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Share
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered or whose name appears on the
records of a nominee company ( _Chevra Le Rishumim_) in accordance with such
duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and reasonably satisfactory to Parent and (y) the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established, to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Company, that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

(v) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the one year anniversary
of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore surrendered their Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with this Section 2.6 shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii)
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be the owner of
any interest or other amounts earned on the Exchange Fund and Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable to any holder or
former holder of Company Shares or to any other Person with respect to any Per
Share Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.
If any Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered
prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately
before such earlier date on which Per Share Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Company share
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become
the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated for any reason and any cash has been transmitted to
the Paying Agent, such cash shall promptly be returned to Parent.

 



 

(vii) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ that (i) no such investment
shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this Agreement, including the obligation to deposit additional funds with the
Paying Agent to cover any deficiency in the Exchange Fund, as provided in
Section 2 and (ii) such investments shall be: (x) marketable obligations of,
or obligations fully and directly guaranteed by, the United States, which
obligations have a maturity of not more than 90 days; (y) repurchase
obligations with a term of not more than ten days for underlying securities of
the types described in the preceding clause (x) entered into with any bank
organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, the
commercial paper of which bank is rated A-2 or better by Standard and Poors
Ratings Group or Prime-2 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.; or (z)
money market funds (including tax-free funds) registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time, which have the highest
rating available from a nationally recognized rating agency (e.g., AAA from
Standard and Poors). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent.

 



 

2.7 _Articles of Association of the Surviving Company; Officers and Directors
of the Surviving Company_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the Articles
of Association of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Articles of Association of the Surviving Company, until duly
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the board of
directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the board of directors of the Surviving Company until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of
Association of the Surviving Company.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that from and after
the Effective Time, the individuals designated by Parent not later than ten
days prior to the Closing Date shall be the executive officers of the
Surviving Company until their successors have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Articles of Association of the Surviving Company.

 



 

2.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full right,
title and possession of and to all rights and assets of Merger Sub and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company and Parent shall
be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action.

 



 

2.9 _Withholding Tax_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and Merger Sub
(each, a " _Payor_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration paid under this Agreement such amounts as the applicable Payor
is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under any applicable Israeli or
foreign law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
such amounts are so withheld by a Payor, (i) such withheld amounts shall be
remitted by the Payor to the applicable Governmental Body prior to the last
day on which such transfer is required to be made, and (ii) such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom or to which such amounts would otherwise have been
paid. To the extent Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and Merger
Sub withholds any amounts with respect to Israeli taxes, it will issue to the
affected Person, as soon as practicable, a certificate of withholding in
customary form.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) above, with respect to
Israeli Taxes, the consideration payable to each Company Shareholder shall be
retained by the Paying Agent for the benefit of each such Company Shareholder
for a period of up to one-hundred eighty (180) days from Closing, unless
Parent or Paying Agent is otherwise instructed explicitly by the ITA (the "
_Withholding Drop Date_ ") (during which time no Payor shall make any payments
to any Company Shareholder and withhold any amounts for Israeli Taxes from the
payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided below and
during which time each Company Shareholder may obtain a Valid Tax
Certificate). If a Company Shareholder delivers, no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date a Valid Tax Certificate to
Payor, then the deduction and withholding of any Israeli Taxes shall be made
only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate and the
balance of the payment that is not withheld shall be paid to such Company
Shareholder concurrently therewith subject to any non-Israeli withholding
which is applicable to the payment (if any). If any Company Shareholder (i)
does not provide Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate, by no later than three
(3) Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date, or (ii) submits a written
request with Payor to release his portion of the consideration prior to the
Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Valid Tax Certificate at or before
such time, then the amount to be withheld from such Company Shareholders
portion of the consideration shall be calculated according to the applicable
withholding rate as reasonably determined by Parent which amount shall be
increased by the interest plus linkage differences as defined in Section 159A
of the Israeli Tax Ordinance for the time period between the fifteenth (15th)
calendar day of the month following the month during which the Closing occurs
and the time the relevant payment is made.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Any withholding made in New Israeli Shekels with respect to payments made
hereunder in dollars shall be calculated based on a conversion rate in such
manner as the Payor reasonably determines to be in compliance with applicable
Law and any currency conversion commissions will be borne by the applicable
payment recipient and deducted from payments to be made to such payment
recipient.

(e) The Company is a "foreign private issuer" as such term is defined in Rule
3b-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company has established and
maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2014,
such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their findings in their most recent evaluation, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls, if any, and (ii) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls, if any. The Company has
made available to Parent (x) a summary of any such disclosure made by the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Company Board and (y) any
material communication made by management or the Companys auditors to the
audit committee of the Company Board required or contemplated by applicable
listing standards or professional accounting standards during the period
commencing January 1, 2013. The principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the Acquired Company Reporting Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are complete and correct. The management of the Company has
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2014,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

Acquired Company IP Contract or Contracts, which are material, pursuant to
which any Intellectual Property Right or Technology is licensed, sold,

Acquired Company IP Contract or Contracts is or are, as the case may be,
exclusive or nonexclusive.

 



 

(c) Part 3.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies as of
the date of this Agreement each material Acquired Company IP Contract pursuant
to which any Person has been granted any license under, or otherwise has
received or acquired any right, whether or not currently exercisable, or
interest in, any Owned Acquired Company IP. No Acquired Company is bound by,
and no Owned Acquired Company IP is subject to, any Contract containing any
covenant or other provision that materially restricts the ability of any
Acquired Company to use, assert, enforce, or otherwise exploit any Owned
Acquired Company IP anywhere in the world. Except as set forth in Part 3.9(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Company has transferred
ownership of, whether a whole or partial interest, or granted any exclusive
right to use, any Owned Acquired Company Intellectual Property or Owned
Acquired Company Technology to any Person.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in Part 3.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Acquired Companies exclusively own all right, title, and interest to and in
the Owned Acquired Company IP free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than
Permitted Liens. Each employee, officer, director, Contractor and consultant
of the Acquired Companies who has contributed to the creation or development
of any Acquired Company Products, Owned Acquired Company IP or Owned Acquired
Company Technology for or on behalf of the Acquired Companies has signed a
valid and enforceable agreement that includes (i) confidentiality obligations
in favor of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, and (ii) an effective and valid assignment to the Acquired Companies
of all right, title and interest in and to all Intellectual Property Rights
and Technology created or developed by such Person as a result of or during
such Persons employment by or engagement with the Acquired Companies related
to the Business (including the rights to transfer, license, amend and modify
such Intellectual Property Rights) (collectively, the " _Invention Assignment
Agreements_ "). The Company has provided or made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of all Invention Assignment Agreements. To the
extent any Intellectual Property Rights covered by an Invention Assignment
Agreement relates to Registered IP in which any Acquired Companies has an
ownership interest, and to the extent provided for by, and in accordance with,
applicable Laws, the applicable Acquired Company has recorded such Invention
Assignment Agreements or other documents sufficient to evidence the assignment
of such Intellectual Property to the Acquired Company, as applicable and
appropriate, with the relevant Governmental Body such that such Registered IP
are in the name of the Company with no break in the chain of title. No
employee, officer, director, Contractor or consultant of the Acquired
Companies has excluded any Intellectual Property Rights from any Invention
Assignment Agreement executed by such Person in connection with such Persons
employment by or engagement with the Company. To the Companys Knowledge, no
shareholder, officer, director, employee, consultant or Contractor of an
Acquired Company has any claim, right (whether or not currently exercisable),
or ownership interest in any Owned Acquired Company IP. To the Companys
Knowledge, no employee of any of the Acquired Companies is (a) bound by or
otherwise subject to any Contract restricting him from performing his duties
for any of the Acquired Companies, (b) in violation of any term of any
employment, consulting, invention assignment agreement, patent disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, non-solicitation Contract with an
Acquired Company or (c) in breach of any Contract with any former employer or
other Person concerning Intellectual Property Rights or confidentiality due to
his activities as an employee of any of the Acquired Companies. To the
Companys Knowledge, the Acquired Companies have paid, in full, all mandatory
compensation to employees, officers, directors, Contractors and consultants in
relation to all Owned Acquired Company IP and Owned Acquired Company
Technology, if any, and neither this Agreement nor any transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will result in any further amounts being
payable to any current or former employees, officers, directors, Contractors
or consultants of the Company in relation to any Owned Acquired Company IP or
Owned Acquired Company Technology.

 



 

(e) Part 3.9(e) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate
list of all material Contracts pursuant to which any of the Acquired Companies
is obligated to pay royalties, fees, commissions, and other similar payments
for the manufacture, sale, or distribution of any Acquired Company Product or
the use of any Acquired Company IP or Acquired Company Technology. To the
Companys Knowledge, no Person who has licensed Technology or Intellectual
Property Rights to the Acquired Companies has an ownership interest in or
license rights to any derivative works or improvements made by the Acquired
Companies to such Technology or Intellectual Property Rights that are
incorporated into any Acquired Company Product.

 



 

(f) None of the Acquired Companies has (i) transferred ownership of, or
granted any exclusive license or exclusive right under or with respect to, or
authorized the retention of any exclusive right with respect to or joint
ownership of, any Intellectual Property that is or was at any time owned or
purported to be owned by the Acquired Companies to any other Person or (ii)
permitted the Acquired Companies rights in any Owned Acquired Company

 



      
 

 



 

IP to lapse or enter the public domain except where the Company has in its
reasonable business judgment decided to cancel, abandon, allow to lapse or
enter the public domain or otherwise not to renew such issuance, registration
or application. As a result of giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, no current or former director, equity holder, officer,
employee, Contractor or consultant of the Acquired Companies will own or
retain any rights to use any of the Owned Acquired Company IP (other than,
with respect to employees, Contractors and consultants, the right to use such
Owned Acquired Company IP within the scope of such Persons employment by or
engagement with the Company).

 



 

(g) To the Companys Knowledge, all Owned Acquired Company IP is valid,
subsisting and enforceable and the Acquired Companies have made all filings
and payments and taken all other actions required to be made or taken to
maintain each item of Owned Acquired Company IP that is Registered IP in full
force and effect by the applicable deadline and otherwise in accordance with
all applicable Legal Requirements to the extent such actions, if not taken,
would result in such Registered IP being rendered invalid or unenforceable. No
interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, or other Legal Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, in which
the scope, validity, or enforceability of any Owned Acquired Company IP is
being contested or challenged. No application for a Patent or a material
Copyright, mask work, or Trademark registration or any other type of
application or registration for any material Registered IP filed by or on
behalf of any of the Acquired Companies since January 1, 2013 has been
abandoned, allowed to lapse, or rejected. To the Companys Knowledge, none of
the Acquired Companies has engaged in patent or copyright misuse or any fraud
or inequitable conduct in connection with any Registered IP. To the Companys
Knowledge, the Acquired Companies have complied with their duty of candor and
disclosure and have made no material misrepresentations in the filings
submitted to the applicable Governmental Authorities with respect to all
patents included in the Owned Acquired Company IP. To the Companys Knowledge,
no Trademark owned, used, or applied for by any of the Acquired Companies
conflicts or interferes with any Trademark owned, used, and applied for by any
other Person. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event or circumstance
(including a failure to exercise adequate quality controls and an assignment
in gross without the accompanying goodwill) has occurred or exists that has
resulted in the abandonment of any material Trademark (whether registered or
unregistered) owned, used, or applied for by any of the Acquired Companies.
The original, first and joint inventors of the subject matter claimed in each
of the Company Patents are properly named as inventors of such Company
Patents, and the applicable Laws governing marking of products covered by the
inventions in each of the Company Patents have been complied with in all
material respects. To the Knowledge of the Company, other than prior art
references cited in the applicable patent office file history of the Company
Patents (true, correct and complete copies of which the Company has provided
or made available to Parent), there are no prior art references that could
invalidate any Company Patents or any claim thereof. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no prior public uses, sales, offers for sale or disclosures
that could invalidate any Company Patents or any claim thereof and there has
been no conduct that could render any Company Patents or any claim thereof
invalid or unenforceable.

 



 

(h) To the Companys Knowledge, no Person has infringed, misappropriated, or
otherwise violated, and no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating,
or otherwise violating, any Acquired Company IP that is incorporated into an
Acquired Company Product.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Neither the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions or agreements contemplated by this

give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare, (i) a loss of,
license to or Encumbrance on, any Acquired Company IP; (ii) a breach of,
termination of, or acceleration or modification of any right or obligation
under any Contract listed or required to be listed in Parts 3.9(b) or 3.9(c)

(k) To the Companys Knowledge, no Acquired Company has infringed,
misappropriated, or violated any Intellectual Property Right of any other
Person or is currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property Right of any other Person. No infringement,
misappropriation, or similar claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened in writing against any Acquired Company or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, against any Person who may be entitled to be
indemnified or reimbursed by any Acquired Company with respect to such claim
or Legal Proceeding. Since January 1, 2013, no Acquired Company has received
any written notice relating to any actual, alleged, or suspected infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another

respective Representatives to immediately cease any and all existing
discussions, communications or negotiations with any Persons (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives) conducted heretofore with
respect to, or any that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an

with it or any of its affiliates or any Acquired Company or any of their

Person or any of such Persons affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of such
Persons or such Persons affiliates or Subsidiaries Representatives in
connection with such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition
Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 5.4, the Company agrees that
none of the Acquired Companies shall, and it shall not authorize or permit the
Acquired Companies Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate, support or induce any
inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any
Acquisition Proposal or any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Transaction, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding or relating to, or
furnish to any Person any nonpublic information that would reasonably be
expected to be used for the purposes of formulating or with respect to, or
take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person as to
the existence of these provisions, (iv) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend
to its shareholders or any other Person any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter

understanding providing for or contemplating any Acquisition Proposal or a

Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of the Acquired Companies, or
afford to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent
or Merger Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of
the Acquired Companies, in each such case that has made, submitted or
announced, or would reasonably be expected to make, submit or announce, or
with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or the
intent to encourage, facilitate or assist the making, submission or
announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.4_ by the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Representatives shall be deemed a breach
of this Agreement by the Company.

 



 

(c) Promptly, but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, after receipt by
the Company or any of the Acquired Companies of any Acquisition Proposal or
any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which the Company reasonably
believes would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the
Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.
After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company
shall promptly (and with respect to any changes to any such Acquisition
Proposal in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the
occurrence of such changes) keep Parent informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including any amendments or proposed amendments
(including any withdrawal thereof)) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry.

 



 

(d) If, in the absence of any violation of _Sections 5.4(a) \- (c)_, after
the date hereof and prior to the Company General Meeting, (y) the Company
receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (for purposes
of the procedures set forth in this Section 5.4(d), any Acquisition Proposal
received prior to the date hereof and which is still outstanding as of the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof shall be deemed to have been received immediately after execution
and delivery hereof and any amendment to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal) which constitutes or may
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Company Board has concluded in
good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel, and after taking
into account the legal, financial, fiduciary and other aspects of such
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, that the failure to take
some or all of the actions set forth in clause (i) or clause (ii) below with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders
under the Israeli Companies Law and, in addition, in order to determine the
appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary obligations, the
Companys board of directors may also consider and act on the basis of
Delaware Legal Requirements, the Company shall promptly, but in any event in
less than twenty-four hours following the time of such conclusion (but in any
event at least twenty-four hours prior to taking the actions set forth in (i)
and (ii) below), provide to Parent written notice that shall state expressly
(A) that it has received an Acquisition Proposal which constitutes or may
constitute a Superior Proposal, (B) that the Company Board has made the
conclusions set forth in clause (z) above and (C) the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in
which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof including any
modifications thereto) (such notice, the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") and
may then take the following actions:

 



 

(i) make available nonpublic information to the third party making such
Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ , that (x) prior to so making available, the
Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms no more favorable to the third party than the terms under
that certain agreement dated June 1, 2015 between the Company and Parent (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, (y) subject to applicable antitrust
laws and regulations relating to the exchange of information,
contemporaneously with making available any such nonpublic information to such
third party, the Company makes available a copy of such nonpublic information
to Parent hereunder (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously so made available); and

 



 

(ii) engage in discussions and/or negotiations with the third party with
respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after compliance by
the Company with this Section 5.4(e), the Company Board may (y) withhold or
withdraw the Company Board Recommendation or (z) approve, adopt, endorse or
recommend to its shareholders a Superior Proposal (any of the foregoing
actions, whether by the Company Board or a committee thereof, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "), only if all of the following conditions are met:

 



 

(i) the Company General Meeting has not occurred;

 



 

(ii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after effecting all
required actions under subsection (iii) below and based on advice of its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure
of the board of directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its shareholders under the
Israeli Companies Law and, in addition, in order to determine the appropriate
standards that would apply to such fiduciary obligations, the Companys board
of directors may also consider and act on the basis of Delaware Legal
Requirements; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) the Company Board has (x) provided to Parent three Business Days prior
written notice of its intent to effect a Change of Recommendation (which
notice shall include reasonable details of the applicable Superior Proposal
and the manner in which it intends to effect the Change of Recommendation),
provided that such three Business Day period shall be extended for an
additional three Business Days following each modification of the financial or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal so long as the Company Board
determines that such modified proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal, (y) subject to applicable antitrust laws and regulations relating to
the exchange of information, made available to Parent all materials and
information made available to the Person making the Superior Proposal in
connection with such Superior Proposal, and (z) for such three (3) Business
Day period (plus each applicable extension) following the delivery to Parent
of such notice and the provision of the materials and information referred to
in (y) above, if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its
Representatives available to discuss with Parents Representatives any
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
Company from making such disclosures as are necessary or required, based on
the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, by Israeli or U.S. federal
securities laws; provided that any such disclosure that constitutes a Change
of Recommendation will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the provisions of Section 9.

 



 

(g) The Company shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and its and
their respective Representatives not to, enter into any Contract with any
Person that would restrict the Companys ability to provide to Parent the
information described in Section 5.4(c), and neither the Company nor any of
the Acquired Companies is currently party to or bound by any Contract that
prohibits the Company from providing the information described in Section
5.4(c) to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify, or grant permission
under, or fail to enforce, any standstill, non-compete, non-solicitation or
confidentiality provision in any Contract to which it or any of the Acquired
Companies are or become a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than any such Contract with Parent or Merger Sub).

 



 

5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) for purposes of all Company Share Plans, Benefit Plans and employment
agreements, as applicable.

 



 

(b) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) provide each
employee who was employed by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time and continues to be employed by the Company throughout the Effective Time
and thereafter by the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Company (" _Continuing Employee_ ") with employee benefits (excluding equity
based benefits, but including allocations to provident funds and education
funds) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other
employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Nothing in the foregoing shall prevent the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating the employment or amending
the employment terms (including any existing policy) of any Continuing
Employee at any time following the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) To the extent that a Company Plan or Parent Plan is made available to any
Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation and sick leave accrual and
severance pay entitlement); provided, however, that such service need not be
credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
employee benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans to the
extent coverage under any such Parent Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each Parent
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits to any continuing employee, the Surviving Company shall make its best
effort to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions,
evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar
requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such continuing employee and
his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Company shall make its best
effort to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Company Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding Parent Plan begins to be given full credit under such Parent
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Parent Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of
such Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan which is a flexible spending
plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under
the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation, sick leave or paid time off
accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be credited to such continuing employee following the
Effective Time, and, subject to the last sentence of subsection (b) above,
shall be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture as were in the
applicable Company Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective date.

 



 

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any employee by the Company, Parent, or its Affiliates or the
Surviving Company or under any benefit plan which the Company, Parent or its
Affiliates or the Surviving Company may maintain.

 



      
 

 



 

5.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub._ Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

 



 

5.7 _Companies Registrar_. The Company shall take all reasonable efforts to
effect all necessary filings with the Companies Registrar for the purpose of
updating the information with respect to each of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

Section 6. _Additional Covenants of the Parties_.

 



 

6.1 _Merger Proposal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, (a) the Company and Merger Sub shall
cause a merger proposal (in the Hebrew language) in the form of Exhibit A (the
" _Merger Proposal_ ") to be executed in accordance with Section 316 of the
Israeli Companies Law and filed with the Companies Registrar, and (b) the
Company shall call the Company General Meeting. Each of the Company and Merger
Sub shall cause a copy of the Merger Proposal to be delivered to each of their
secured creditors no later than three days after the date on which the Merger
Proposal is delivered to the Companies Registrar, and shall promptly inform
its non-secured creditors of the Merger Proposal and its contents in
accordance with Section 318 of the Israeli Companies Law. Promptly after the
Company and Merger Sub shall have complied with the preceding sentence, the
Company and Merger Sub shall inform the Companies Registrar, in accordance
with Section 317(b) of the Israeli Companies Law, that notice was given to
their respective creditors under Section 318 of the Israeli Companies Law. In
addition to the above, each of the Company and, if applicable, Merger Sub,
shall (i) publish a notice to its creditors, stating that a Merger Proposal
was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review the
Merger Proposal at the office of the Companies Registrar, the Companys
registered offices or Merger Subs registered offices, as applicable, and at
such other locations as the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, may
determine, in (A) two daily Hebrew newspapers circulated in Israel, on the day
that the Merger Proposal is submitted to the Companies Registrar, (B) a
newspaper circulated in New York City, no later than three Business Days
following the day on which the Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies
Registrar, and (C) in such other manner as may be required by applicable law
and regulations; (ii) within four Business Days from the date of submitting
the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar, send a notice by registered
mail to all of the "Substantial Creditors" (as such term is defined in the
regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law) of which the Company
or Merger Sub, as applicable, is aware, in which it shall state that a Merger
Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may
review the Merger Proposal at such additional locations, if such locations
were determined in the notice referred to in subsection (i) above; (iii) send
to the "workers committee" or display in a prominent place at the Companys
premises, a copy of the notice published in a daily Hebrew newspaper (as
referred to in subsection (i)(A) above), no later than three Business Days
following the day on which the Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies
Registrar; (iv) not later than two days after the date on which the approval
of the Merger by the Companys shareholders at the Company General Meeting is
received, the Company shall (in accordance with Section 317(b) of Israeli
Companies Law and the regulations thereunder) inform the Companies Registrar

 



      
 

 



 

of such approval, and (v) in accordance with the customary practice of the
Companies Registrar, the Company and Merger Sub shall request, following
coordination with Merger Sub, that the Companies Registrar declares the Merger
effective and issue the Certificate of Merger upon such date as the Company
and Merger Sub shall advise the Companies Registrar. For the avoidance of
doubt, and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it
is the intention of the Parties that the Merger shall be declared effective
and the Certificate of Merger shall be issued on the Closing Date, as a
condition to the Closing taking place. For purposes of this _Section 6.1_,
"business day" shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Regulations
5760-2000 promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law.

 



 

6.2 _Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no
event later than the earlier of fourteenth (14th) Business Day after the date
hereof or prior to the filing or furnishing of any proxy statement in
connection with any other Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall prepare
the Proxy Statement and cause all required filings to be filed with the ISA
and furnished to the SEC. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts (i) to
cause the Proxy Statement to comply with all applicable Legal Requirements and
(ii) to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and any
comments of the ISA or its staff. Prior to filing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or modification thereto) with the ISA or the SEC, the Company (x)
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any drafts of the Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings, (y)
shall consider in good faith to include in such drafts, correspondence and
filings all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, and (z) to the extent
reasonably practicable and not prohibited under applicable Law, the Company
and its outside legal counsel shall permit Parent and its outside counsel to
participate in all communications, if any, with the ISA, the SEC or NASDAQ, or
their respective staff, as applicable (including all meetings and telephone
conferences) relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. If any event relating to any of the Acquired Companies
occurs, or if the Company becomes aware of any information, that should be
disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then the
Company shall promptly inform Parent thereof and the Company shall, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.2 prepare such
amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and to
the extent required by applicable Law, cause such amendment or supplement to
be promptly distributed to the shareholders of the Company. The Company shall
not include in the Proxy Statement any information with respect to Parent or
its Affiliates, unless the form and content thereof shall have been consented
to in writing by Parent prior to such inclusion and Parent agrees to provide
any such information required to be so included under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Except in the case of a Change of Recommendation, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation and a copy (in
its entirety) of any fairness opinion obtained by the Company Board in
connection with the approval by the Company Board of the Merger.

 



 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as
practicable following its filing date.

 



      
 

 



 

6.3 _Company General Meeting_.

 



 

(a) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, but in no
event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date hereof, the
Company shall take all action necessary or required under all applicable Legal
Requirements to publish the notice of the Companys shareholders meeting for
voting upon the proposal to approve the Merger (the " _Company General
Meeting_ "). Subject to the notice requirements of the Israeli Companies Law
and the Articles of Association of the Company, the Company General Meeting
shall be held (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent)
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in any event
no later than 35 days after the date of the notice to the Company General
Meeting. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection
with the Company General Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements and shall otherwise comply with all Legal
Requirements applicable to such meeting. Except in the case of a Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall not permit the adjournment or postponement
of the Company General Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
provided, however, that if Parent so requests, the Company shall adjourn or
postpone the Company General Meeting for a period of up to 14 days. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Company General Meeting, the
Company shall not, except in the case of a Change of Recommendation, change
such record date or establish a different record date for the Company General
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent unless required to do so
by applicable Law (including, in the event that the Company General Meeting is
adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Section 6.3(a), by implementing
such adjournment or postponement in such a way that the Company does not
establish a new record date for the Company General Meeting, as so adjourned
or postponed, to the extent permissible under applicable Law).

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 5.4, the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to
the effect that the Company Board recommends that the Companys shareholders
vote to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions at the
Company General Meeting (the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys shareholders vote to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions being referred to as the " _Company Board Recommendation_
"). Subject to Section 5.4, the Company Board Recommendation shall not be
withdrawn, qualified or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no
resolution by the Company Board or any committee thereof to withdraw, qualify
or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall
be adopted.

 



 

(c) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company
General Meeting in accordance with Section 6.3(a) shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, it shall not submit to the
vote of the Companys shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction prior to the vote of the Companys shareholders with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger at the Company General Meeting; provided,
however, that nothing shall, upon a Change of Recommendation, prohibit the
Company from submitting the Merger and the Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction to the vote of the Companys shareholders at the same general
meeting of shareholders of the Company.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The Company shall, through the Company Board, use reasonable commercial
efforts to solicit from the Company shareholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and to obtain the Required Company Shareholder
Vote. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent
on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date
of the Company General Meeting (unless otherwise agreed to by Parent) as to
the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Required Company Shareholder Vote. In the event that Parent, or any Person
referred to in Section 320(c) of the Israeli Companies Law shall cast any
votes in respect of the Merger, Parent shall, and with respect to any Person,
if Parent is aware of such vote it shall, prior to such vote, disclose to the
Company the respective interests of Parent or such Person in such shares so
voted.

 



 

6.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Each party to this Agreement shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver and file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, each notice, report or other document required to be delivered by
such party to or filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect
to the Merger, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by
such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject to Section 6.8(b):

 



 

(i) the Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general or other
Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters; and

 



 

(ii) the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Consents set
forth in Schedule 6.4(a)(ii), and any other Consents that may be required in
connection with the Merger.

 



 

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall (i) give the other parties prompt
notice of the commencement of any investigation or Legal Proceeding by or
before any Governmental Body with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or that would otherwise prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), (ii) keep the other parties informed as
to the status of any such investigation or Transaction Litigation and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any
Governmental Body regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement will consult and
reasonably cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any investigation or Legal Proceeding relating to
the Merger (including any Transaction Litigation); provided that, to the
extent permissible under applicable law, Parent shall also have the right to
participate in the defense of any such Transaction Litigation and the Company
shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any
investigation or Legal Requirement, in connection with any such investigation
or Legal Proceeding under or relating to any antitrust or fair trade or merger
control law, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the
other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such
investigation or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Body in connection with any such investigation or Legal
Proceeding.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the parties shall
prepare and prefile a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the Exon-Florio
Amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C. app. § 2170, as
amended (" _Exon-Florio_ ") with respect to the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. No earlier than five Business Days thereafter, but as soon as
practicable after the parties receipt of comments or other feedback from
CFIUS on the prefiled notice, the parties shall formally file a joint
voluntary notice pursuant to Exon-Florio with respect to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall provide CFIUS with any
additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS or its member
agencies during the Exon-Florio review process that is reasonably available to
the parties as promptly as practicable, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide that information within the amount of time allowed by
CFIUS. The parties, in cooperation with each other, shall take all
commercially reasonable steps advisable, necessary or desirable to finally and
successfully complete the Exon-Florio review process as promptly as
practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, as a condition to receiving
written confirmation by CFIUS that it has completed its review (or, if
applicable, investigation) and determined that there are no unresolved
national security concerns with respect to the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, be required to agree to sell, divest, dispose of or hold
separate any material assets or businesses, or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause it to incur any
material cost or expense. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
to the extent requested by CFIUS, Parent shall, and shall cause any Affiliate
of Parent designated by CFIUS to, become a party to the National Security
Agreement, dated October 27, 2014, among the Company, Tilera Corporation (now
known as EZchip Semiconductor, Inc.) and the U.S. Government, represented by
the Department of Defense and the Office of Science and Technology Policy as
lead agencies on behalf of CFIUS, or enter into a substantially similar
agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Company Compensatory Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option and Company RSU (each
such award, a " _Company Compensatory Award_ ") which is not vested and, as
applicable, exercisable and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but excluding Company Compensatory Awards which vest and
become exercisable as a result of the Merger) (each, a " _Unvested Company
Compensatory Award_ "), shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically
at the Effective Time into an option or, restricted share unit award, as the
case may be, denominated in Parent Ordinary Shares and which has other terms
and conditions substantially identical to those of the related Company
Compensatory Award except that (i) the number of Parent Ordinary Shares
subject to each such award shall be determined by multiplying the number of
Company Shares subject to such Unvested Company Compensatory Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the " _Award Exchange Ratio_ "),
the numerator of which is the Per Share Merger Consideration and the
denominator of which is the average closing price of a Parent Ordinary Share
on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. over the five (5) trading days immediately
preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs
(rounded up to the

 



      
 

 



 

nearest whole share) (the " _Assumed Consideration_ ") and (ii) if applicable,
the exercise or purchase price per Parent Ordinary Share (rounded downwards to
the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase
price per Company Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Unvested
Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
(y) the Award Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in no case shall the
exchange of a Company Option be performed in a manner that is not in
compliance with the applicable adjustment requirements of Section 424 and
Section 409A of the Code. From and after the Effective Time, all Unvested
Company Compensatory Awards shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of an Unvested Company Compensatory Award shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto or arising therefrom, except the right
to receive the Assumed Consideration payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.5 shall restrict any holder of a Company
Compensatory Award from exercising any vested portion of the Company
Compensatory Award into Company Shares, at any time prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each Company Compensatory Award, which is
vested and, as applicable, exercisable and that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including Company Compensatory Awards of non-
employee members of the Company Board and other holders of Company
Compensatory Awards, which vest and become exercisable as a result of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each a " _Vested
Company Compensatory Award_ "), shall, be canceled at the Effective Time and
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, an amount in cash,
without interest thereon, determined by multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price (if any)
of such Vested Company Compensatory Award, by (2) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Vested Company Compensatory Award (the " _Vested Award
Consideration_ "). Payment of such Vested Award Consideration shall be subject
to all applicable deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld
in respect of such payment. From and after the Effective Time, all Vested
Company Compensatory Awards shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Vested Company Compensatory Award shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto or arising therefrom, except the right to
receive the Vested Award Consideration payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the exercise price per Company Share for any Vested Company
Compensatory Award is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Vested Company Compensatory Award shall be canceled
immediately prior to the Effective Time without payment of consideration. The
amount of cash each holder of Vested Company Compensatory Award is entitled to
receive for the Vested Company Compensatory Award held by such holder shall be
rounded up to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for
all Vested Company Compensatory Awards held by such holder.

 



 

(c) The Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to provide
that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award
or any participant in any Company Share Plan, or other Benefit Plan or
employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement
shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Company Shares, any interest in
Company Shares (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) or
any other interest in the equity of the Acquired Companies, any of their
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Share Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions to effect the provisions of Section 6.5.

 



 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
and no later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company
shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants, in coordination
with Parent and its advisors, to prepare and file with the Israel Tax
Authority an application for a ruling in relation to the assumption by Parent
of Company Compensatory Awards granted to Israeli employees, service providers
and officers of the Company which will provide, among other things that: (i)
the assumption of the Unvested Company Compensatory Awards will not result in
a taxable event with respect to such Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to
Section 3(i) of the Israeli Tax Ordinance or Section 102, and with respect to
such Unvested Company Compensatory Awards subject to Section 102 that tax
continuity shall apply including with regard to the requisite holding period
which will be deemed to have begun at the time of the grant of Company
Compensatory Awards and with regard to the classification of the gain; (ii)
the payments made in respect to Shares issued upon exercise or vesting of
Vested Company Compensatory Awards granted under the capital gains route of
Section 102 and held by the Section 102 Trustee, shall not constitute a
violation of Section 102 if deposited with the Section 102 Trustee and
released only after the lapse of the minimum trust period required by Section
102 (the " _102 Trust Period_ "); and (iii) Parent and anyone acting on its
behalf shall be exempt from withholding tax in relation to any payments made
to the Section 102 Trustee or the Paying Agent; (which ruling may be subject
to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (the "
_Israeli Award Tax Ruling_ "). Each of Company and Parent shall cause their
respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all
activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation
and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli
Award Tax Ruling. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable law to obtain the Israeli Award Tax Ruling, as promptly as
practicable. To avoid doubt, the final text of the Award Tax Ruling or the
Interim Award Ruling shall be subject to the prior written confirmation of
Parent or its counsel, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Israeli Award Tax Ruling is not granted prior
to Closing, the Company shall seek to receive prior to the Closing an interim
tax ruling confirming that Parent and anyone acting on its behalf shall be
exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation to any payments made to the
Section 102 Trustee (the " _Interim Award Ruling_ "). In the event that the
Israeli Award Tax Ruling has not been received by the Closing, Parent shall
delay the assumption of the Company Compensatory Awards held by Israeli
residents until receipt of either the Israeli Award Tax Ruling or a separate
confirmation from the Israel Tax Authority that the assumption will not
constitute a tax event in Israel. In the event that the Israeli Award Tax
Ruling has not been received within 180 days of the Closing, and unless
otherwise instructed by the Israel Tax Authority, Parent will assume the
Company Compensatory Awards as provided above and shall withhold any amount
that may be required under law.

 



      
 

 



 

Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of Unvested
Company Compensatory Award at the Effective Time, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of Purchaser Ordinary Shares, as is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by _Section 6.5(a)_. Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (to the
extent available) with respect to the Purchaser Ordinary Shares subject to
such assumed Unvested Company Compensatory Award and shall have such
registration statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Date (but not later than 10 Business Days following
the Effective Date). Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the
Company Compensatory Awards remain outstanding. In addition, Parent shall seek
to obtain an exemption from the ISA in connection with the assumption of the
Unvested Company Compensatory Award.

 



 

6.6 _Tax Ruling_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, the
Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to
prepare and file with the Israel Tax Authority an application in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent for a ruling, in coordination with
Parent and its advisors, that (i) with respect to non-Israeli residents (as
defined in the Israeli Tax Ordinance or as will be determined by the Israel
Tax Authority), (A) exempting Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company
and their respective agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at the
source from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement, including the Per Share Merger Consideration, or clarifying
that no such obligation exists, or (B) clearly instructing Parent, the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents on how such
withholding at the source is to be executed, and in particular, with respect
to the classes or categories from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the
rate or rates of withholding to be applied and how to identify any such non-
Israeli residents; and (ii) with respect to Israeli residents (as defined in
the Israeli Tax Ordinance or as will be determined by the Israel Tax
Authority) (other than Section 102 Shares) (x) exempting Parent, the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents from any obligation
to withhold Israeli Tax at the source from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including the Per Share
Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation exists, or (y)
clearly instructing Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and their
respective agents on how such withholding at the source is to be executed, and
in particular **,** with respect to the classes or categories from which Tax
is to be withheld (if any), the rate or rates of withholding to be applied
(the " _Withholding Tax Ruling_ "). Each of the Company and Parent shall cause
its respective Israeli counsel to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate
with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such
application and in the preparation of any written or oral submission that may
be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Withholding Tax Ruling. To the
extent that prior to the Closing an interim Withholding Tax Ruling shall have
been obtained, then all references herein to the Withholding Tax Ruling shall
be deemed to refer to such interim ruling, until such time that a final
definitive Withholding Tax Ruling is obtained.

 



 

6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to fulfill and honor the obligations of the Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements listed in Part 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule between the Company, on the one hand, and the officers and directors
of the Company and the other Acquired Companies (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "), on the other hand (the " _Indemnification
Agreements_ "), which agreements shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, and any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of
expenses provisions under the Articles of Association of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof; _provided_ that such obligations
shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time by Legal
Requirements.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Articles of Association of the Surviving Company to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification and exemption that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as those contained in the Companys Articles of
Association as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of seven years from the
Effective Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
Indemnified Persons thereunder, unless such modification is required by Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(c) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right
to purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering the persons who were directors and officers of the Company and the
other Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect
to their acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, and that by
its terms shall provide coverage until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, such purchase shall be in consultation with Parent and, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall work with Parents insurance brokers in
connection with the purchase of such "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policy. In the event the Company purchases such "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policy prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to)
maintain such "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy in
full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder for so long as such "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent and/or the Surviving Company set forth in this Section
6.7.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.7 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. Parent shall pay all expenses,
including attorney fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations under this Section 6.7, to the
extent such Indemnified Person shall be the prevailing party in the
enforcement action.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 6.4(a) and Section 6.8(b), Parent and the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Section 6.4 and Section 6.8(b), each party to this
Agreement (i) shall make all deliveries and filings (if any) and give all
notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the
Merger. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such
delivery or filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent obtained

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose or
transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any

assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue
offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired

Property Right; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold
separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date),
or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to hold separate any
assets or operations; (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any
commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future
operations or the future operations of any of the Acquired Companies; or (vi)
to contest, defend or appeal any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger if
Parent determines in good faith that contesting, defending or appealing such
Legal Proceeding might not be advisable.

 



 

6.9 _Disclosure_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing any public
release or making any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without derogating the foregoing,
each party shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, make
any disclosure regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless (a) the other Party shall have consented
to such disclosure (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), or (b) such Party shall have been advised in writing
by its outside legal counsel that such disclosure is required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Each party agrees to promptly make available to the other
Parties copies of any written public communications made without prior
consultation with the other Parties.

 



 

6.10 _Resignation of Directors_. If instructed in writing by Parent prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each director of each of the
Acquired Companies to cease serving as a director effective as of the
Effective Time.

enable the delisting of the Company Shares from NASDAQ and TASE and the

Surviving Company is required to file with or furnish to the SEC any reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective

to Parent, at least seven (7) Business Days (with respect to the Companys
annual report on Form 20-F) or two (2) Business Days (with respect to the
Companys immediate reports on Form 6-K, unless a shorter period is required
under applicable Law) prior to (i) the filing or furnishing date of such
