As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence under the name "CYS Investments, Inc." under the laws of the State of Maryland as the surviving corporation (in such capacity, the Company is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall be an indirect, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 2.2 _ Closing._ 

  

  

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing"), shall take place at 9:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on a date that is two Business Days following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver in accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived in accordance with this Agreement on the Closing Date) at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York, or such other place as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing. For purposes of this Agreement "Closing Date" shall mean the date on which the Closing occurs. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "Maryland Department") articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") in connection with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the MGCL, and the parties shall make all other filings or recordings required under the MGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the Maryland Department or such later date (not to exceed 30 days after the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the Maryland Department) and time as 

  

      

  

shall be agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Articles of Merger (such date and time the Merger becomes effective, the
"Effective Time").

  

  

 2.3 _ Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the MGCL, including Section 3-114 thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 2.4 _ Organizational Documents._ At the Effective Time, and as part of the Merger, the corporate charter of the Company will be amended and restated to read in the form attached hereto as _Annex B-1_, and as so amended and restated shall be the corporate charter of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended, subject to Section 6.10(b), in accordance with its respective terms and applicable law. In addition, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to read in the form attached hereto as _Annex B-2_, and as so amended and restated shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended, subject to Section 6.10(b), in accordance with their respective terms and applicable law. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall take all actions necessary to amend and restate the bylaws of the Company, as aforesaid, as of the Effective Time. 

  

 2.5 _ Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ From and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall serve until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 2.6 _ Directors of Parent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary corporate action so that upon and immediately after the Effective Time, the size of the Parent Board is increased by two members, and each of James A. Stern and Karen Hammond (each, a "Company Director Designee") are appointed to the Parent Board. In the event that either or both James A. Stern and Karen Hammond are unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board prior to the Effective Time, then a substitute shall be designated by the Company on the earlier to occur of (i) five Business Days after the date that such Company Director Designee is determined to be unable to serve or informs the Company that he or she is unwilling to serve and (ii) the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, which substitute member shall be deemed to be a Company Director Designee for purposes of this Agreement. Each Company Director Designee must (i) satisfy the director qualification standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines of Parent, (ii) meet the qualifications of an "independent director" under the rules of the NYSE and (iii) provide to Parent the information required by Article II, Section 11 of the Company\'s Amended and Restated Bylaws regarding such Company Director Designees, are elected or appointed to the Parent Board to fill the vacancies on the Parent Board created by such increase to serve until the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing or until their successors are elected and qualified. The provisions of this _Section 2.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Director Designees. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 2.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of the Company Director Designees unless (a) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (b) the Company Director Designees have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Company Director Designees shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 2.6_). 

  

 2.7 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a taxable sale of the Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock in 

        

exchange for the Common Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger
Consideration immediately followed by (b) the liquidiation of the Company for
U.S. federal income tax purposes governed by Sections 331 and 336 of the

ARTICLE III 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND 
MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE 

  

 3.1 _ Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company: 

  

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ All of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into 100 shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _ Capital Stock of the Company._ 

    

 (i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Cancelled Shares, as defined below), shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent (A) that number of validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Per Share Stock Consideration") and (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration (the "Common Merger Consideration"). As used in this Agreement, "Exchange Ratio" means a quotient (rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth) determined by dividing (1) (x) the Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share, multiplied by (y) 96.75% by (2) (x) the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share, multiplied by (y) 94.20%, in each case as determined in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ and as such number may be adjusted in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_. 

  

 (ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(i)_, shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Common Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_ and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_, in each case, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with _Section 3.3_. 

  

 (iii) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_, (A) each share of the Company\'s 7.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Company Series A Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of Parent Series D Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Series D Merger Consideration") and (B) each share of the Company\'s 7.50% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Company Series B Preferred Stock" and, together with the Company Series A Preferred Stock, the "Company Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive one newly 

   

      

   

issued share of Parent Series E Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Series E
Merger Consideration" and, together with the Preferred Series D Merger
Consideration, the "Preferred Merger Consideration").

   

 (iv) All such shares of Company Preferred Stock, when so converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(iii)_, shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Preferred Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Preferred Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such share of Company Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3_. 

  

 (v) All shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor (collectively, the "Cancelled Shares"). 

    

 (c) _ Determination of Exchange Ratio._ 

    

 (i) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the Determination Date, each Calculating Party shall prepare and deliver to the Receiving Party a Proposed Book Value Schedule, together with such supporting documentation that the Receiving Party may reasonably request. The Proposed Book Value Schedule of Company shall include, and the Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share shall reflect, the value of the asset(s) set forth on _Schedule 3.1(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as determined by an Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm (defined below) applying the guidelines set forth on _Schedule 3.1(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and conducted prior to the Determination Date; provided, however, that (A) nothing in this _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ shall prohibit Company from selling or otherwise disposing the asset(s) set forth on _Schedule 3.1(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter for fair market value prior to the Determination Date and (B) the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm for purposes of this _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ shall be borne by Parent. 

  

 (ii) Within three (3) Business Days of the delivery of each Proposed Book Value Schedule, the Receiving Party shall notify the Calculating Party whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the Proposed Book Value Schedule. In the event that the Receiving Party disputes the accuracy of the Proposed Book Value Schedule, the Receiving Party shall notify the Calculating Party in reasonable detail of those items and amounts as to which the Receiving Party disagrees and shall set forth the Receiving Party\'s calculation of such disputed amounts (a "Dispute Notice"), and the Receiving Party shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Proposed Book Value Schedule. In the event that the Receiving Party notifies the Calculating Party that it accepts the Proposed Book Value Schedule or does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the Calculating Party during such three Business Day period, the Receiving Party shall be deemed to have accepted the accuracy of the Proposed Book Value Schedule, and the calculations of the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share or Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share set forth therein shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties. 

   

 (iii) If a Dispute Notice shall be timely delivered by the Receiving Party pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ above, then the Calculating Party and the Receiving Party shall forthwith jointly request that a mutually agreed upon nationally recognized registered independent public accounting firm or a nationally recognized independent valuation expert (in either case, the "Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm"), make a binding determination only as to the items set forth in the Dispute Notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The 

   

      

   

Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm will, under the terms of its
engagement, be required to render its written decision with respect to such
disputed items and amounts within four (4) Business Days from the date of
referral. The Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Proposed Book Value Schedule as to which
the Receiving Party and the Calculating Party are in disagreement. The
Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm shall deliver to the Receiving Party
and the Calculating Party a written report setting forth its adjustments, if
any, to the Proposed Book Value Schedule based on the Independent Accounting
or Valuation Firm\'s determination with respect to the disputed items and
amounts in accordance with this Agreement and the Calculation Principles and
such report shall include the calculations supporting such adjustments;
_provided_ , that for each item as to which the Calculating Party or the
Receiving Party are in disagreement, the Independent Accounting or Valuation
Firm shall assign a value for each such item no greater than the
higher amount, and no less than the lower amount, calculated or proposed by
the Calculating Party or the Receiving Party with respect to such item, as the
case may be. Such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties, and neither party nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives will seek recourse to any courts, other tribunals or
otherwise, other than to enforce the determination of the Independent
Accounting or Valuation Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting or Valuation Firm for purposes of this _Section 3.1(c)(iii)_
shall be shared equally by the parties.

  

 (iv) Subject to _Section 6.12_, as soon as practicable (but not more than two (2) Business Days) following the final determination of the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share, the Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share and the Exchange Ratio, Parent and the Company shall make a joint public statement to disclose the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration (the "Exchange Ratio Announcement"). 

    

 (d) _ Adjustment to Merger Consideration._ The Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable), subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

  

 3.2 _ Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Restricted Stock._ Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any outstanding award of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (the "Company Restricted Stock") granted pursuant to the Company\'s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Company Equity Plan"), shall immediately vest and any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Company Restricted Stock shall immediately lapse and, immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are required to effectuate the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock pursuant to the terms of _Section 3.2(a)_, and to take all actions reasonably required to effectuate any provision of _Section 3.2(a). _

  

       

 3.3 _ Payment for Securities; Exchange._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the Company\'s transfer agent to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") and to receive the Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. On the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, for issuance in accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and (ii) the number of shares of applicable Parent Preferred Stock issuable to the holders of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Parent agrees to deposit with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund (as hereinafter defined). Except as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_ and Sections _3.3(g)_ and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund. 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ 

    

 (i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of (1) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable (the "Certificates") or (2) shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), in each case, which shares were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, (A) a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing (it being understood that the forms of Letter of Transmittal to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock may vary in certain respects due to differences in the respective securities) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 3.1_. 

   

      

   

 (ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ (which shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_. 

    

 (c) _ Termination of Rights._ All Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, in each case paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing Cancelled Shares), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the 365th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former Company Stockholders who have not theretofore received the applicable Merger Consideration to which they are entitled under this _Article III_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which they are entitled 

  

      

  

pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, in each case without interest thereon, shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of
their claim for such amounts.

  

 (e) _ No Liability._ None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which the applicable Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _ Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing Cancelled Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount, pursuant to the policies and procedures of the transfer agent for Parent, as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h) _and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_. 

  

 (g) _ Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (h) _ No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock._ No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for 

  

      

  

exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of
a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the average of the volume weighted average
prices of one share of Parent Common Stock for the five consecutive trading
days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder), the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

   

 (i) _ Withholding Taxes._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from (A) the consideration to be paid by Parent, Eiger Partnership or the Exchange Agent hereunder and (B) any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted or withheld shall be paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

  

 (j) _ Dissenters\' Rights._ No dissenters\' or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, including the consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, with respect to consummation of the Merger, to (i) the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with, and acceptance for record by, the Maryland Department.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, including the consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of Parent (subject to obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval) and Merger Sub, subject, with respect to consummation of the Merger, the filing of the Articles of Merger with, and acceptance for record by, the Maryland Department. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due and valid execution of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors\' Rights.

As of their respective filing dates, or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such amendment made prior to the date hereof, each of the Parent SEC Documents, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained, when filed or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment with respect to those disclosures that are amended, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The Company will promptly request that each Prior Company Bidder in possession of nonpublic information that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in connection with its consideration of any potential Company Competing Proposal return or destroy all such nonpublic information heretofore furnished to such Prior Company Bidder and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Prior Company Bidder. 

  

      

  

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party.

  

 (b) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 6.3_, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and will instruct its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage the making of a Company Competing Proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company Competing Proposal, (iii) furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries, or access to the properties, assets or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to any Person in connection with or in response to a Company Competing Proposal, (iv) enter into any binding or nonbinding letter of intent or agreement in principle, or other agreement providing for a Company Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as provided in _Section 6.3(d)(ii)_), (v) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly approve or adopt, any Company Competing Proposal, (vi) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or (vii) fail publicly to reaffirm without qualification the Company Board Recommendation within five Business Days after the written request of Parent following a Company Competing Proposal that has been publicly announced (or such fewer number of days as remain prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, as it may be adjourned or postponed) (the taking of any action described in _clauses (v) _, _(vi)_ or _(vii)_ of this _Section 6.3(b)_ being referred to as a "Company Change of Recommendation"). 

  

 (c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall advise Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Company Competing Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement or any request for non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made by any Person in connection with a Company Competing Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations with the Company or a Representative of the Company relating to a Company Competing Proposal (in each case within one Business Day thereof), and the Company shall provide to Parent (within such one Business Day time frame) either (i) a copy of any such Company Competing Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Company Competing Proposal, if not made in writing. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and current basis with respect to the status and material terms of any such Company Competing Proposal and any material changes to the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, may: 

    

 (i) make such disclosures as the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith are necessary to comply with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or other applicable securities laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company,  the Company Board or any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3(d)(iii)_ or _Section 6.3(e)_, effect a Company Change of Recommendation in any disclosure document or communication filed or publicly issued or made in conjunction with the compliance with such requirements; 

  

 (ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, engage in the activities prohibited by _Sections 6.3(b)(ii)_ and _6.3(b)(iii)_ with any Person if (1) the Company receives a written, _bona fide_ Company Competing Proposal from such Person that was not solicited at any time following the execution of this Agreement and (2) such Company Competing 

   

      

   

Proposal did not arise from a material breach of the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no non-public
information that is prohibited from being furnished pursuant to _Section
6.3(b)_ may be furnished until the Company receives an executed
confidentiality agreement from such Person containing limitations on the use
and disclosure of nonpublic information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company that are no less favorable to the Company in the
aggregate than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by
the Company Board in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel; _provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality agreement does
not contain provisions that prohibit the Company from complying with the
provisions of this _Section 6.3_, and (B) prior to taking any such actions,
the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Company Competing Proposal is, or is reasonably expected to lead to,
a Company Superior Proposal;

   

 (iii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Company Competing Proposal from a third party that was not solicited at any time following the execution of this Agreement and did not arise from a material breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.3_, if the Company Board so chooses, cause the Company to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, if prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Company Competing Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent in response to such Company Competing Proposal), and (B) the Company shall have given notice to Parent that the Company has received such proposal in accordance with _Section 6.3(c)_, specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and, that the Company intends to take such action, and either (1) Parent shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Company Stockholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on which such notice is given to Parent, or (2) if Parent within the period described in the foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Company Competing Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal with respect to Parent\'s revised proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each time material modifications to the financial terms of a Company Competing Proposal determined to be a Company Superior Proposal are made, the time period set forth in this _clause (B)_ prior to which the Company may effect a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended for two Business Days after notification of such change to Parent; and 

  

 (iv) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, seek clarification from (but not engage in negotiations with or provide non-public information to) any Person that has made a Company Competing Proposal that was not solicited at any time following the execution of this Agreement solely to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide adequate information for the Company Board or any committee thereof to make an informed determination under _Section 6.3(d)(ii)_. 

    

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, other than in response to a Company Competing Proposal (which is addressed in _Section 6.3(d)(iii)_), to make a Company Change of Recommendation if, prior to taking such action, (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its legal duties as directors under applicable Law, (ii) the 

  

      

  

Company shall have given notice to Parent that the Company intends to effect
a Company Change of Recommendation (which notice will reasonably describe the
reasons for such Company Change of Recommendation), and either (A) Parent
shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on
which such notice is given to Parent, or (B) if Parent within the period
described in the foregoing _clause (A)_ shall have proposed revisions to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good
faith that such proposed changes do not obviate the need for the Company Board
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation and that the failure to make
a Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its legal
duties as directors under applicable Law.

  

  

 6.4 _ No Solicitation by Parent._ 

  

  

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and instruct its Representatives to (i) immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any discussion or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives with respect to a Parent Competing Proposal (any such Persons and their Affiliates and Representatives with respect to a Parent Competing Proposal being referred to as "Prior Parent Bidders") and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary.

 6.5 _ Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of Parent Capital Stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company will promptly furnish to Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of Company Capital Stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Registration Statement (including the Joint Proxy Statement) and any amendments or supplements thereto. 

  

 (b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company 

  

      

  

Stockholders Meeting and the holders of Parent Common Stock at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part).
The Company and Parent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable
and Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly
after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each
of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent will
(i) provide the other with an opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response), (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such
document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to documents filed by a party that
are incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information
relating to the other party, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, their
business, financial condition or results of operations or the transactions
contemplated hereby; and _provided_ , _further_ that the Company, in
connection with any Company Change of Recommendation, or Parent, in connection
with any Parent Change of Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint
Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference) and make other
filings with the SEC, to effect such Company Change of Recommendation or
Parent Change of Recommendation, as applicable.

  

 (c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. 

  

 (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders and the Parent Stockholders.

 6.10 _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as defined below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise (which shall be assumed by Parent and the Surviving Corporation), from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise (the "Indemnified Persons") against and from all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys\' and other professionals\' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding 

  

      

  

is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified
Persons may retain the Company\'s regularly engaged legal counsel or other
counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to assist in the defense
of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.10_, upon learning of any
such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so
to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have
under this _Section 6.10_ except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such party\'s position with respect to such claims). With respect
to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this _Section
6.10_, such Indemnified Person shall have the right to require that such
determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as
applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
who has not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving
Corporation, the Company or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3)
years.

  

 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would affect) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in _Section 6.10(a)_, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Person\'s rights under this _Section 6.10_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract in the event such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder. 

  

 (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall put in place, and fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance") with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company\'s existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of (for any one year) 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance as of the date of this Agreement; and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to facts, acts, events or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

   

 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such 

  

      

  

consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or
otherwise dispose of any of their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or the Surviving
Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this _Section 6.10_.
The provisions of this  _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to
indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_, and his heirs and representatives. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.10_ are in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.10_.

  

  

 6.11 _ Stockholder Litigation._ Each party shall give the other party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall consider in good faith the other party\'s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , that the Company shall not agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 6.12 _ Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by the parties. From and after the date hereof, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates or Subsidiaries, nor the Parent Manager, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such party\'s capital stock is traded to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions, including the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto or (b) in the case of the Company or Parent, it deems it necessary or appropriate to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions in connection with or following a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation, respectively; _provided, however_ , each party and their respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.12_. 

  

 6.13 _ Control of Business._ Without limiting in any way any party\'s rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other party and their respective Subsidiaries\' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\' respective operations. 

  

 6.14 _ Transfer Taxes._ All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid 50% by the Company and 50% by Parent, whether levied on Parent or any other Person, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes, including supplying in a timely manner a complete list of all real property interests held by the Company that are located in New York State and any information 

        

with respect to such property that is reasonably necessary to complete such
Tax Returns. The portion of the consideration to be received by holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger that is allocable to the
real property of the Company and its subsidiaries in New York State shall be
determined by Merger Sub in its reasonable discretion.

   

 6.15 _ Notification._ The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, (a) of any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) of any Proceeding commenced or, to any party\'s knowledge, threatened against, such party or any of its Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such party or any of its Affiliates, in each case, in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other Transaction ("Transaction Litigation"), and (c) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of Parent, respectively, which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party. 

  

 6.16 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 6.17 _ Listing Application._ Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock, the Parent Series D Preferred Stock and the Parent Series E Preferred Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare a dividend to its stockholders, the payment date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date, subject to funds being legally available therefor. The record date for such dividends shall be 

  

      

  

three (3) Business Days before the payment date. The per share dividend
amount payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.19(a)_ shall be an
amount equal to (i) the Company\'s then-most recent quarterly dividend (on a
per share basis), multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last
dividend record date through and including the day prior to the Closing Date,
and divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such

Dividend Amount"), if any, necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable is
equal to the Minimum Distribution Dividend. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in good faith to determine whether it is necessary to authorize and
declare a Company Additional Dividend Amount and the amount (if any) of the
Company Additional Dividend Amount.

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall declare a dividend to its stockholders, the payment date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date, subject to funds being legally available therefor.

The per share dividend amount payable by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.19(b)_ shall be an amount equal to (i) Parent\'s then-most recent quarterly dividend (on a per share basis), multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date through and including the day prior to the Closing Date, and divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared, plus (ii) an additional amount (the "Parent Additional Dividend Amount") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Company Additional Dividend Amount (if any) by the Exchange Ratio. 

  

  

 6.20 _ Takeover Laws._ The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other Transactions.

without first obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

  

 9.13 _ Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, either the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party hereunder; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent and Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 Section 3. _ SPECIAL MEETINGS._ Each of the chief executive officer, president and Board of Directors may call a special meeting of stockholders. A special meeting of stockholders shall be held on the date and at the time and place set by the chief executive officer, president or Board of Directors, whoever has called the meeting.

 Any business of the Corporation may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders without being specifically designated in the notice, except such business as is required by any statute to be stated in such notice.

 Section 6. _ QUORUM; ADJOURNMENTS._ At any meeting of stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting on any matter shall constitute a quorum; but this section shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the charter of the Corporation (the " _Charter_ ") for the vote necessary for the approval of any matter. If, however, such quorum is not established at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting _sine die_ or from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. 

  

 The stockholders present either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has been duly called and at which a quorum has been established, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal from the meeting of enough stockholders to leave fewer than would be required to establish a quorum. 

        

 Section 7. _ VOTING._ A plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a director. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted, without any right to cumulative voting. A majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast is required by statute or by the Charter. Unless otherwise provided by statute or by the Charter, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. Voting on any question or in any election may be _viva voce_ unless the chairman of the meeting shall order that voting be by ballot or otherwise. 

  

 Section 8. _ PROXIES._ A holder of record of shares of stock of the Corporation may cast votes in person or by proxy executed by the stockholder or by the stockholder\'s duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by law. Such proxy or evidence of authorization of such proxy shall be filed with the secretary before or at the meeting.

 Section 9. _ VOTING OF STOCK BY CERTAIN HOLDERS._ Stock of the Corporation registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, general partner, managing member or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock. Any director or fiduciary may vote stock registered in the name of such person in the capacity of such director or fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.

 Section 14. _ RATIFICATION._ The Board of Directors or the stockholders may ratify and make binding on the Corporation any action or inaction by the Corporation or its officers to the extent that the Board of Directors or the stockholders could have originally authorized the matter. Moreover, any action or inaction questioned in any stockholders\' derivative proceeding or any other proceeding on the ground of lack of authority, defective or irregular execution, adverse interest of a director, officer or stockholder, non-disclosure, miscomputation, the application of improper principles or practices of accounting or otherwise, may be ratified, before or after judgment, by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, and if so ratified, shall have the same force and effect as if the questioned action or inaction had been originally duly authorized, and such ratification shall be binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders and shall constitute a bar to any claim or execution of any judgment in respect of such questioned action or inaction.

Unless otherwise determined by an officer of the Corporation, the owner of such lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, shall be required, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, to give the Corporation a bond in such sums as it may direct, and/or provide the Corporation with a written indemnity, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation.

Such date, in any case, shall not be prior to the close of business on the day the record date is fixed and shall be not more than 90 days and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than ten days, before the date on which the meeting or particular action requiring such determination of stockholders of record is to be held or taken. 

   

 When a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been set as provided in this section, such record date shall continue to 

        

apply to the meeting if adjourned or postponed, except if the meeting is
adjourned or postponed to a date more than 120 days after the record date
originally fixed for the meeting, in which case a new record date for such

7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 

  

 Two Harbors Investment Corp., a Maryland corporation (the " _Corporation_ "), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that: 

  

 FIRST: Under a power contained in Article VI of the charter of the Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), the Board of Directors (the " _Board of Directors_ ") of the Corporation, by duly adopted resolutions classified and designated 3,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Corporation (" _Preferred Stock_ ") as shares of 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Series D Preferred Stock_"), with the following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, which, upon any restatement of the Charter, shall become part of Article VI of the Charter, with any necessary or appropriate renumbering or relettering of the sections or subsections hereof. 

  

 1. _Designation and Number_. A series of Preferred Stock, classified as the "7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock" is hereby established. The number of authorized shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be 3,000,000. 

   

 2. _Maturity_. The Series D Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless (i) the Corporation decides to redeem or otherwise repurchase the Series D Preferred Stock or (ii) the Series D Preferred Stock becomes convertible and is actually converted pursuant to _Section 7_ hereof. The Corporation is not required to set aside funds to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock. 

   

 3. _Ranking_. The Series D Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, (i) senior to all classes or series of the common stock of the Corporation, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), and to all other equity securities issued by the Corporation other than equity securities referred to in _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this _Section 3_; (ii) on a parity with the Corporation\'s 8.125% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Corporation\'s 7.625% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Corporation\'s 7.25% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Corporation\'s 7.50% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, and all other all equity securities issued by the Corporation with terms specifically providing that those equity securities rank on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; and (iii) junior to all equity securities issued by the Corporation with terms specifically providing that those equity securities rank senior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities. 

  

 4. _Dividends_. 

  

  

 (a) Holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board and declared by the Corporation, out of funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 7.75% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $1.9375 per annum per share). Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock shall accumulate daily and shall be cumulative from, and including, [July 15, 2018](1) and shall be payable for each subsequent quarterly dividend 

    (1)

period, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and
October (each, a " _Dividend Payment Date_ "); provided, that if any Dividend
Payment Date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the dividend which
would otherwise have been payable on that Dividend Payment Date may be paid on
the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if paid on
such Dividend Payment Date and no interest, additional dividends or other sums
will accumulate on the amount so payable for the period from and after
such Dividend Payment Date to such next succeeding Business Day. Any dividend
payable on the Series D Preferred Stock, including dividends payable for any
partial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of
record as they appear in the stock records of the Corporation for the Series
D Preferred Stock at the close of business on the applicable record date,
which shall be the first day of the calendar month, whether or not a Business
Day, in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls (each, a " _Dividend
Record Date_ "). The dividends payable on any Dividend Payment Date shall
include dividends accumulated to, but not including, such Dividend Payment
Date.

  

   

 (b) No dividends on shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at any time when the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to any indebtedness of the Corporation, prohibit the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof or provide that the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof would constitute a breach of the agreement or a default under the agreement, or if the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of those dividends and whether or not those dividends are declared. No interest, or sum in lieu of interest, will be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series D Preferred Stock which may be in arrears, and holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends described in _Section 4(a)_ hereof. Any dividend payment made on the Series D Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock. 

  

 (d) Except as provided in _Section 4(e)_ hereof, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, (i) no dividends (other than in shares of Common Stock or in shares of any series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, (ii) no other distribution shall be declared or made upon shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, and (iii) any shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation shall not be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Corporation that it may issue ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation and for transfers made pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Corporation of shares of any class or series of stock pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of 

  

      

  

the Charter to preserve its status as a REIT (as defined in the Charter) for
federal income tax purposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made
on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred
Stock and any Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on a
parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation.

  

 (e) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series D Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series D Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series D Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series D Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the Series D Preferred Stock and accumulated or accrued dividends per share on such other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such Preferred Stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series D Preferred Stock which may be in arrears. 

   

 (f) "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. 

  

 (g) "Set apart for payment" shall be deemed to include, without any action other than the following: the recording by the Corporation in its accounting ledgers of any accounting or bookkeeping entry which indicates, pursuant to an authorization by the Board and a declaration of dividends or other distribution by the Corporation, the allocation of funds to be so paid on any series or class of shares of stock of the Corporation; provided, however, that if any funds for any class or series of stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends are placed in a separate account of the Corporation or delivered to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent, then "set apart for payment" with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock shall mean placing such funds in a separate account or delivering such funds to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent. 

  

  

 5. _Liquidation Preference_. 

  

  

 (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid out of the assets the Corporation has legally available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation it may issue ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, a liquidation preference of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that it may issue that ranks junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights. 

  

 (b) In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation that it may issue ranking on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and all other such classes 

  

      

  

or series of capital stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of
assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would
otherwise be respectively entitled.

  

 (c) Holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to written notice of any such liquidation no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the payment date. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other entity with or into the Corporation, or the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 

  

 (d) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of stock of the Corporation or otherwise, is permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Corporation\'s total liabilities. 

  

  

 6. _Redemption_. 

  

  

 (a) The Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\' written notice, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. 

  

 (b) Special Optional Redemption Right. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\' written notice, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 6_, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will not have the Change of Control Conversion Right (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the shares called for redemption. 

  

 (c) A "Change of Control" is deemed to occur when, after the effective time of the merger of CYS Investments, Inc., a Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, the following have occurred and are continuing: (i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of capital stock of the Corporation entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of the total voting power of all capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Corporation (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and (ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in _clause (i)_, neither the Corporation nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing such securities) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), the NYSE Amex Equities (the " _NYSE Amex_ ") or the Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE Amex or Nasdaq. 

  

      

  

 (d) In the event the Corporation elects to redeem Series D Preferred Stock, the notice of redemption will be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption at such holder\'s address as it appears on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates (if any) for the Series D Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on the redemption date; (vi) whether such redemption is being made pursuant to _Section 6(a)_ or _Section 6(b)_ hereof; (vii) if applicable, that such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control and, in that case, a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; and (viii) if such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control, that the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock being so called for redemption will not be able to tender such shares of Series D Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control and that each share of Series D Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is called, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If less than all of the Series D Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of redemption will be required where the Corporation elects to redeem Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VII of the Charter to preserve its REIT status for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 (e) Holders of shares Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the Series D Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid dividends payable upon the redemption following the surrender. 

   

 (f) If notice of redemption of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock has been given and if the Corporation irrevocably sets apart for payment the funds necessary for redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date (unless the Corporation shall default in providing for the payment of the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any), dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series D Preferred Stock, those shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption. 

   

 (g) If any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the redemption price and accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption may be paid on the next Business Day and no interest, additional dividends or other sums will accumulate on the amount payable for the period from and after that redemption date to that next Business Day. 

  

 (h) If less than all of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares) or by any other equitable method the Corporation shall determine that will not result in the automatic transfer of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock to a trust pursuant to Article VII of the Charter (as to restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares of the Corporation\'s capital stock). 

  

      

  

 (i) Immediately prior to any redemption of Series D Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, unless a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case each holder of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this _Section 6(i)_, the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed. 

  

 (j) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or contemporaneously is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series D Preferred Stock (except by exchanging them for its capital stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Corporation of shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VII of the Charter to preserve its REIT status for federal income tax purposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock. 

  

 (k) Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may purchase shares of Series D Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement. Any shares of Series D Preferred Stock that the Corporation acquires may be retired and re-classified as authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of Preferred Stock. 

  

  

 7. _Conversion Rights_. Shares of Series D Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except as provided in this _Section 7_. 

  

  

 (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series D Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to _Section 6_, in which case such holder will have the right only with respect to shares of Series D Preferred Stock that are not called for redemption) to convert some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder (the " _Change of Control Conversion Right_ ") on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of Series D Preferred Stock (the " _Common Stock Conversion Consideration_ ") equal to the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series D Preferred Stock plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) thereon to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date for the Series D Preferred Stock, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (y) the Common Stock Price (as defined below) (such quotient, the 

  

      

  

" _Conversion Rate_ "); and (ii) [ * ](2) (the " _Share Cap_ "),
subject to adjustments provided in _Section 7(b)_ below.

   

 (b) The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Stock to existing holders of Common Stock), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a " _Share Split_ ") with respect to Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable or deliverable, as applicable, in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right will not exceed the product of the Share Cap times the aggregate number of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Change of Control Conversion Date (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the " _Exchange Cap_ "). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap. 

  

 (c) The "Change of Control Conversion Date" is the date the Series D Preferred Stock is to be converted, which will be a Business Day selected by the Corporation that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which it provides the notice described in _Section 7(h)_ to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock. 

  

 (d) The "Common Stock Price" is (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per share of Common Stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which Common Stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by Pink OTC Markets Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if Common Stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. 

   

 (e) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Stock is or will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the " _Alternative Form Consideration_ "), a holder of Series D Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Form 

    (2)

 NTD: Share cap to be adjusted to preserve the economics of the Crest preferred. Formula would be: New Share Cap is equal to (A) Share Cap, multiplied by (B) a fraction in which (i) the numerator is equal to the sum of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (y) the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) the TWO stock price as of closing (using the average of the closing sale prices per share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the Closing Date) and (ii) the denominator is the TWO stock price as of closing (using the average of the closing sale prices per share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the Closing Date). 
      

  

Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive
upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to
the effective time of the Change of Control (the " _Alternative Conversion
Consideration_ "; the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the
Alternative Conversion Consideration, whichever shall be applicable to a
Change of Control, is referred to as the " _Conversion Consideration_ ").

  

   

 (f) If the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion Consideration in respect of such Change of Control will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders of a plurality of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an election (if electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be, and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Change of Control. 

  

 (g) No fractional shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock in connection with a Change of Control will be issued. Instead, the Corporation will make a cash payment equal to the value of such fractional shares based upon the Common Stock Price used in determining the Common Stock Conversion Consideration for such Change of Control. 

  

 (h) Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, provided that the Corporation has not exercised its right to redeem all shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof, the Corporation will provide to holders of Series D Preferred Stock a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, which notice shall be delivered to the holders of record of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock in their addresses as they appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series D Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem all or any shares of Series D Preferred Stock, holders will not be able to convert the shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption and such shares will be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series D Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent, transfer agent and conversion agent for the Series D Preferred Stock; (ix) the procedures that the holders of Series D Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right (including procedures for surrendering shares for conversion through the facilities of a Depositary (as defined below)), including the form of conversion notice to be delivered by such holders as described below; and (x) the last date on which holders of Series D Preferred Stock may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal. 

  

 (i) The Corporation shall also issue a press release containing such notice provided for in _Section 7(h)_ hereof for publication on Dow Jones and Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), and post a notice on its website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first business day following any date on which it provides the notice provided for in _Section 7(h)_ hereof to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock. 

  

      

  

 (j) To exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates (if any) representing the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer (or, in the case of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a Depositary, to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted through the facilities of such Depositary), together with a written conversion notice in the form provided by the Corporation, duly completed, to its transfer agent. The conversion notice must state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock. 

   

 (k) Holders of Series D Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the transfer agent of the Corporation prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal delivered by any holder must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series D Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated Series D Preferred Stock has been surrendered for conversion, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series D Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the holder\'s conversion notice. 

  

 (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Sections 7(j)_ and _(k)_ hereof, if any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") or a similar depositary (each, a " _Depositary_ "), the conversion notice and/or the notice of withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures, if any, of the applicable Depositary. 

  

 (m) Series D Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 6_, in which case only the shares of Series D Preferred Stock properly surrendered for conversion and not properly withdrawn that are not called for redemption will be converted as aforesaid. If the Corporation elects to redeem shares of Series D Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such shares of Series D Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date the redemption price as provided in _Section 6_ hereof. 

  

 (n) The Corporation shall deliver all securities, cash and any other property owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered on conversion will be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as of the Change of Control Conversion Date. 

  

 (o) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion Right, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or other property. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series D Preferred Stock, no holder of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of such shares of Common Stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the applicable share transfer and ownership 

  

      

  

limitations contained in Article VII of the Charter, unless the Corporation
provides an exemption from this limitation to such holder pursuant to Article
VII of the Charter.

  

 (p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are the holders of record of shares of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. Except as provided in this _Section 7(p)_, the Corporation will make no allowance for unpaid dividends that are not in arrears on the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted. 

  

  

 8. _Voting Rights_. 

  

  

 (a) Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as set forth in this _Section 8_. On each matter on which holders of Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, each share of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote, except that when shares of any other class or series of the Preferred Stock have the right to vote with the Series D Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, the Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of each such other class or series will have one vote for each $25.00 of liquidation preference (excluding accumulated dividends). 

  

 (b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors constituting the Board will be automatically increased by two (if not already increased by two by reason of the election of directors by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and with which the Series D Preferred Stock is entitled to vote as a class with respect to the election of those two directors) and the holders of Series D Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series D Preferred Stock in the election of those two directors, will be entitled to vote for the election of those two additional directors at a special meeting called by the Corporation at the request of the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock or by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series D Preferred Stock in the election of those two directors (unless the request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, in which case, such vote will be held at the earlier of the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation), and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Series D Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment. In that case, the right of holders of the Series D Preferred Stock to elect any directors will cease and, unless there are other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of any directors elected by holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board shall be reduced accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the total number of directors elected by holders of the Series D Preferred Stock (voting as a single class with all other classes or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series D Preferred 

  

      

  

Stock in the election of such directors) pursuant to the voting rights under
this _Section 8_ exceed two.

   

 (c) If a special meeting at a place within the United States designated by the Corporation is not called by the Corporation within 30 days after request from the holders of Series D Preferred Stock as described in _Section 8(b)_ hereof, then the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock may designate a holder to call the meeting at the expense of the Corporation and such meeting may be called by the holder so designated upon notice similar to that required for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the place within the United States designated by the holder calling such meeting. The Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses of calling and holding any meeting and of electing directors pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ hereof, including, without limitation, the cost of preparing, reproducing and mailing the notice of such meeting, the cost of renting a room for such meeting to be held, and the cost of collecting and tabulating votes. 

  

 (d) If, at any time when the voting rights conferred upon the Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ hereof are exercisable, any vacancy in the office of a director elected pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ shall occur, then such vacancy may be filled only by the remaining such director or by vote of the holders of record of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock and any other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series D Preferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to _Section 8(b)_. Any director elected or appointed pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ may be removed only by the affirmative vote of holders of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock and any other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which classes or series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as a class with the Series D Preferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to _Section 8(b)_, such removal to be effected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock and any such other classes or series of Preferred Stock, and may not be removed by the holders of the Common Stock. 

  

 (e) So long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, voting together as a single class with all series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up or reclassify any of the authorized capital stock of the Corporation into such shares, or create or authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares; or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock (each, an " _Event_ "); provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any Event set forth in _clause (ii)_, so long as the Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that, upon an occurrence of an Event, the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of any such Event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and, provided further, that any increase in the amount of the authorized Common Stock or Preferred Stock, including the Series D Preferred Stock, or the creation or issuance of any additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock or other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of such series, 

  

      

  

in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series D Preferred
Stock that the Corporation may issue with respect to payment of dividends or
the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall
not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,
privileges or voting powers.

  

 (f) The voting rights provided for in this _Section 8_ will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which voting by holders of the Series D Preferred Stock would otherwise be required pursuant to this _Section 8_ shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof. 

  

 (g) Except as expressly stated in this _Section 8_, the Series D Preferred Stock will not have any relative, participating, optional or other special voting rights or powers and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action. The holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall have exclusive voting rights on any Charter amendment that would alter only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Charter, of the Series D Preferred Stock. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of any series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue shall not be entitled to vote together as a class with the holders of Series D Preferred Stock on any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Charter unless such action affects the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock equally. 

  

  

 9. _Information Rights_. During any period in which the Corporation is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation will use its best efforts to (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series D Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses appear on the record books of the Corporation and without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, respectively, that the Corporation would have been required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if it were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required); and (ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies of such reports to any holders or prospective holder of Series D Preferred Stock. The Corporation will use its best efforts to mail (or otherwise provide) the information to the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of such information would have been required to be filed with the SEC, if the Corporation were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, based on the dates on which the Corporation would be required to file such periodic reports if it were a "non-accelerated filer" within the meaning of the Exchange Act. 

  

 10. _Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer_. The Series D Preferred Stock shall be subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer set forth in Article VII of the Charter. 

  

 11. _Record Holders_. The Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series D Preferred Stock may deem and treat the record holder of any Series D Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor the transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 

  

 12. _Office or Agency_. For so long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall at all times maintain an office or agency in one of the 48 contiguous States of the United States of America where shares of Series D Preferred Stock may be surrendered for payment (including upon redemption), registration of transfer or exchange. 

        

 _ SECOND:_ The Series D Preferred Stock has been classified and
designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation under the
authority contained in the Charter. These Articles Supplementary have been
approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in the manner and vote
required by law.

  TWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP. 

FORM OF ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY 

7.50% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 

  

 Two Harbors Investment Corp., a Maryland corporation (the " _Corporation_ "), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that: 

  

 FIRST: Under a power contained in Article VI of the charter of the Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), the Board of Directors (the " _Board of Directors_ ") of the Corporation, by duly adopted resolutions classified and designated 8,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Corporation (" _Preferred Stock_ ") as shares of 7.50% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Series E Preferred Stock_"), with the following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, which, upon any restatement of the Charter, shall become part of Article VI of the Charter, with any necessary or appropriate renumbering or relettering of the sections or subsections hereof. 

   

 1. _Designation and Number_. A series of Preferred Stock, classified as the "7.50% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock" is hereby established. The number of authorized shares of the Series E Preferred Stock shall be 8,000,000. 

  

 2. _Maturity_. The Series E Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless (i) the Corporation decides to redeem or otherwise repurchase the Series E Preferred Stock or (ii) the Series E Preferred Stock becomes convertible and is actually converted pursuant to _Section 7_ hereof. The Corporation is not required to set aside funds to redeem the Series E Preferred Stock. 

  

 3. _Ranking_. The Series E Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, (i) senior to all classes or series of the common stock of the Corporation, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), and to all other equity securities issued by the Corporation other than equity securities referred to in _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this _Section 3_ ; (ii) on a parity with the Corporation\'s 8.125% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Corporation\'s 7.625% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Corporation\'s 7.25% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Corporation\'s 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, and all other equity securities issued by the Corporation with terms specifically providing that those equity securities rank on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; and (iii) junior to all equity securities issued by the Corporation with terms specifically providing that those equity securities rank senior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities. 

  

 4. _Dividends_. 

  

  

 (a) Holders of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board and declared by the Corporation, out of funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 7.50% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $1.875 per annum per share). Dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock shall accumulate daily and shall be cumulative from, and including, [July 15, 2018](1) and shall be payable for each subsequent quarterly dividend

period, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and
October (each, a " _Dividend Payment Date_ "); provided, that if any Dividend
Payment Date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the dividend which
would otherwise have been payable on that Dividend Payment Date may be paid on
the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if paid on
such Dividend Payment Date and no interest, additional dividends or other sums
will accumulate on the amount so payable for the period from and after
such Dividend Payment Date to such next succeeding Business Day. Any dividend
payable on the Series E Preferred Stock, including dividends payable for any
partial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of
record as they appear in the stock records of the Corporation for the Series
E Preferred Stock at the close of business on the applicable record date,
which shall be the first day of the calendar month, whether or not a Business
Day, in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls (each, a " _Dividend
Record Date_ "). The dividends payable on any Dividend Payment Date shall
include dividends accumulated to, but not including, such Dividend Payment
Date.

  

   

 (b) No dividends on shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at any time when the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to any indebtedness of the Corporation, prohibit the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof or provide that the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof would constitute a breach of the agreement or a default under the agreement, or if the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of those dividends and whether or not those dividends are declared. No interest, or sum in lieu of interest, will be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Stock which may be in arrears, and holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends described in _Section 4(a)_ hereof. Any dividend payment made on the Series E Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock. 

  

 (d) Except as provided in _Section 4(e)_ hereof, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, (i) no dividends (other than in shares of Common Stock or in shares of any series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that rank junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, (ii) no other distribution shall be declared or made upon shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that rank junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, and (iii) any shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock that rank junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation shall not be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Corporation that rank junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation and for transfers made pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Corporation of shares of any class or series of stock pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter to preserve its status as a REIT (as defined in the Charter) for federal income tax purposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange 

  

      

  

offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock and any Preferred Stock that rank on a parity with the Series
E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation.

  

 (e) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series E Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock that rank on a parity as to dividends with the Series E Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series E Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock that rank on a parity as to dividends with the Series E Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series E Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the Series E Preferred Stock and accumulated or accrued dividends per share on such other series of Preferred Stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such Preferred Stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Stock which may be in arrears. 

  

 (f) "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. 

  

 (g) "Set apart for payment" shall be deemed to include, without any action other than the following: the recording by the Corporation in its accounting ledgers of any accounting or bookkeeping entry which indicates, pursuant to an authorization by the Board and a declaration of dividends or other distribution by the Corporation, the allocation of funds to be so paid on any series or class of shares of stock of the Corporation; provided, however, that if any funds for any class or series of stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends are placed in a separate account of the Corporation or delivered to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent, then "set apart for payment" with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock shall mean placing such funds in a separate account or delivering such funds to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent. 

  

  

 5. _Liquidation Preference_. 

  

  

 (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid out of the assets the Corporation has legally available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, a liquidation preference of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that it may issue that ranks junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights. 

   

 (b) In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation that ranks on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and all other such classes or series of capital stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. 

  

      

  

 (c) Holders of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to written notice of any such liquidation no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the payment date. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other entity with or into the Corporation, or the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 

  

 (d) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of stock of the Corporation or otherwise, is permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Corporation\'s total liabilities. 

  

  

 6. _Redemption_. 

  

  

 (a) Optional Redemption Right. The Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\' written notice, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. 

   

 (b) Special Optional Redemption Right. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\' written notice, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 6_ , the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will not have the Change of Control Conversion Right (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the shares called for redemption. 

  

 (c) A "Change of Control" is deemed to occur when, after the effective time of the merger of CYS Investments, Inc., a Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, the following have occurred and are continuing: (i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of capital stock of the Corporation entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of the total voting power of all capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Corporation (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and (ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in _clause (i)_ , neither the Corporation nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing such securities) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), the NYSE Amex Equities (the " _NYSE Amex_ ") or the Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE Amex or Nasdaq. 

  

      

  

 (d) In the event the Corporation elects to redeem Series E Preferred Stock, the notice of redemption will be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of Series E Preferred Stock called for redemption at such holder\'s address as it appears on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates (if any) for the Series E Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on the redemption date; (vi) whether such redemption is being made pursuant to _Section 6(a)_ or _Section 6(b) _ hereof; (vii) if applicable, that such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control and, in that case, a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; and (viii) if such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control, that the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock being so called for redemption will not be able to tender such shares of Series E Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control and that each share of Series E Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is called, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If less than all of the Series E Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of redemption will be required where the Corporation elects to redeem Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VII of the Charter to preserve its REIT status for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 (e) Holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the Series E Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid dividends payable upon the redemption following the surrender. 

   

 (f) If notice of redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock has been given and if the Corporation irrevocably sets apart for payment the funds necessary for redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date (unless the Corporation shall default in providing for the payment of the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any), dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series E Preferred Stock, those shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption. 

   

 (g) If any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the redemption price and accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption may be paid on the next Business Day and no interest, additional dividends or other sums will accumulate on the amount payable for the period from and after that redemption date to that next Business Day. 

  

 (h) If less than all of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares) or by any other equitable method the Corporation shall determine that will not result in the automatic transfer of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock to a trust pursuant to Article VII of the Charter (as to restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares of the Corporation\'s capital stock). 

  

      

  

 (i) Immediately prior to any redemption of Series E Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, unless a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case each holder of Series E Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this _Section 6(j)_ , the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed. 

  

 (j) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or contemporaneously is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series E Preferred Stock (except by exchanging them for its capital stock ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Corporation of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VII of the Charter to preserve its REIT status for federal income tax purposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock. 

  

 (k) Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may purchase shares of Series E Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement. Any shares of Series E Preferred Stock that the Corporation acquires may be retired and re-classified as authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of Preferred Stock. 

  

  

 7. _Conversion Rights_. Shares of Series E Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except as provided in this _Section 7_. 

  

  

 (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series E Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof, in which case such holder will have the right only with respect to shares of Series E Preferred Stock that are not called for redemption) to convert some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder (the " _Change of Control Conversion Right_ ") on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of Series E Preferred Stock (the " _Common Stock Conversion Consideration_ ") equal to the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series E Preferred Stock plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) thereon to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date for the Series E Preferred Stock, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (y) the Common Stock Price (as defined below) (such quotient, the 

  

      

  

" _Conversion Rate_ "); and (ii) [ * ](2) (the " _Share Cap_ "),
subject to adjustments provided in _Section 7(b)_ below.

   

 (b) The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Stock to existing holders of Common Stock), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a " _Share Split_ ") with respect to Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable or deliverable, as applicable, in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right will not exceed the product of the Share Cap times the aggregate number of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Change of Control Conversion Date (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the " _Exchange Cap_ "). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap. 

  

 (c) The "Change of Control Conversion Date" is the date the Series E Preferred Stock is to be converted, which will be a Business Day selected by the Corporation that is neither fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which it provides the notice described in _Section 7(h)_ to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock. 

  

 (d) The "Common Stock Price" is (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per share of Common Stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which Common Stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by Pink OTC Markets Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if Common Stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. 

  

 (e) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Stock is or will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the " _Alternative Form Consideration_ "), a holder of Series E Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Form 

    (2)

 NTD: Share cap to be adjusted to preserve the economics of the Crest preferred. Formula would be: New Share Cap is equal to (A) Share Cap, multiplied by (B) a fraction in which (i) the numerator is equal to the sum of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (y) the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) the TWO stock price as of closing (using the average of the closing sale prices per share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the Closing Date) and (ii) the denominator is the TWO stock price as of closing (using the average of the closing sale prices per share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the Closing Date). 
      

  

Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive
upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to
the effective time of the Change of Control (the " _Alternative Conversion
Consideration_ "; the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the
Alternative Conversion Consideration, whichever shall be applicable to a
Change of Control, is referred to as the " _Conversion Consideration_ ").

  

   

 (f) If the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion Consideration in respect of such Change of Control will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders of a plurality of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an election (if electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be, and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Change of Control. 

  

 (g) No fractional shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock in connection with a Change of Control will be issued. Instead, the Corporation will make a cash payment equal to the value of such fractional shares based upon the Common Stock Price used in determining the Common Stock Conversion Consideration for such Change of Control. 

  

 (h) Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, provided that the Corporation has not exercised its right to redeem all shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof, the Corporation will provide to holders of Series E Preferred Stock a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, which notice shall be delivered to the holders of record of the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock in their addresses as they appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series E Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem all or any shares of Series E Preferred Stock, holders will not be able to convert the shares of Series E Preferred Stock called for redemption and such shares will be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series E Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent, transfer agent and conversion agent for the Series E Preferred Stock; (ix) the procedures that the holders of Series E Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right (including procedures for surrendering shares for conversion through the facilities of a Depositary (as defined below)), including the form of conversion notice to be delivered by such holders as described below; and (x) the last date on which holders of Series E Preferred Stock may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal. 

   

 (i) The Corporation shall also issue a press release containing such notice provided for in _Section 7(h)_ hereof for publication on Dow Jones and Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), and post a notice on its website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first business day following any date on which it provides the notice provided for in _Section 7(h)_ hereof to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock. 

  

      

  

 (j) To exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates (if any) representing the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer (or, in the case of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a Depositary, to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted through the facilities of such Depositary), together with a written conversion notice in the form provided by the Corporation, duly completed, to its transfer agent. The conversion notice must state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of Series E Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Series E Preferred Stock. 

  

 (k) Holders of Series E Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the transfer agent of the Corporation prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal delivered by any holder must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series E Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated Series E Preferred Stock has been surrendered for conversion, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series E Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the holder\'s conversion notice. 

  

 (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Sections 7(j)_ and _(k)_ hereof, if any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") or a similar depositary (each, a " _Depositary_ "), the conversion notice and/or the notice of withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures, if any, of the applicable Depositary. 

  

 (m) Series E Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof, in which case only the shares of Series E Preferred Stock properly surrendered for conversion and not properly withdrawn that are not called for redemption will be converted as aforesaid. If the Corporation elects to redeem shares of Series E Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such shares of Series E Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date the redemption price as provided in S _ection 6_ hereof. 

  

 (n) The Corporation shall deliver all securities, cash and any other property owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered on conversion will be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as of the Change of Control Conversion Date. 

  

 (o) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion Right, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of shares of Series E Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or other property. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series E Preferred Stock, no holder of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such shares of Series E Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of such shares of Common Stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the applicable share transfer and 

  

      

  

ownership limitations contained in Article VII of the Charter, unless the
Corporation provides an exemption from this limitation to such holder pursuant
to Article VII of the Charter.

   

 (p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are the holders of record of shares of Series E Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. Except as provided in this _Section 7(p)_ , the Corporation will make no allowance for unpaid dividends that are not in arrears on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted. 

  

  

 8. _Voting Rights_. 

  

  

 (a) Holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as set forth in this _Section 8_. On each matter on which holders of Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, each share of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote, except that when shares of any other class or series of the Preferred Stock have the right to vote with the Series E Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, the Series E Preferred Stock and the shares of each such other class or series will have one vote for each $25.00 of liquidation preference (excluding accumulated dividends). 

  

 (b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors constituting the Board will be automatically increased by two (if not already increased by two by reason of the election of directors by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and with which the Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to vote as a class with respect to the election of those two directors) and the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a single class with all other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of those two directors, will be entitled to vote for the election of those two additional directors at a special meeting called by the Corporation at the request of the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock or by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of those two directors (unless the request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, in which case, such vote will be held at the earlier of the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation), and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Series E Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment. In that case, the right of holders of the Series E Preferred Stock to elect any directors will cease and, unless there are other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of any directors elected by holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board shall be reduced accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the total number of directors elected by holders of the Series E Preferred Stock (voting as a single class with all other classes or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of such directors) pursuant to the voting rights under this _Section 8_ exceed two. 

  

      

  

 (c) If a special meeting at a place within the United States designated by the Corporation is not called by the Corporation within 30 days after request from the holders of Series E Preferred Stock as described in _Section 8(b)_ hereof, then the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock may designate a holder to call the meeting at the expense of the Corporation and such meeting may be called by the holder so designated upon notice similar to that required for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the place within the United States designated by the holder calling such meeting. The Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses of calling and holding any meeting and of electing directors pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ hereof, including, without limitation, the cost of preparing, reproducing and mailing the notice of such meeting, the cost of renting a room for such meeting to be held, and the cost of collecting and tabulating votes. 

  

 (d) If, at any time when the voting rights conferred upon the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ hereof are exercisable, any vacancy in the office of a director elected pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ shall occur, then such vacancy may be filled only by the remaining such director or by vote of the holders of record of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock and any other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to _Section 8(b)_. Any director elected or appointed pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ may be removed only by the affirmative vote of holders of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock and any other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which classes or series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to _Section 8(b)_, such removal to be effected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock and any such other classes or series of Preferred Stock, and may not be removed by the holders of the Common Stock. 

  

 (e) So long as any shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, voting together as a single class with all series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up or reclassify any of the authorized capital stock of the Corporation into such shares, or create or authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares; or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series E Preferred Stock (each, an " _Event_ "); provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any Event set forth in _clause (ii)_ , so long as the Series E Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that, upon an occurrence of an Event, the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of any such Event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and, provided further, that any increase in the amount of the authorized Common Stock or Preferred Stock, including the Series E Preferred Stock, or the creation or issuance of any additional shares of Series E Preferred Stock or other series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of such series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series E Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers. 

  

      

  

 (f) The voting rights provided for in this _Section 8_ will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which voting by holders of the Series E Preferred Stock would otherwise be required pursuant to this _Section 8_ shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof. 

  

 (g) Except as expressly stated in this _Section 8_ , the Series E Preferred Stock will not have any relative, participating, optional or other special voting rights or powers and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action. The holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall have exclusive voting rights on any Charter amendment that would alter only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Charter, of the Series E Preferred Stock. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of any series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote together as a class with the holders of Series E Preferred Stock on any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Charter unless such action affects the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock equally. 

  

  

 9. _Information Rights_. During any period in which the Corporation is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation will use its best efforts to (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series E Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses appear on the record books of the Corporation and without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, respectively, that the Corporation would have been required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if it were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required); and (ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies of such reports to any holders or prospective holder of Series E Preferred Stock. The Corporation will use its best efforts to mail (or otherwise provide) the information to the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of such information would have been required to be filed with the SEC, if the Corporation were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, based on the dates on which the Corporation would be required to file such periodic reports if it were a "non-accelerated filer" within the meaning of the Exchange Act. 

  

 10. _Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer_. The Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer set forth in Article VII of the Charter. 

  

 11. _Record Holders_. The Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series E Preferred Stock may deem and treat the record holder of any Series E Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor the transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 

   

 12. _Office or Agency_. For so long as any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall at all times maintain an office or agency in one of the 48 contiguous States of the United States of America where shares of Series E Preferred Stock may be surrendered for payment (including upon redemption), registration of transfer or exchange. 

  

 _ SECOND:_ The Series E Preferred Stock has been classified and
designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation under the
authority contained in the Charter. These Articles Supplementary have been
approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in the manner and vote
required by law.

        

 _ THIRD:_ The undersigned acknowledges these Articles
Supplementary to be the corporate act of the Corporation and as to
all matters or facts required to be verified under oath, the undersigned
acknowledges that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, these
matters and facts are true in all material respects and that this statement

EXHIBIT A 

  

       Calculation Principles

  

 All capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") by and among Two Harbors Investment Corp., a Maryland corporation ("Parent"), Eiger Merger Subsidiary LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and CYS Investments, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 

 1.

 Company and Parent investment securities, equity securities, mortgage servicing rights and derivatives shall be valued at market value as of the Determination Date in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the party\'s past practice in the preparation of its audited financial statements.  


2.

 Parent loans held for sale shall be valued at fair value as of the Determination Date in accordance with GAAP and Parent\'s past practice in the preparation of its audited financial statements.  


3.

 Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share shall be calculated to reflect the value of the Company assets held as of the Determination Date set forth on Schedule 3.1(c)(i) based on the valuation determined by a Valuation Firm prior to the Determination Date and the methodology set forth on such schedule.  


4.

 Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share and Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share shall in each case be calculated to reflect the deduction of the respective Company Preferred Stock and Parent Preferred Stock at liquidation preference.  


5.

 Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share and Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share shall in each case be calculated based on the number of shares of respective Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding (excluding any Cancelled Shares), plus any shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock issuable upon the vesting of any Company Restricted Stock and Parent Restricted Stock.  


6.

 Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share shall reflect a reduction for the Company Additional Dividend Amount or any other distributions on shares of Company Common Stock that are declared or are anticipated to be declared for which the record date is or will be prior to the Effective Time.  


7.

 Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share shall reflect a reduction for the Parent Additional Dividend Amount or any other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock that are declared or are anticipated to be declared for which the record date is or will be prior to the Effective Time.  


8.

 Except as set forth in these calculation principles, no further adjustment will be made for expenses previously accrued, paid or otherwise reflected as of the Determination Date in the financial statements used to determine the Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share or the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share, other than to the extent necessary to correct any errors in the application of GAAP.  


9.

 The effect of the conversion or exchange of any outstanding securities that are convertible or exchangeable for Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall be computed using the treasury stock method.  


10.

 If the Company is required after the date of the Agreement, but prior to the Determination Date, to record any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets pursuant to GAAP, then the amount of such impairment will be disregarded from the determination of Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share.   

 

 11.

 The Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share and the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share will exclude any expenses or reserves associated with any Proceeding made or initiated by any holder of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, respectively, including any derivative claims, arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the Transactions, including the Merger.
