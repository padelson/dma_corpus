dollar for dollar, by the total amount of the Working Capital of

above as of the Closing (the " _Preliminary Closing Adjustment Schedule_ "),

personnel as reasonably requested by Seller to prepare the Preliminary
Closing Adjustment Schedule.

Closing Adjustment Schedule, Buyer shall review the Preliminary Closing
Adjustment Schedule. During such time, Buyer shall be permitted to review the
working papers of Seller relating to the Preliminary Closing Adjustment
Schedule and shall have such access to Sellers personnel as may be

are not objected to by Buyer (by written notice to Seller specifying such
items and the reasons therefor in reasonable detail) by the expiration of

shall be deemed conclusive for purposes of the Final Closing Adjustment
Amount (as defined below).

  



  

(v) The Parties shall attempt to resolve any disputed items which Buyer
notified Seller of pursuant to subsection (iv) above (the " _Disputed Items_
") within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice from Buyer. If during such

Buyer shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, cause a mutually agreed upon
arbitrator which may include an accounting firm to promptly review this
Agreement and the remaining Disputed Items for purposes of resolving the
Disputed Items and calculating the Final Closing Adjustment Amount. In making
such calculation, such arbitrator shall make a determination only of Disputed
Items not resolved by the Parties and in the case of all other items shall
use the amounts which are agreed upon by the Parties. Such arbitrator
shall deliver to Seller and Buyer, as promptly as practicable, a report
setting forth its resolution of the remaining Disputed Items and its
calculation of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount, which report shall be
final and binding upon the Parties hereto. The cost of such review and
report shall be borne by the Party against whom the disagreement is in large
part resolved or, if the resolution does not substantially favor
either Party, such costs shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. In all
events, such arbitrator shall determine the assessment of such costs.

  



  

(vi) The amount reflected on the Preliminary Closing Adjustment Schedule
agreed to by the Parties or as calculated by the arbitrator pursuant to
subsection (v) above, as the case may be, shall be the " _Final Closing
Adjustment Amount_ ," which shall be conclusive for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is greater than the
Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller, in
the manner and with interest as provided herein, the amount of the
difference. If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer, in the manner
and with interest as provided herein, the amount of the difference.  Any
payments pursuant to this Section

  



        
   

  



  

2.1(c)(vi) shall be made within two (2) Business Days after the determination
of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and shall be made by causing such
payments to be credited in immediately available funds to the account of
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, as may be designated by the Party
receiving payment.

  



  

(vii) The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to any provision of this
Section 2.1(c) shall bear interest from and including the date of the Closing
but excluding the date of payment, computed on the basis of the average LIBOR
Rate over such period. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as
the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of
a year of 365 days and the actual number of days for which interest is due.

(a) _Schedule 3.13(a) _lists all of the employee benefit plans and programs,
including, without limitation, (i) all retirement, savings and other pension
plans; (ii) all health, severance, insurance, disability and other employee
welfare plans; and (iii) all employment, incentive, vacation and other
similar plans, whether or not subject to ERISA and whether covering one
person or more than one person, that are maintained by Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate with respect to Company Employees (as defined below) or to which
Seller or any ERISA Affiliate contributes on behalf of Company
Employees (hereafter " _Employee Plans_ ").  Except as otherwise indicated
on _Schedule 3.13(a)_, (i) none of the Employee Plans are established or
maintained by the Companies, (ii) the Companies and the Continued Company

(b) All Employee Plans subject to ERISA and the Code comply with ERISA, the
Code and, as applicable, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, the Family and Medical Leave

(c) All Employee Plans contributed to by the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate
intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code have filed for or
received favorable determination letters with respect to such qualified
status from the Internal Revenue Service. The determination letter for each
such Employee Plan remains in effect, and, to Sellers Knowledge, any
amendment made, or event relating to such an Employee Plan subsequent to the
date of such determination letter, has not materially and adversely affected
the qualified status of the Employee Plan.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(d)_, no Employee Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title IV Plan_ ") or Section 412 of the
Code has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived,
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and to
Sellers Knowledge, no condition exists which would be expected to result in
an accumulated funding deficiency as of the last day of the current plan year
of any Title IV Plan or other Employee Plan subject to Section 412 of the
Code. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan,
and no other event or condition has occurred which might constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, any such Title IV Plan.

of Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects to incur
any liability for withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan.

Effect.

 **Section 5.4** ** ****Certain Tax Matters**.

  



  

(a) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein shall be paid by Buyer when due. Buyer shall
file, to the extent required by applicable Tax laws, all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. To
the extent required by applicable Tax laws, Seller or any of its Affiliates
will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation.

  



  

(b) Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Section
5.4(b) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in
prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except for changes required
by changes in applicable Tax laws or changes in fact. Buyer shall not,
and shall not cause or permit the Companies or any of Buyers Affiliates to,
file an amended Tax Return with respect to the Companies for any Tax period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date without obtaining
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in
Sellers sole discretion. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Parties for certain Tax matters
following the Closing Date:

  



  

(i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Companies for all Tax periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date regardless of when they are to be filed. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 5.4 (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, subsection (b)(iii) hereof), Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid on
the Companies behalf, the Taxes attributable to the Companies with respect
to such Tax periods, but only to the extent such Taxes were not included in
the Companies Working Capital as of the Closing, other than Taxes becoming
due as a result of actions taken by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, for
this purpose, actions taken by the Companies on the Closing Date) and
Transfer Taxes, which shall be the responsibility of Buyer. If such Taxes
were included in the Companies Working Capital as of the Closing, the
Companies or Buyer shall pay the amount of such Taxes; if Seller pays such
Taxes on behalf of the Companies, the Companies or Buyer shall reimburse
Seller therefor within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Taxes are
paid.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Companies for Tax periods which begin before or
on the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ").
Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer within fifteen (15) days
after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such Tax periods an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes, which relates to the portion of
such Tax period ending

  



         
  

  



  

immediately prior to the Closing Date, but only to the extent such Taxes were
not included in the Companies Working Capital as of the Closing, other than
Taxes becoming due as a result of actions taken by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, for this purpose, actions taken by the Companies on the Closing
Date) and Transfer Taxes. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending immediately
prior to the Closing Date shall, in the case of any Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real property taxes), be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending immediately prior to the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period. In the case of non-periodic Taxes (i.e., such as Taxes that are
(w) based upon or related to income or receipts, (x) imposed in connection
with any capital or debt restructuring, (y) imposed in connection with any
sale, distribution, or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), or (z) payroll and similar Taxes), the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be determined based on a closing
of the books of the Companies as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) For purposes of Treasury regulation section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)
and (B) (and for purposes of similar provisions under state, local and
foreign Tax law), Seller and Buyer agree that (x) the Companies status as
members of Sellers Affiliated Group shall cease as of the end of the Closing
Date, and the Companies shall become members of Buyers Affiliated Group as
of the beginning of the day immediately following the Closing Date, (y)
except with respect to the sale of the Stock by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement and any items of income, gain, loss or deduction that would be
recognized for Tax purposes by either of the Companies on the Closing Date as
a result of such sale of Stock under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13,
or similar provisions under state, local and foreign Tax law, all
transactions which occur by or with respect to the Companies on the Closing
Date, and all items of income, gain, loss deduction or credit of the
Companies with respect to such transactions, whether resulting from the
assets or operations of the Companies or otherwise, shall for all Tax
purposes be treated as occurring at the beginning of the day immediately
following the Closing Date, and all Taxes resulting from or incurred as a
consequence of any such transactions shall be borne by the Buyer and not the
Seller.  Seller and Buyer agree that (i) the preceding sentence reflects a
"reasonable" method within the meaning of Treasury regulation section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), (ii) Seller and Buyer shall report, and shall cause
each of their Affiliates and all persons related thereto within the meaning
of Section 267(b) of the Code, including, without limitation, each of the
Companies, to report for all Tax purposes all items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit of the Companies, whether resulting from the assets or
operations of the Companies or otherwise, and whether in the ordinary course
of the Companies business or otherwise, in a manner fully consistent
therewith, and (iii) except with respect to

  



        
   

  



  

Tax incurred by Seller upon the sale of the Stock to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement and any items of income, gain, loss or deduction that would
be recognized for Tax purposes by either of the Companies on the Closing Date
as a result of such sale of Stock under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-13, or similar provisions under state, local and foreign Tax law, in
the event Seller or its Affiliate pays Tax with respect to transactions which
occur by or with respect to the Companies on the Closing Date (whether
resulting from the assets or operations of the Companies or otherwise), Buyer
shall reimburse Seller therefor within thirty (30) days after the date on
which the Taxes are paid.

  



  

(iv) Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Closing Date, neither of the
Companies shall incur, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall permit or otherwise allow either of the Companies to incur, any
"extraordinary item" as defined in Treasury regulation section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C).

  



  

(c) Each Party shall provide the other Party with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Governmental Entity,
or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for
Taxes, and each will retain and provide the requesting Party with any records
or information which may be relevant to such return, audit or examination,
proceedings or determination. Any information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.4 or pursuant to any other Section hereof providing for the sharing
of information relating to or review of any Tax Return or other schedule
relating to Taxes shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(d) In the case of any audit, examination, or other proceeding (" _Tax
Proceeding_ ") with respect to (i) any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date and (ii) with respect to any other Tax period ending after the
Closing Date for which Seller is or may be liable for any Taxes pursuant to
this Agreement, Buyer shall inform Seller in writing of such Tax Proceeding
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by Buyer of written notice
thereof. In the event Buyer fails to timely provide Seller with written
notice of such Tax Proceeding, Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer or its
Affiliates hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of any Adverse
Consequences arising as a result of such failure to notify. Buyer
shall afford Seller, at Sellers expense, the opportunity to control the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
have the right, at Buyers expense, to attend and participate in such Tax
Proceeding and give comments, which Seller will reasonably consider.

  



  

(e) To the extent not specifically identified in the Working Capital as of
the Closing, any refund of Taxes paid or payable by or with respect to the
Companies, shall be promptly paid as follows, or to the extent payable but
not paid due to offset against other Taxes shall be promptly paid by the
Party receiving the benefit of the offset as follows: (i) to Seller if
attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, or for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable, determined
in a manner consistent with Section 5.4(b)(ii), to the portion of such Tax
period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date; and (ii) to Buyer if
attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date or for any Straddle Period to the

  



        
   

  



  

extent allocable, determined in a manner consistent with Section
5.4(b)(ii), to the portion of such Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date.

  



  

(f) At Sellers request, Buyer shall file and shall cause each of its
Affiliates, including, without limitation, the Companies, to file a Tax
election under Treasury regulation section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) and section
1.1502-21T(b)(3)(ii)(B), and any similar election for capital loss purposes,
and any similar elections under state, local or foreign tax law.

  



  

(g) None of Buyer, the Companies, or any of their Affiliates shall make any
election under Code Section 338 with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

(h) On the Closing Date, none of the Companies shall take, and none of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates shall permit or otherwise allow either of the
Companies to take, any action not in the ordinary course of the Companies
business, including, but not limited to, the merger or liquidation of either
of the Companies or the distribution of any property in respect of any of the
Companies stock, without the prior written consent of Seller.

  



  

(i) Buyer, Seller and each of the Companies agree that, for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes and similar provisions under state, local and foreign Tax
law, no "minimum tax credit" (as defined in Code Section 53) shall be
allocated to either of the Companies; rather, all such minimum tax credit
shall be retained by Seller and its remaining Affiliated Group.

  



  

(j) All Tax sharing agreements or arrangements that provide for the
allocation, apportionment, sharing, or assignment of Tax liability between
any of the Companies and Seller or Sellers Affiliates shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 5.5** ** ****Conduct of Business of the Companies**.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall cause the Companies
to conduct their businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practices, and use their respective Reasonable Efforts
to preserve their relationships with licensors, suppliers, dealers, customers
and others having business relationships with the Companies. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement, as may be required by applicable law,
regulation or any Governmental Entity, or as set forth on _Schedule 5.5(a)_,

 **Section 5.6** ** ****Notice of Changes**.  Prior to the Closing, each
Party shall promptly advise the other in writing with respect to any matter
arising after execution of this Agreement of which that Party obtains
knowledge and which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement
and not set forth in this Agreement, including any of the Schedules, would

 **Section 5.7** ** ****Employee Matters**.

  



  

(a) " _Company Employees_ " shall mean all those individuals who, as of the
Closing Date are (i) employed by Dominion Peoples or Dominion Hope ("
_Continued Company Employees_ ") or (ii) employed by Dominion Resources
Services, Inc. but who provide services to Dominion Peoples or Dominion Hope
(" _Shared Services Employees_ ") and who accept an offer of employment with

30, 2006, but in any event at least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing, a
list of Shared Services Employees whom Buyer shall have access to and the
opportunity to offer employment. The Shared Services Employees who accept an
offer of employment with Buyer and the Companies, together with the Continued
Company Employees, shall be collectively referred to as " _Company Employees_
".  Individuals who are otherwise Company Employees but who on the
Closing Date are not actively at work due to a leave of absence covered by
the Family and Medical Leave Act, or due to any other authorized leave of
absence, shall nevertheless be treated as Company Employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that an individual shall not be considered a Company Employee, if
such individual as of the Closing Date is receiving benefits under the
Dominion Resources, Inc. Long-Term Disability Plan.

  



  

(b) With respect to Company Employees who are covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement on the Closing Date, the Buyer will cause the Companies
to continue to abide by the terms and conditions of the Collective Bargaining
Agreements, including the Agreement to Participate in the Utility Workers
Union of America National Health and Welfare Fund (the " _UWUA Fund_ "). With
respect to the lump sum contributions to the UWUA Fund as set forth on
Appendix No. 18 to the Agreement between Dominion Transmission, Inc. and Hope
Gas, Inc., DBA Dominion Hope and the Utility Workers Union of America ("
_United Gas Workers  Union_") Local No. 69, Division II AFL-CIO (" _Local 69
II CBA_ "), the obligation for making such contributions for each
respective payment date on and after the Closing Date shall be allocated
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller or Sellers Affiliates, on the
other hand, on the basis of the relative number of employees of each covered
by the Local 69 II CBA (or any successor collective bargaining agreement
thereto) as of the Closing. As of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall assume
the obligation for making the remaining lump sum contributions, if any, to
the UWUA Fund on behalf of Company Employees (and former Company Employees)
covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between The Peoples Natural
Gas Company and United Gas Workers Union Local 69, Division I Utility
Workers Union of America AFL-CIO.

  



  

(c) Buyer acknowledges that during the applicable terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements, on and after the Closing Date, Seller will continue to
be entitled

  



        
   

  



  

to reimbursement from the UWUA Fund for certain costs related to
former employees who were covered by one of the Collective Bargaining
Agreements and are participating in a retiree health plan sponsored by the
Seller or its Affiliates (the " _Retired Union Employees_ "). Buyer shall use
its best efforts and take all action necessary to assist Seller in continuing
to receive reimbursements from the UWUA Fund for costs related to Retired
Union Employees, including if necessary, (i) making reimbursement requests
with the UWUA Fund on behalf of the Seller, and (ii) forwarding to the Seller
any such reimbursements received by Buyer within two (2) Business Days after

(d) Subject to Section 5.7(b) and, with respect to Company Employees who are
not covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement as of the Closing Date for a
period of one year after the Closing, the Buyer shall provide a level of
pension benefits not lower than such level of pension benefits provided to
Company Employees calculated as of the Closing Date using the applicable
pension benefit formula provided in the Dominion Transmission/Hope Gas Union
Pension Plan, The Pension Plan of Peoples Natural Gas Company for Employees
Represented by the United Gas Workers Union Local No. 69, Division 1 or the
Dominion Resources, Inc. Salaried Employees Pension Plan. The Buyers
obligation under the Buyers Plan shall be calculated as the difference of
(A) minus (B), where: (A) equals the total pension benefit of such Company
Employee as calculated as of such Company Employees termination, retirement
or separation from service date ("Retirement Date") with the Buyer using (1)
the pension benefit formula under the Sellers defined benefit pension plan
and applicable to such Company Employee as of the Closing Date, (2) final
average earnings (as defined in Sellers applicable pension plan) as of such
Company Employees Retirement Date with the Buyer, taking into account
compensation earned from Seller and its Affiliates through the Closing Date
and compensation earned from the Buyer and its Affiliates through such
Company Employees Retirement Date with the Buyer, and (3) service credit
earned under the applicable Sellers defined benefit pension plan through the
Closing Date plus service credit earned under the Buyers applicable pension
plan from the Closing Date until such Company Employees Retirement Date with
the Buyer; and (B) equals the frozen, age 65 accrued benefit of each Company
Employee under the applicable Seller defined benefit pension plan as of the
Closing Date as if the Company Employee had terminated employment and
participation in the Seller defined benefit pension plan as of the Closing
Date under the provisions of the Seller defined benefit pension plan in
effect on the Closing Date and after taking into account any subsidies and/or
supplemental benefits accrued as of such Closing Date, actuarially converted
into a benefit payable at the same time and in the same form as the benefit
payable under Buyers Plan. Seller will provide all necessary
earnings history and information required to calculate the benefit under Part
A and B of the formula as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof.

  



  

(e) With respect to Company Employees who are not covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement, Buyer agrees to continue the employment of such
employees for a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date at levels of total compensation (base salary and incentive
opportunities) and benefits, in the aggregate, comparable to the levels of
total compensation (base salary and incentive opportunities) and benefits, in
the aggregate, of each such Company Employee in effect as of the

  



        
   

  



  

Closing Date. If the employment of any Company Employee is terminated, other

provide the terminated Company Employee with the severance benefits at least
as valuable as those set forth on _Schedule 5.7(e)_.

from Parents Benefit Plans provided to similarly situated employees employed
by an entity ceasing to be an ERISA Affiliate of Seller and Seller shall, if
applicable, provide all Company Employees with appropriate notice of such
cessation or participation and accruals in accordance with Section 204(h)
of ERISA and Code Section 4980F (and the related regulations), at
least forty-five (45) days in advance of the Closing Date on and after the
Closing Date, neither Buyer nor the Companies shall have any liability with

eligible to participate in and, if elected, shall commence participation in
the employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
programs, policies, contracts, fringe benefits, or arrangements (whether
written or unwritten) of Buyer or its Affiliates (collectively, "
_Buyer Employee Plans_ "). Buyer shall, to the extent permissible under any
Buyer Employee Plan (provided that Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to
remove any restrictions including restrictions in any insurance policy),
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to Company Employees and their spouses and dependents,
if applicable, under the Buyer Employee Plans, other than, but only to the
extent of, limitations or waiting periods that were in effect with respect to
such employees under the Sellers Employee Plans that have not been satisfied
as of the Closing Date.  Buyer shall, to the extent permissible under any
Buyer Employee Plan (provided that Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to
remove any restrictions under any Buyer Employee Plan or related insurance
policy), provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under Buyers Employee Plans. Buyer shall accept
or cause to be accepted transfers from Sellers medical reimbursement plan
and dependent care assistance plan of each Company Employees unused account
balance as of the Closing Date and credit such employee with such amounts
under the applicable Buyer Employee Plans. In the event the plan years under
Buyers Employee Plans and Sellers Employee Plans do not end on the same
date, such credits and transfers set forth in the preceding sentence shall be
applied under Buyers Employee Plans for the plan year which includes the
Closing Date; provided however that if there are less than six (6) months
remaining in the plan year which includes the Closing Date, such credits and
transfers shall be applied to the plan year which begins next following the
Closing Date.

  



  

(h) Buyer shall cause to be provided to each Company Employee credit for
prior service with Seller or its Affiliates for all purposes (including
vesting, eligibility, benefit accrual and/or level of benefits) in all Buyer
Employee Plans, including fringe

  



        
   

  



  

benefit plans, vacation and sick leave policies, severance plans or policies,

direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such employees distribution from
Sellers defined contribution plan (excluding securities, but including plan
loans).

  



  

(k) As of the Closing, Seller shall take all necessary action to cause the
defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans maintained by the
Seller to fully vest the Company Employees in their account balances and/or
accrued benefits under such plans.

dependent thereof), the Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations
arising under any Seller welfare benefit plans to the extent that such
liability or obligation relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported

 **ARTICLE X 
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

 **Section 10.1** ** ****Indemnification**.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by Seller_.  Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer from any and all Adverse Consequences incurred by Buyer, the
Companies (after the Closing), and their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, consultants and agents (the " _Buyer Protected Parties_
"), as a result of, or with respect to (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty of Seller set forth in this Agreement (provided, that for
purposes of seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article X,
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifiers shall be
disregarded), and (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_.  Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller from any and all Adverse Consequences incurred by Seller, the
Companies (before the Closing), and their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, consultants and agents (the " _Seller Protected
Parties_ "), as a result of, or with respect to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement (provided,
that for purposes of seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article X,
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifiers shall be
disregarded), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained
in this Agreement, and (iii) after the Closing, any liability of the
Companies, including those that may be incurred by the Seller, whether
arising before, on, or after the Closing, except as otherwise specifically
provided for in Sections 5.4(b)(i), 5.4(b)(ii), 5.7(l) and 5.7(n) and subject
to Section 10.1(a).

  



  

 **Section 10.2** ** ****Procedure for Indemnification**. Each claim for
indemnification, including those claims resulting from the assertion of
liability by persons or entities not parties to this Agreement, including
claims by any Governmental Entity for penalties, fines and assessments, must
be made by delivery by the Party to be indemnified (the " _Indemnified Party_
") to the Party responsible for the indemnification obligation (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of written notice containing details reasonably
sufficient to disclose to the Indemnifying Party the nature and scope of the
claim within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Partys knowledge of such
claim.  Any failure in the delivery of such notice shall not affect
the obligations of the Indemnifying Party, except if, and only to the extent
that, the rights and remedies of the Indemnifying Party are prejudiced as a
result of the failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice. In the event
that any legal action, claim or proceeding is brought against an Indemnified
Party for which the Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder, the action shall be defended by the Indemnifying
Party and such defense shall include all appeals or reviews. The Indemnifying
Party shall not make any settlement of any claim without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
If the Indemnified Party withholds its consent unreasonably, the Indemnified
Party

  



        
   

  



  

shall be obligated for any future expenses and excess settlement amounts. The
Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate at its expense in connection with any
such claims including, without limitation, reasonable access to the
Indemnified Partys records and personnel relating to such claim.

  



  

 **Section 10.3** ** ****Limitations on Indemnification**.

  



  

(a) A Party may assert a claim for indemnification under Section 10.1(a)(i)
or Section 10.1(b)(i), as the case may be, only to the extent the Indemnified
Party gives notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration of the applicable time period set forth in Section 10.4.  Any
claim for indemnification not made in accordance with Section 10.2 by a Party
on or prior to the applicable date set forth in Section 10.4 or this Section
10.3(a) (and the other Partys indemnification obligations with respect
thereto) will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X: (i) Seller will
not have any indemnification obligations under Section 10.1(a), (A) for any
individual item where the dollar amount of Adverse Consequences relating
thereto is less than $500,000 and (B) in respect of each individual item
where the dollar amount of Adverse Consequences relating thereto is equal to
or greater than $500,000, unless the aggregate dollar amount of all such
Adverse Consequences exceeds Fourteen Million ($14,000,000), and then only to
the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will the aggregate
indemnification to be paid by Seller under Section 10.1(a) exceed One Hundred
Million ($100,000,000).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the limitations
set forth in Section 10.3(b)(i) will not apply to claims asserted by Buyer
for breaches of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a), 3.5 and 3.11, (y) the
limitations set forth in Section 10.3(b)(i) and 10.3(b)(ii) will not apply to
claims asserted by Buyer for retained liabilities of Seller set forth in
Sections 5.4(b)(i), 5.4(b)(ii), 5.7(l) and 5.7(n), and (z) the limitations
set forth in Section 10.3(b)(i) and 10.3(b)(ii) will not apply to claims
asserted by Buyer arising from the intentional fraud and willful misconduct
of Seller.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X: (i) Buyer will not
have any indemnification obligations under Sections 10.1(b)(i) or (ii), (A)
for any individual item where the dollar amount of Adverse Consequences
relating thereto is less than $500,000 and (B) in respect of each individual
item where the dollar amount of Adverse Consequences relating thereto is
equal to or greater than $500,000, unless the aggregate dollar amount of all
such Adverse Consequences exceeds Fourteen Million ($14,000,000), and then
only to the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will the aggregate
indemnification to be paid by Buyer under Sections 10.1(b)(i) and 10.1(b)(ii)

claims asserted by Seller for breaches of Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3(a) and 4.5,
and (y) the limitations set forth in Sections 10.3(c)(i) and 10.3(c)(ii)

the Parties contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will
expire six (6) months after the Closing Date,

  



        
   

  



  

except that (i) the representations and warranties in Sections 3.8, 3.13,
3.14 and 3.16 of this Agreement will survive the Closing and will expire one
(1) year after the Closing Date, and (ii) the representations and warranties
in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a), 3.11, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3(a) and 4.5 of
this Agreement will survive the Closing and will expire upon the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations. The expiration of the
representation and warranty contained in Section 3.8 shall not affect the
survival of Section 5.4.

  



  

 **Section 10.5** ** ****Exclusivity**.  Except for intentional fraud and
willful misconduct, the rights and remedies of Seller and the Seller
Protected Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Protected
Parties, on the other hand, for monetary damages under this Article X are,
solely as between Seller and the Seller Protected Parties on the one hand,
and Buyer and the Buyer Protected Parties on the other hand, exclusive and in
lieu of any and all other rights and remedies for monetary damages which each
of Seller and the Seller Protected Parties on the one hand, and Buyer and the
Buyer Protected Parties on the other hand, may have under this Agreement or
under applicable laws with respect to any indemnifiable claim, whether at
common law or in equity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may bring an
action to enforce this Article X.

  



  

 **Section 10.6** ** ****Mitigation and Limitation of Claims**.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

  



  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate all
losses, damages and the like relating to an indemnifiable claim, including
availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, and
other rights at law or equity, and shall provide such evidence and
documentation of the nature and extent of such claim as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnified Partys reasonable steps
shall include the reasonable expenditure of money to mitigate or otherwise
reduce or eliminate any loss or expense for which indemnification would
otherwise be due under this Article X; and

  



  

(b) An Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations under this Article X
shall be reduced to the extent that the subject matter of the claim is
covered by and paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant to (i) a warranty or
indemnification from a third party, or (ii) insurance.

  



  

 **Section 10.7** ** ****Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments**. Seller and
Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article X as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign Tax
purposes.

  



  

 **Section 10.8** ** ****Tax Benefit**. Any payment made by any
Indemnifying Party hereunder shall be reduced (but not below zero) to take
into account the net present value of any Tax benefit that may be realized by
the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence of an Adverse Consequence.
The amount of any such Tax benefit shall be determined at (a) the maximum
statutory rate then in effect for applicable federal and/or local country
Taxes, and (b) for state and local Taxes (if applicable), at the combined
state and local rate of ten percent (10%), which will be Tax effected at such
maximum federal rate.
