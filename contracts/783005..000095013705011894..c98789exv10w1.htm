 1.3. _Shared Assets_. 

  

 (a) Some of the Station Contracts may be used in the operation of multiple stations or other business units (the "Shared Contracts") and are identified as such on _Schedule 1.1(d)_. The rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts, except for those Shared Contracts already allocated on Schedule 1.3, shall be equitably allocated among stations in a manner reasonably determined by Seller, in good faith, in accordance with the following equitable allocation principles: 

   

 (i) any allocation set forth in the Shared Contract shall control; 

  

 (ii) if none, then any allocation previously made by Seller as reflected in Sellers financial statements in the ordinary course of Station operations shall control; 

  

 (iii) if none, then the quantifiable proportionate benefit to be received by the parties after Closing shall control; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iv) if not quantifiable, then reasonable accommodation shall control. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall cooperate with Seller (and any third party designated by Seller) in such allocation, and the Station Contracts (and Assumed Obligations (defined below)) will include only Buyers allocated portion of the rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts (without need for further action and whether such allocation occurs before or after Closing). If designated by Seller, such allocation will occur by termination of the Shared Contract and execution of new contracts. Buyers allocated portion of the Shared Contracts will not include any group discounts or similar benefits specific to Seller or its affiliates. Completion of documentation of any such allocation is not a condition to Closing. 

   

 (c) Seller operates KHON (Honolulu) and KGMB (Honolulu) on a combined basis, and shared assets shall be allocated as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_, and to the extent not allocated to Buyer pursuant to such Schedule, such assets shall be Excluded Assets. If any other Schedule attached hereto includes any items that are shared but not allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Schedule 1.3_, then such items are nonetheless Excluded Assets. If applicable, at Closing, the parties shall enter into the agreements set forth on _Schedule 1.3_, which may include (if applicable) shared services agreements and shared facilities agreements, in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.3 _(or, where appropriate, the parties shall execute an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to such agreements). 

   

 1.4. _Assumption of Obligations_. On the Closing Date (defined below), Buyer shall assume (i) the obligations of Seller arising during, or attributable to, any period of time on or after the Closing Date under the Station Contracts and the FCC Licenses, (ii) the obligations described in Section 5.7 as being the responsibility of Buyer, and (iii) all liabilities included in Working Capital (collectively, the "Assumed Obligations"). Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer does not assume, and will not be deemed by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to have assumed, any other liabilities or obligations of Seller or any of its affiliates (the "Retained Obligations"). 

  

 1.5. _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price to be paid for the Station Assets under this Agreement and the Stock under the SPA shall be an amount equal to Two Hundred Fifty-Nine Million Dollars ($259,000,000) _plus_ the Contingent Payment (as defined on _Schedule 1.5_), if any (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing as follows: (i) $253,000,000 (as allocated) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (ii) the balance by execution and delivery of a secured limited recourse promissory note with the terms described on  _Schedule 1.5 _hereto (the "Loan"). Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price between this Agreement and the SPA. 

  

 1.6. _Working Capital_. As used herein, the term "Working Capital" shall mean (i) all current assets of the Stations, other than Excluded Assets, and (ii) all current liabilities of the Stations that have been incurred in the ordinary course of business, other than intercompany payables and Taxes on or measured by income, in each case to the extent that the same would appear on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), on a basis consistent with the manner in which the balance sheets of the Stations have been prepared previously, as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of Closing (the "Effective Time"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.7. _Allocation_. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate the allocation of the Purchase Price (which for the purposes of this Section 1.7 only shall include all other costs that are capitalized for United States federal income tax purposes) among the Station Assets (including goodwill) for tax purposes within 90 days after the Closing. If Buyer and Seller do not reach an agreement concerning the allocation of the Purchase Price within such time (or, if earlier, prior to any applicable filing deadline), then Buyer and Seller each may file their respective tax returns reflecting the allocation determined by it in accordance with requirements of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 

  

 1.8. _Closing_. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the Station Assets provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the fifth business day after the date of the FCC Consent pursuant to the FCCs initial order, unless such consent is granted between January 23, 2006 and January 30, 2006, in which event the Closing shall take place on January 31, 2006 (or on such other day after such consent as otherwise provided herein or as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth herein. The date on which the Closing is to occur is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." 

  

 1.9. _Governmental Consents_. 

  

 (a) Within five (5) business days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall file an application with the FCC (the "FCC Application") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Buyer. FCC consent to the assignment to Buyer of the main station FCC Licenses and any other FCC Licenses necessary to operate the Stations in the ordinary course of business in all material respects is referred to herein as the "FCC Consent." Buyer and Seller shall diligently prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as soon as possible. 

   

 (b) If applicable, within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for additional information or documentation. Expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as "HSR Clearance." 

   

 (c) Buyer and Seller shall notify each other of all documents filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall furnish each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any governmental filing hereunder. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are referred to herein collectively as the "Governmental Consents." 

   

 1.10. _Renewal_. The main station FCC Licenses expire on the dates set forth on  _Schedule 1.1(a)_. If due prior to Closing and if not previously filed, then Seller shall timely file FCC renewal applications with respect to the Stations and thereafter prosecute such applications. 

   ##### 

  

 

The parties acknowledge that under current FCC policy, either the FCC will not
grant an assignment application while a renewal application is pending, or
the FCC will grant an assignment application with a renewal condition. If the
FCC Application is granted subject to a renewal condition, then the term "FCC
Consent" shall mean FCC consent to the FCC Application and satisfaction of
such renewal condition.

Buyer knows of no reason why it should not be found to be legally, financially and otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, acquire, own and operate the Stations under the Communications Act and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, and knows of no facts that would, under existing law and the existing rules, regulations, policies and procedures of the FCC, disqualify Buyer as an assignee of the FCC Licenses or as the owner and operator of the Stations. No waiver of or exemption from any FCC rule or policy on the part of Buyer is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained. There are no matters relating to Buyer that might reasonably be expected to result in the FCCs denial or delay of approval of the FCC Application. 

  

ARTICLE 4: _SELLER COVENANTS_

    #####

ARTICLE 5: _JOINT COVENANTS_  

   

 Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

  

 5.1. _Confidentiality_. Seller (or The Blackstone Group, LLC on behalf of Seller) and Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer on behalf of Buyer) are parties to a non-disclosure agreement with respect to Seller and its television stations (the "NDA"). To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Seller and Buyer hereby assume the NDA and agree to be bound by the provisions thereof. Without limiting the terms of the NDA, subject to the requirements of applicable law, all non-public information regarding the parties and their business and properties that is disclosed in connection with the negotiation, preparation or performance of this Agreement (including without limitation all financial information provided by Seller to Buyer) shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other person or entity, except in accordance with the terms of the NDA. 

  

 5.2. _Announcements_. Prior to Closing, no party shall, without the prior written consent of the other, issue any press release or make any other public announcement concerning 

   ##### 

  

    

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that
such party is so obligated by law, in which case such party shall give
advance notice to the other. 

  

 5.3. _Control_. Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct the operation of the Stations prior to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Act and the FCC rules and regulations, control, supervision and direction of the operation of the Stations prior to Closing shall remain the responsibility of Seller as the holder of the FCC Licenses. 

  

 5.4. _Risk of Loss_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall bear the risk of any loss of or damage to any of the Station Assets at all times until the Effective Time, and Buyer shall bear the risk of any such loss or damage thereafter. 

   

 (b) If prior to the Effective Time any item of Tangible Personal Property is damaged or destroyed or otherwise not in the condition described in Section 2.6 in any material respect, then: 

   

 (i) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to repair or replace such item in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, and 

  

 (ii) if such repair or replacement is not completed prior to Closing, then the parties shall proceed to Closing, Sellers representations and warranties as of the Closing shall be modified to take into account any such condition and Seller shall promptly repair or replace such item in all material respects after Closing (and Buyer will provide Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with respect to such obligation). 

  

 (c) If a Station is off the air prior to Closing, then Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to return the Station to the air as promptly as practicable in the ordinary course of business. If on the day otherwise scheduled for Closing a Station is off the air, then Closing shall be postponed until the date five (5) business days after the Station returns to the air, unless such Station returns to the air between January 23, 2006 and January 30, 2006, in which event the Closing shall be postponed until January 31, 2006, subject to Section 10.1 and to the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth herein. 

   

 5.5. _Environmental_. 

  

 (a) Seller has provided Buyer with copies of Phase I environmental assessments of certain Real Property sites as shown on _Schedule 1.1(c)_, if any (each a "Phase I"). 

   

 (b) Such assessments identified the items set forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_. With respect to such items: 

   

 (i) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to remediate such items in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, 

  

 (ii) if such remediation is not completed prior to Closing, then the parties shall proceed to Closing and Sellers representations and warranties as of the Closing shall be modified to take into account any such items, and Seller shall promptly remediate such items in 

   ##### 

  

 

all material respects after Closing (and Buyer will provide Seller access and
any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with respect to such
obligation). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the reasonably estimated cost to remedy such items (and any items under the SPA) in the aggregate exceeds the amount set forth in _Schedule 1.1(c)_, then Seller may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Buyer. 

   

 5.6 _Consents_. 

  

 (a) The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) any third party consents necessary for the assignment of any Station Contract or for the execution of the Tower Space Licenses attached to _Exhibit 1.3 _for Mt. Haleakala and Mt. Mauna Loa (which shall not require any payment to any such third party), and (ii) reasonable estoppel certificates from lessors under any Real Property Leases requiring consent to assignment (if any), but no such third party consents or estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except for the Required Consents (defined below). Receipt of consent to assign to Buyer the Stations network affiliation agreements designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(d) _without any material adverse conditions and the Stations leases designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(c) _(if any) is a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to close under this Agreement (the "Required Consents"). 

   

 (b) To the extent that any Station Contract may not be assigned without the consent of any third party, and such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement and any assignment executed pursuant to this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment of such Station Contract; provided, however, with respect to each such Station Contract, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to the extent feasible in effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement under which Buyer shall receive the benefits under the Station Contract from and after Closing, and to the extent of the benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform Sellers obligations arising under the Station Contract from and after Closing in accordance with its terms. 

   

 5.7. _Employees_. 

  

 (a) For a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit for employment, induce or attempt to induce to leave Sellers or an affiliate of Sellers employ, or hire, any employees of Seller or its affiliates staffed in Sellers Indianapolis headquarters or at any other television station owned by Seller or its affiliates (other than general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees). 

   

 (b) If the Stations include any stations identified in Section 1.3(c), then any shared employees shall be allocated as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_. With respect to such shared employees, the terms of this Section 5.7, including Buyers right to selectively offer employment pursuant to Section 5.7(c), shall apply only to those who are allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Schedule 1.3_, and Buyer shall not solicit for hire those who are not allocated to Buyer (other than general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Seller has provided Buyer a list showing employee positions and annualized pay rates and target bonus opportunities, where applicable, for employees of the Stations. Seller shall update that list no later than five (5) business days prior to Closing, and shall provide Buyer with such other information in Sellers possession as Buyer may reasonably request in order to decide to whom it will offer employment, in each case subject to any restrictions under applicable laws. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall identify and provide to Seller a written list of the employees of the Stations to whom Buyer plans to offer employment effective as of the Closing. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one-another in connection with Buyers efforts to hire such employees. Each such offer of employment shall be made upon substantially the same terms and conditions and with substantially the same duties as in effect immediately preceding the Closing, including but not limited to wages, salaries, commission rate (if applicable) and target bonuses (all determined on a cash basis before taking into account Sellers stock compensation program) and with benefits which are substantially similar to the benefits available to similarly situated employees in the markets in which the Stations operate. Any person so hired by Buyer is referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." If any Transferred Employee is subject to a written employment agreement, Buyer shall assume Sellers obligations under such agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.7 is intended to or shall require Buyer to employ or continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any period of time following the Closing or to continue to maintain any term or condition of employment or otherwise to treat any such employee on any basis other than as an employee-at-will (subject to the terms of any employment contract assumed by Buyer). With respect to the Transferred Employees, at Closing employment with Seller shall terminate and employment with Buyer shall commence. Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-half of all applicable severance and other liabilities under Sellers severance policy as in effect on the date hereof (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer) and any other amounts (regardless of whether denominated as severance) owing in connection with the termination of any written employment agreement owing to any employees of the Stations who do not become Transferred Employees or who become Transferred Employees but who are terminated during the first four (4) months following Closing (collectively, "Severance"), provided, however, that Sellers liability with respect to Severance shall not exceed $1 million in the aggregate (including amounts paid by an affiliate of Seller under the SPA) and Buyer shall be liable for all other Severance. 

   

 (d) Buyer shall grant credit to each Transferred Employee for all unused vacation accrued as of the Effective Time as an employee of Seller, and Buyer shall assume and discharge Sellers obligation to provide such leave to such employees (such obligations being a part of the Assumed Obligations). 

   

 (e) Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees (and their spouses and dependents) to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" (including without limitation health insurance plans) and "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA, respectively), with coverage effective immediately upon Closing (and without exclusion from coverage on account of any pre-existing condition unless Buyer determines in good faith that obtaining such coverage without such exclusion is not practicable because of a material increase in cost), with service with Seller deemed service with the Buyer for purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods and differential benefits based on length of service, and with credit under any welfare benefit plan for any deductibles or co-payments paid for the current plan year under any plan maintained by Seller. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) Buyer shall also permit each Transferred Employee who participates in the Sellers 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account balances into the Buyers 401(k) plan as of Closing (or as soon as practicable thereafter when Buyers 401(k) plan is capable of accepting such rollovers), including the direct rollover of any outstanding loan balances such that they will continue to make payments under the terms of such loans under the Buyers 401(k) plan, subject to compliance with applicable law and subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyers 401(k) plan. 

   

 5.8. _Accounting Services_. During the first fifteen (15) business days after Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller at no additional cost the services of the Stations business offices, together with reasonable access to related systems and records, for the purposes of closing the books of the Stations for the period prior to Closing and of facilitating the distribution of any stock compensation from Seller to the Stations employees, all in accordance with the procedures and practices applied by the business offices for periods prior to Closing. 

  

 5.9. _1031 Exchange_. To facilitate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, Seller may assign its rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a "qualified intermediary" under section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the treasury regulations (but such assignment shall not relieve Seller of any of its obligations under this Agreement) and any such qualified intermediary may re-assign to Seller. If Seller gives notice of such assignment, Buyer shall provide Seller with a written acknowledgment of such notice prior to Closing and pay the Purchase Price (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at Closing. 

  

 5.10. _Asset Transfers_. Between the date hereof and Closing, Seller shall and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents who own any of the Station Assets or have rights thereto that should be terminated as of Closing to, (i) transfer to Seller (if prior to Closing) or to Buyer (if at Closing) and (ii) to the extent appropriate, terminate as of Closing, all of their respective rights, title and interest in, to and under such Station Assets. Seller shall and shall cause its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents to prepare, execute and file such documents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and take such other actions as may be required to evidence or record any such transfers or terminations. 

  

 5.11. _Intellectual Property License_. If there is any shared Intellectual Property that is allocated to KHON or KGMB pursuant to Section 1.3, and if requested by a party, then, to the extent of the granting partys rights in such Intellectual Property, the parties shall enter into a customary license agreement to provide a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use such Intellectual Property in the operation of KHON or KGMB, as appropriate, in the ordinary course of business, transferable to any transferee of the Station. Other than any trademarks, service marks, brand names, domain names or trade, corporate or business names of Seller or its affiliates (other than the Stations), Seller for itself and its affiliates (other than the Stations) hereby grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-free license to use any Intellectual Property owned by Seller or an affiliate (other than the Stations) and used by both the Stations and Sellers other stations and business units prior to Closing in the operation of the Stations in the ordinary course of business, provided that such license: (i) may not be assigned by Buyer, except to any successor licensee of the relevant Station, (ii) is limited to the extent of Sellers rights therein, if any, (iii) may be used by Buyer only in the market of the 

   ##### 

  

    

relevant Station and only in a manner that does not violate law or any third-
party rights, and (iv) shall terminate for noncompliance or non-use. 

  

 5.12. _Use of Business Names_. 

  

 (a) To the extent the trademarks, service marks, brand names, domain names or trade, corporate or business names of Seller or its affiliates (other than the Stations) are used by the Stations on stationery, signage, invoices, receipts, forms, packaging, advertising and promotional materials, product, training and service literature and materials, computer programs or like materials ("Marked Materials"), Buyer may continue such pre-existing use for a period of up to three months after Closing, or until the supply of such Marked Materials is exhausted, if sooner. Buyer shall be solely responsible for such use, which: (i) may not be assigned by Buyer, (ii) is limited to the extent of Sellers rights therein, if any, (iii) may be used by Buyer only in a manner that does not violate law or any third-party rights, and (iv) shall terminate for noncompliance or non-use. 

   

 (b) To the extent the trademarks, service marks, brand names, domain names or trade or business names of KHON are used in the operation of television station KGMB on stationery, signage, invoices, receipts, forms, packaging, advertising and promotional materials, product, training and service literature and materials, computer programs or like materials ("KHON Marked Materials"), Seller may continue such pre-existing use for a period of up to three months after Closing, or until the supply of such KHON Marked Materials is exhausted, if sooner. Seller shall be solely responsible for such use, which: (i) may not be assigned by Seller except to a subsequent purchaser of KGMB, (ii) is limited to the extent of Buyers rights therein, if any, (iii) may be used by Seller only in a manner that does not violate law or any third-party rights, and (iv) shall terminate for noncompliance or non-use. 

   

 5.13. _Reasonable Efforts_. Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by January 31, 2006.

foregoing, if the date otherwise scheduled for Closing is between January 23,
2006 and January 30, 2006, Closing shall be January 31, 2006. 

  

 10.3. _Survival_. Neither party may terminate under Sections 10.1(b) or (c) if it is then in material default under this Agreement. The termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party of any liability for breach or default under this Agreement prior to the date of termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Sections 5.1 (Confidentiality), 10.5 (Liquidated Damages) and 11.1 (Expenses) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 10.4. _Specific Performance_. In the event of failure or threatened failure by either party to comply with the terms of this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining such failure or threatened failure and, subject to obtaining any necessary FCC consent, to enforcement of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance requiring compliance with this Agreement. 

  

 10.5. _Liquidated Damages_. If Seller terminates this Agreement or the SPA pursuant to Section 10.1(c) hereof or thereof, then Buyer shall pay Seller on demand an amount equal to 10% of the Purchase Price under this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages and the sole remedy of Seller under this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers recovery of such amount shall constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that Sellers liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Buyers material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder. 

  

ARTICLE 11: _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 11.1. _Expenses_. Each party shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. All governmental fees and charges applicable to any requests for Governmental Consents shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller, except that if more than one HSR Act filing is necessary because a party has more than one ultimate parent entity, then such party shall pay the HSR Act filing fees for any additional filings. Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for one-half of all governmental recording, sales, use and other similar transfer taxes, fees and charges (not including any Taxes on or measured by income) applicable to the transfer of the Station Assets under this Agreement. Each party is responsible for any commission, brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar payment that arises as a result of any agreement or action of it or any party acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 11.2. _Further Assurances_. Before Closing, each party shall perform its obligations and observe the conditions set forth in _Schedule 11.2 _to this Agreement. After Closing, each party shall from time to time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other, execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 11.3. _Assignment_. Except as provided by Section 5.9 (1031 Exchange), neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, provided, however, that Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to an affiliate of Buyer upon written notice to, but without consent of, Seller, provided that (i) any such assignment does not delay processing of the FCC Application, grant of the FCC Consent or Closing, (ii) any such assignee delivers to Seller a written assumption of this Agreement, and (iii) Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties respective successors and any permitted assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. 

  

 11.4. _Notices_. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered on the date of personal delivery or confirmed facsimile transmission or confirmed delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, and shall be addressed as follows (or to such other address as any party may request by written notice):

 11.5. _Amendments_. No amendment or waiver of compliance with any provision hereof or consent pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment, waiver, or consent is sought. 

  

 11.6. _Entire Agreement_. The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated into this Agreement. This Agreement, together with any other agreement executed on the date hereof in connection herewith, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof, except the NDA, which shall remain in full force and effect. No party makes any representation or warranty with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (or in any other agreement executed on the date hereof in connection herewith). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller makes no representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to any projections, budgets or other estimates of the Stations revenues, expenses or results of operations, or, except as expressly set forth in Article 2, any other financial or other information made available to Buyer with respect to the Stations. 

  

 11.7. _Severability_. If any court or governmental authority holds any provision in this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, so long as no party is deprived of the benefits of this Agreement in any material respect, this Agreement shall be construed with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision deleted and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. 

  

 11.8. _No Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to give any rights to any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 11.9. _Governing Law_. The construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof. 

  

 11.10. _Neutral Construction_. Buyer and Seller agree that this Agreement was negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are the product of the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by Buyer and Seller, and the provisions hereof should not be construed against a party on the grounds that the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision. 

  

 11.11. _Cooperation_. After Closing, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any action which is pending or threatened against Seller or its affiliates with respect to the Stations, whether or not any party has notified the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without limiting the generality of the 

   ##### 

  

    

foregoing, Buyer shall make available its employees to give depositions or
testimony and shall furnish all documentary or other evidence that Seller may
reasonably request. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance
of its obligations under this Section 11.11. 

  

 11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 11.13. _Interpretation_. Article titles and headings herein are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Schedules hereto shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth verbatim herein. When used in this Agreement, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, (i) words such as "herein," "hereto," "hereunder," and "hereafter" shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, (ii) the term "including" shall not be limiting, and (iii) the term "ordinary course" shall refer to the ordinary course of Sellers business and the operation of the Stations.
