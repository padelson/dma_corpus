from time to time, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Proxy Statement/Prospectus</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and Parent will prepare (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) and will cause Holdco to file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-4 in connection with the Holdco Stock Issuance (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the

Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Each of Holdco, Parent and the Company shall
(i)&nbsp;use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form&nbsp;S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments of the SEC in accordance with the terms hereof), and prior to the effective date of the Form&nbsp;S-4 and

information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form&nbsp;S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Subject in each case to Section&nbsp;5.02, the Company Board shall make the Company Recommendation to the Company's stockholders and the Company shall include such recommendation in the Proxy

any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto that discovers such information shall promptly

may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form&nbsp;S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Each party hereto and its respective counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses </FONT></P>
