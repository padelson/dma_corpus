 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock; Treatment of Stock Owned by Company Subsidiaries._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of Parent, Holdco, Parent Merger Sub, Company Merger Sub, the Company or holders of Company Shares or Parent Shares or any shares of Holdco Common Stock or capital stock of Parent Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub: 

    

 (i) All Company Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Parent Share that is owned by Parent as a treasury share shall be converted into one share of Holdco Common Stock, to be owned by Holdco as a treasury share immediately following the Effective Time.

the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash

 (e) _ Conversion of Parent Shares._ At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, Holdco, the Parent Surviving Company or the holders of Parent Shares or shares of Holdco Common Stock or the capital stock of the Parent Surviving Company, each Parent Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Parent Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted into one share of Holdco Common Stock (the " _Parent Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Company Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") as specified in Section 251(g) of the DGCL. All matters pertaining to the conversion of outstanding capital stock, and associated rights, of Parent into capital stock and associated rights of Holdco in the Parent Merger shall be governed by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and Section 251(g) and other applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 Section 2.02. _ Proration_.  Notwithstanding Section 2.01(c): 

  

  

 (a) If the product of the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares and the Exchange Ratio (such product being the " _Elected Stock Consideration_ ") is greater than the Maximum Stock Amount (such difference being the " _Excess Amount_ "), then: 

    

 (i) all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and 

  

 (ii) a portion of the Stock Election Shares (if any) of each holder of Company Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Excess Amount and the denominator of which is the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares by the Exchange Ratio, with the remaining portion of such holder\'s Stock Election Shares (if any) being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

    

 (b) If the Elected Stock Consideration is less than or equal to the Maximum Stock Amount, then: 

    

 (i) all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and 

  

 (ii) all Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   

  

    
 Section 2.03. _ Elections_.  Each holder of record of Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election Deadline shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE II, to submit a Stock Election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures. 

  

  

 (a) Concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (the " _Mailing Date_ "), the Company shall cause an election form in such form as Parent shall specify and that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Election Form_ ") (and which shall comply with Section 2.03(b)) to be mailed to record holders of Company Shares as of the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders of Company Shares during the period following the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Deadline_ "). 

  

 (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through customary documentation and instructions) of Company Shares to specify the number of such holder\'s Company Shares with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Stock Consideration (such an election with respect to any Company Shares, a " _Stock Election_ "). Each Stock Election shall be subject to Section 2.02. 

   

 (c) Any Stock Election made pursuant to this Section 2.03 will have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent will have actually received a properly completed Election Form, in the case of a Stock Election in respect of any Company Shares represented by a Company Certificate, together with the applicable Company Certificate, by the Election Deadline. None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

   

 (d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. If the Company Stockholders 

  

      

  

Meeting is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall
promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Deadline.

  

 (e) Any Election Form may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the Company Shares subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Election Form by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. If an Election Form is revoked, the Company Shares as to which such Stock Election previously applied shall be No Election Shares unless a contrary Stock Election is subsequently submitted by the holder prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.04. _ Exchange of Shares_.  

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent._ No later than five Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") as agent for the holders of Company Shares in connection with the Company Merger and for the holders of Parent Shares in connection with the Parent Merger, and to receive and hold in trust the Company Merger Consideration to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and the Parent Merger Consideration to which holders of Parent Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(e). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, and made available for issuance with the Exchange Agent the shares of Holdco Common Stock and an amount in cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Company Merger Consideration for the Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Company Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and the aggregate Parent Merger Consideration for the Parent Shares converted into the right to receive the Parent Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(e) (such cash and shares of Holdco Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration to which holders of Company Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(c), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments of the aggregate Cash Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.04(l). 

  

 (b) _ Letter of Transmittal._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Shares that are represented by Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") whose shares are converted into the right to receive the Company Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Company Merger and the conversion of its Company Shares into the right to receive the Company Merger Consideration (and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates (with respect to Company Shares that are represented by Company Certificates) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.04(j)) to the Exchange Agent, shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify, subject to the Company\'s reasonable approval, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions thereto. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Company Shares or the conversion of Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.01(e), in each case held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC\'s customary surrender or conversion procedures, the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II. 

  

      

  

 (c) _ Company Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange._ Upon (i) the surrender of Company Shares represented by a Company Certificate by physical surrender of such Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate, as provided in Section 2.04(j)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions, (ii) the transfer of Company Shares that are Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or (iii) the transfer of Company Shares that are Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, including by delivery of an "agent\'s message", in accordance with DTC\'s customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Holdco Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and (y) the amount, if any, that such holder has the right to receive in cash pursuant to this ARTICLE II, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.04. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Company Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if (1) in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, (2) in the case of Company Shares represented by Company Certificates, the Company Certificates formerly representing such Company Shares are surrendered to the Exchange Agent, and (3) the written instructions, in the case of clause (1), and the Company Certificates, in the case of clause (2) are accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.04(c), each Company Share, and any Company Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Company Merger Consideration that the holders of Company Shares are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share. 

  

 (d) _ Treatment of Unexchanged Shares._ Except as provided in Section 2.04(j), no cash payment with respect to the Company Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share until the surrender of such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share in accordance with this ARTICLE II. 

  

 (e) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares and Parent Shares._ From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares or Parent Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares or Parent Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares or Parent Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Company Certificates, Company Book-Entry Shares or Parent Book-Entry Shares are presented to Holdco, the Parent Surviving Company, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II, subject to satisfaction of the terms, conditions and requirements set forth in Section 2.04(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Surviving Company is obligated to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on Company Shares in accordance with this Agreement prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and the Parent Surviving Company is obligated to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Parent on Parent Shares in accordance with this Agreement prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (f) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco, and any holder of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of its claim for the Company Merger Consideration. 

  

 (g) _ No Liability._ None of the Company, Parent, Holdco, Parent Merger Sub, Company Merger Sub, the Parent Surviving Company, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares or Parent Shares for two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which such portion of the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Holdco. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any stockholder of the Company or Parent to receive the applicable Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein and following any such losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares in the amount of any such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (i) _ Withholding Rights._ Each of Holdco, Company Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub, Parent, the Company and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Parent Shares, Company Shares, Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under Applicable Law with respect to Taxes. Amounts so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

  

 (j) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Company Certificate representing Company Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the applicable Company Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this ARTICLE II had such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate been surrendered. 

  

 (k) _ Dividends on Holdco Common Stock._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in the Holdco Stock Issuance will be paid to the holder of 

  

      

  

any unsurrendered Company Share until such time as the Company Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) is surrendered or the Company Book-
Entry Share is transferred for exchange, in each case as provided in this
Section 2.04. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax
or other Applicable Laws, there will be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the shares of Holdco Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange
therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of any such shares of Holdco Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to
the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Holdco Common
Stock, all shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued in the Holdco Stock
Issuance will be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  

 (l) _ Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Holdco Common Stock shall receive, in lieu of such fractional share, a cash payment, without interest thereon, equal to the product of (A) such fraction and (B) the Closing Parent Stock Price. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.05. _ Shares of Dissenting Holders_.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such Company Shares who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will not be converted into the right to receive the Company Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive in lieu of the Company Merger Consideration payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated automatically as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive solely the Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.05, if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which are received by the Company relating to such holder\'s rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand, and Parent will not commit to make any such payment or enter into any such settlement prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the Company.

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any of the Company Stock Plans, the Company Options and the Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards) will take all actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to give effect to this Section 2.06(a) to provide that immediately prior to the Effective Time the Company Options and

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time 

  

      

  

prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may
(I) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in a situation that is not in
response to a Superior Proposal if the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or
(II) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt or approve such Superior Proposal and
cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company
Board may take the actions described in (x) clause (II) if the Company
terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(f) concurrently with
entering into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pays the Termination
Fee in compliance with Section 8.03(b) and (y) clause (I) or (II) if:

    

 (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of its or the Company Board\'s intention to take such actions at least four Business Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify (x) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of the Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and the identity of, the Person making the Superior Proposal, or (y) in the case of a proposed Adverse Recommendation Change not involving a Superior Proposal, the material circumstances giving rise to the Adverse Recommendation Change (and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments with respect thereto) (it being agreed that neither (x) the delivery of such a notice by the Company nor (y) the public announcement that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has received an Acquisition Proposal, is evaluating such Acquisition Proposal and has delivered such notice shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); 

  

 (ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such four Business Day period to make such adjustments as requested by Parent in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change; and 

  

 (iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 PM New York City time on the fourth Business Day of such four Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect to a proposed Adverse Recommendation Change not based on the receipt of a Superior Proposal, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law not to effect the Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) with respect to the actions described in Section 5.02(d)(II), after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any financial or other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice in accordance with Section 5.02(d)(i) and a new two Business Day period). 

    

 (e) _ Disclosure Obligations._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from issuing a customary "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if the Company Board concludes, after consultation with outside legal 

  

      

  

counsel, that its failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that
any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section
5.02(d).

Subject to the immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 9.09 shall be null and void. 

  

    
 Section 9.10. _ Specific Enforcement. _ Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that a breach by it of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other parties hereto and that no party hereto will have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, it is agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, including in the case of the Company, the right to specific performance and injunctive relief to cause Parent, Holdco, Parent Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub to effect the Closing in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.02 of this Agreement. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and, subject to Section 8.03(e), shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party hereto may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the parties hereto expressly disclaims that it is owed any duties not expressly set forth in this Agreement, and waives and releases any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A 

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT 

  

 THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of January 28, 2018 by and between WestRock Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and the undersigned stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

    
WITNESSETH: 

  

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, Whiskey Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Holdco_ "), Kola Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (" _Company Merger Sub_ "), Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Merger Sub_ "), and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which provides for, among other things, the merger of Company Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger (the " _Company Merger_ ") and pursuant to which all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.01(c) of the Merger Agreement (the " _Company Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS the Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) of that number of Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) set forth below the Stockholder\'s name on the signature page to this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent, Holdco, Company Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder (in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a stockholder of the Company) has agreed to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

 1. _ Certain Definitions._ All capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: 

  

  

 (a) " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof, (ii) the Effective Date and (iii) the date of any amendment to, or waiver or modification of, the Merger Agreement that extends the End Date or reduces the amount or changes the form of the Company Merger Consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement if, in the case of this clause (iii), Stockholder has abstained from voting on or voted against such matter in Stockholder\'s capacity as a director of the Company. 

  

 (b) " _Shares_ " shall mean (i) all equity securities and equity interests of the Company (including Company Shares) owned (beneficially or of record) by the Stockholder as of the date hereof and (ii) all additional equity securities and equity interests of the Company (including Company Shares) of which the Stockholder acquires beneficial or record ownership during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Expiration Date (including by way of bonus issue, share dividend or distribution, sub-division, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange of shares and the like). 

  

 (c) " _Transfer_ " shall mean, with respect to a Share, to, directly or indirectly, (i) sell, pledge, encumber, exchange, assign, grant an option with respect to, transfer, tender or otherwise dispose 

  

      

  

of such Share or any interest in such Share (including by gift, merger or
operation of law), (ii) enter into any Contract providing for the sale of,
pledge of, encumbrance of, exchange of, assignment of, grant of an option
with respect to, transfer, tender of or other disposition of such Share or any
interest therein (including by gift, merger or operation of law) or (iii)
enter into, renew or maintain any put equivalent position (as defined in Rule
16a-1 under the Exchange Act) for the purpose of hedging economic exposure to
such Share, excluding from this clause (iii) any put equivalent position
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

 2. _ Transfer of Shares_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Transfer Restrictions._ During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not Transfer (or cause or permit the Transfer of) any of the Shares or any rights to acquire any equity securities or equity interests of the Company, or enter into any Contract (including any option, put, call or similar arrangement) relating thereto, except with Parent\'s prior written consent and in Parent\'s sole discretion. Any Transfer (or purported Transfer) in breach of this Agreement shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 

  

 (b) _ Involuntary Transfer._ If any involuntary Transfer of any Shares shall occur, the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such Shares subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (c) _ Transfer of Voting Rights._ During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, (i) grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization or consent or execute any written consent in or with respect to any or all of the Shares (other than any written consent executed in accordance with this Agreement), with any such proxy, power-of-attorney, authorization or consent purported to be granted being void _ab initio,_ or (ii) deposit or permit the deposit of any of the Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement, understanding or arrangement or create or permit to exist any lien, adverse claim, charge, security, interest, pledge, option, proxy or any other encumbrance or restriction whatsoever on title, transfer or exercise of any rights of an equityholder with respect to any of the Shares (collectively, " _Encumbrances_ ") except for any such Encumbrances that may be imposed pursuant to this Agreement or any applicable restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act or any state securities law (" _Permitted Encumbrances_ "). 

  

 (d) _ Permitted Transfers._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder may make Transfers of Shares (i) by will, (ii) by operation of Applicable Law, (iii) for estate planning purposes, (iv) for charitable purposes or as charitable gifts or donations, (v) to any of its Affiliates or (vi) to the extent necessary to (A) fund a tax liability arising from the exercise or vesting of any equity incentives in the Company held by Stockholder, including any withholding obligations, (B) effect any net settlement or (C) pay the exercise price in respect, of any such equity incentives, and in each of cases (i)-(v), the Shares shall continue to be bound by this Agreement and each transferee thereof shall agree in a writing reasonably acceptable to Parent to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Stockholder is not an individual, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict any direct or indirect Transfers of any equity interests in the Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to any agreement in accordance with an Election Form, at any time after the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, the Stockholder may Transfer, or enter into any contract with respect to any Transfer of, all or any portion of the Shares and, if as a result of such Transfer, the Stockholder ceases to be the record or beneficial owner of such Shares, the Stockholder shall have no obligations pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Shares. 

  

      

  

 (e) _ Stop Transfer Instructions_. At all times commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Date, in furtherance of this Agreement, the Stockholder hereby authorizes the Company or its counsel to notify the Company\'s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of the Shares), subject to the provisions hereof and _provided that_ any such stop transfer order and notice will immediately be withdrawn and terminated by the Company following the Expiration Date and shall not apply to any Transfer permitted under _Section 2(d)_. 

   

 (f) _ Acquisition of Shares._ In the event that the Stockholder acquires Shares (or any right or interest therein) after the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall promptly deliver to Parent a written notice indicating the number of such Shares (or right or interest therein) acquired or received. 

  

  

 3. _ Agreement to Vote Shares; Support_. 

  

  

 (a) During the term of this Agreement, at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written resolution of the stockholders of Company, the Stockholder (in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a stockholder of the Company) shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to, vote all Shares that are then-owned by such Stockholder and entitled to vote or act by written consent: 

    

 (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and in favor of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; 

   

 (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, in competition with, or would result in a breach of, the Merger Agreement or either of the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any Acquisition Proposal and any Alternative Acquisition Agreement; and 

  

 (iii) against any of the following actions, proposals or agreements (other than those actions that relate to the Mergers and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement): (A) any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, business combination, reorganization or recapitalization of or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) any material change in the capitalization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the corporate structure, certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (E) any action, proposal or agreement that would reasonably be expected to (x) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of the Company under the Merger Agreement or (y) prevent or materially delay or adversely affect the consummation of the Mergers. 

    

 (b) The Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote its Shares (or to direct how its Shares shall be voted) in its sole discretion and without any other limitation on any matters other than those set forth in _Section 3(a)(i)_, _Section 3(a)(ii)_ and _Section 3(a)(iii)_ that are, during the term of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Company\'s stockholders generally, subject to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) In the event that a meeting of the stockholders of the Company is held, the Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record of the Shares on any applicable record date to, be present in person or by proxy at such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum. 

  

      

  

 (d) The Stockholder shall not enter into any commitment, agreement or understanding with any Person to vote or give instructions in any manner inconsistent with the terms of this _Section 3_ or _Section 5_. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Stockholder to, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, vote in favor of or otherwise consent to any amendment to, or waiver or modification of, the Merger Agreement that (i) imposes any material restrictions or additional material conditions on the consummation of the Company Merger or the payment of the Company Merger Consideration or (ii) extends the End Date or reduces the amount or changes the form of the Company Merger Consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement if the Stockholder has abstained from voting on or voted against such matter in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a director of the Company. 

  

  

 4. _ [Intentionally Omitted]_. 

  

 5. _ No Adverse Act._ The Stockholder agrees that prior to any Expiration Date, except as expressly provided or permitted by this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Parent in its sole discretion, directly or indirectly, (a) enter into any Contract, option or other arrangement or understanding (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to any of the Shares or any interest therein or (b) take or permit any other action that would in any way (i) restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of the Stockholder\'s obligations hereunder, (ii) make any representation or warranty of the Stockholder herein untrue or incorrect or (iii) otherwise restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Stockholder hereby agrees not to commence or participate in, and agrees to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent or the Company (a) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin or delay the operation of, any provision of the Merger Agreement (including any claim seeking to enjoin or delay the consummation of either of the Mergers) or (b) alleging a breach of any duty of the Company Board in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the Stockholder from enforcing his, her or its rights under this Agreement. 

  

 6. _ Agreement Not to Exercise Appraisal Rights._ To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Stockholder shall not exercise, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, any statutory rights (including under Section 262 of the DGCL) to demand appraisal of any Shares that may arise in connection with the Mergers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6_ shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a waiver or release by the Stockholder of any claim or cause of action against Parent, Holdco, Company Merger Sub or Parent Merger Sub to the extent arising out of a breach of this Agreement by Parent. 

  

 7. _ Directors and Officers._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Stockholder (or a designee of the Stockholder) who is a director or officer of the Company from acting in such capacity or fulfilling the obligations of such office (including, for the avoidance of doubt, exercising his fiduciary duties), including by voting, in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, in the Stockholder\'s (or its designee\'s) sole discretion on any matter (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to the Stockholder solely in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a stockholder of the Company), including with respect to Section 5.02 of the Merger Agreement. In this regard, the Stockholder shall not be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including with respect to Section 5.02 of the Merger Agreement. 

        

 8. _ No Solicitation_. 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Expiration Date, the Stockholder shall not take any action that would be a breach of Section 5.02 of the Merger Agreement if taken by the Company, ignoring for these purposes Section 5.02(b) of the Merger Agreement. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 8(a)_ above, the Stockholder may, and may permit its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, participate in discussions and negotiations with any Person making an Acquisition Proposal (or its Representatives) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal if (i) the Company is engaging in discussions or negotiations with such Person in accordance with Section 5.02 of the Merger Agreement and (ii) the Stockholder\'s negotiations and discussions are in conjunction with and ancillary to the Company\'s discussions and negotiations. 

  

  

 9. _ Irrevocable Proxy._ Subject to _Section 3(b)_ above, prior to the Expiration Date, solely in the event of a failure by the Stockholder to act in accordance with the Stockholder\'s obligations as to voting pursuant to Section 3(a) no later than the third Business Day prior to any meeting at which the stockholders of the Company will consider and vote on any of the matters described in Section 3(a), the Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent, and any individual designated in writing by Parent, and each of them individually, as the Stockholder\'s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution and including for purposes of Section 212 of the DGCL), for and in the name, place and stead of the Stockholder, to vote the Shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect of the Shares, in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Stockholder\'s execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this _Section 9_ is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of the Stockholder under this Agreement. The Stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and may be revoked only under the circumstances set forth in the last sentence of this _Section 9_. The Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with Applicable Law. The Stockholder shall, upon written request by Parent, as promptly as practicable execute and deliver to Parent a separate written instrument or proxy that embodies the terms of this irrevocable proxy set forth in this _Section 9_ and is otherwise reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proxy and appointment granted hereby shall be automatically revoked, without any action by the Stockholder, upon the Expiration Date and Parent may terminate any proxy granted pursuant to this _Section 9_ at any time at its sole discretion by written notice to the Stockholder. 

   

 10. _ Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder._ The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

  

  

 (a) _ Power; Binding Agreement._ In the event the Stockholder is an individual, the Stockholder has full power and capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform his obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder, and, in the event the Stockholder is an individual and is married and the Shares constitute community property or otherwise require spousal approval in order for this Agreement to be a legally valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder\'s spouse. Assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of equity. In the event the Stockholder is an entity, (i) the Stockholder is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of 

  

      

  

the jurisdiction of its formation, as applicable, (ii) the Stockholder has
all the requisite power and authority necessary to enter into, execute,
deliver and perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the
Stockholder\'s execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been
duly authorized by it and (iv) no other proceedings on the part of
the Stockholder (or its governing body, board of directors, members,
stockholders or trustees, as applicable) are necessary to authorize or adopt
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

 (b) _ No Conflicts; Consents._ None of the execution and delivery by the Stockholder of this Agreement, the performance by the Stockholder of its obligations hereunder or the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby does or would reasonably be expected to conflict with or result in a violation or breach of (i) any Contract to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder may be bound, including any voting agreement or voting trust, except for violations, breaches or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) in any material respect impair or adversely affect the ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially delay or adversely affect the consummation of either of the Mergers, (ii) any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, order, statute, rule, or regulation applicable to the Stockholder or (iii) in the event the Stockholder is an entity, the Stockholder\'s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents). The execution, delivery and performance by the Stockholder of this Agreement, and the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity. 

  

 (c) _ Ownership of Shares._ The Stockholder (i) is the sole record and beneficial owner of the Shares set forth on the signature page of this Agreement, all of which are free and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and (ii) does not own, beneficially or otherwise, any Company Securities other than the Shares set forth on the signature page of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _ Voting Power._ The Stockholder has, and will at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting have, sole voting power, sole power of disposition, sole power to Transfer, sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth herein and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to all of the Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights, subject to applicable federal securities laws and the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) _ No Finder\'s Fees._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, finder, agent or other Person is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial adviser\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Stockholder in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder of the Company. 

  

 (f) _ No Litigation._ There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the Stockholder or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Order to which the Stockholder or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in each case, for those that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) in any material respect impair or adversely affect the ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially delay or adversely affect the consummation of either of the Mergers. 

   

 (g) _ Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Stockholder for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or 

  

      

  

(ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time it is first mailed to
the Stockholder, at the time of any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

  

 11. _ Disclosure._ The Stockholder shall permit Parent to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and, after providing the Stockholder with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon prior to any such publication or disclosure, any press release or other disclosure document that Parent reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable in connection with the Mergers and any transactions related to the Mergers, the Stockholder\'s identity and ownership of Shares and the nature of the Stockholder\'s commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement. The Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make any press release, public announcement or other public communication with respect to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided that_ such consent shall not be required for any disclosure required by Applicable Law ( _provided that_ reasonable notice of any such disclosure will be provided to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable) and nothing herein shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure permitted to be made pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 12. _ No Ownership Interest._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. Except as provided in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder shall be entitled to any dividends or other distributions declared by the Company Board with respect to the Shares having a record date prior to the Expiration Date. 

  

 13. _ Further Assurances._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon request of Parent, the Stockholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to fulfill such Stockholder\'s obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 14. _ Termination._ This Agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this _Section 14_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall relieve either party hereto from liability, or otherwise limit the liability of the Stockholder, for any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by such party prior to such termination. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Stockholder have any personal liability for any damages resulting from a breach of this Agreement other than in connection with an intentional and willful breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder arising out of actions taken by the Stockholder that the Stockholder knew at such time to be in violation hereof. This _Section 14_ and _Section 1_, _Section 7_, and _Section 15_ (as applicable) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 15. _ Miscellaneous_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Validity._ The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. In the event any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith and execute and deliver an amendment to this Agreement in order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent permitted by law, the original intent of the parties hereto with respect to such provision. 

  

      

  

 (b) _ Binding Effect and Assignment._ This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without prior written consent of the other. 

  

 (c) _ Amendments; Waiver._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any other right hereunder. 

  

 (d) _ Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief._ The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent shall be irreparably harmed and that there shall be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of the Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any such violation, Parent shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to Parent at law or in equity. 

  

 (e) _ Notices._ Any notice, request, instruction or other communication under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered by hand or international courier service or by electronic mail, with a copy thereof delivered or sent as provided below:

value $0.0001 per share.

  

 _ FIFTH_: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred upon it by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation
is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the
Corporation.

  

 _ SIXTH_: Subject to the last sentence of Article EIGHTH, the
Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provisions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and this Certificate of Incorporation,
and all rights conferred upon stockholders and directors herein, are granted
subject to this reservation.

  

 _ SEVENTH_: To the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it now exists and as it
may hereafter be amended, no director or officer of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Article EIGHTH shall
eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer (i) for any breach
of the director\'s or officer\'s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to
Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv)

 _ EIGHTH_: The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as
the same may be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom
it shall have power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and
all of the expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by

capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Any
repeal or modification of

        

this Article NINTH shall not adversely affect any right to indemnification of

 _ NINTH_: Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the
Corporation shall so require, the election of directors of the
Corporation need not be by written ballot.

 SECTION 1.06. _ Quorum_.  Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable law, the holders of a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. 

  

    
 SECTION 1.07. _ Adjournments_.  Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to any other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held under these Bylaws by the chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of such person, by any officer entitled to preside at or to 

        

act as Secretary of such meeting, or by the holders of a majority of the
shares of stock present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote,
although less than a quorum. When a meeting is adjourned to another place,
date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the
place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the date of any
adjourned meeting is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting
was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting
shall be given in conformity herewith. At the adjourned meeting, the
corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting.

  

    
 SECTION 1.08. _ Voting and Proxies_.  Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote held of record by such stockholder and a proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless otherwise provided by applicable law or in the Certificate of Incorporation.

No stockholder may authorize more than one proxy for the stockholder\'s shares. Any copy, facsimile transmission or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, _provided_ that such copy, facsimile transmission or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 

  

    
 SECTION 1.09. _ Action at Meeting_.  When a quorum is present at any meeting, any election shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the election, and all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the matter (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, a majority of each such class present or represented and voting affirmatively or negatively on the matter shall decide such matter), except when a different vote is required by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. 

  

 All voting, including on the election of directors, but excepting where otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may be by a voice vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon demand therefor by a stockholder entitled to vote or such stockholder\'s proxy, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballot, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting. Every vote taken by ballot shall be counted by an inspector or inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting. The corporation may, and to the extent required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more persons as an alternate inspector to replace any inspector who fails to act.

Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of such inspector\'s duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector\'s ability. 

  

    
 SECTION 1.10. _ Stockholder Action Without Meeting_.  Any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. All such consents shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation and shall be maintained in the corporate 

        

records. Prompt notice of the taking of a corporate action without a meeting
by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders
who have not consented in writing.

  

 An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder, or by a proxy holder or other person authorized to act for a stockholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purpose of this Section 1.10, _provided_ that such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation can determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or by a person authorized to act for the stockholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or authorized person transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. 

  

    
 SECTION 1.11. _ Meetings by Remote Communication_.  If authorized by the Board of Directors, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in the meeting and be deemed present in person and vote at the meeting, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, _provided_ that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy holder, (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.

 SECTION 2.03. _ Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships_.

expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. No decrease in the
number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term
of any incumbent director.

In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. Interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or at a meeting of a committee which authorizes a particular contract or transaction. 

        

    
 SECTION 2.11. _ Action at Meeting_.

 SECTION 2.12. _ Action by Written Consent_.  Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent to the action in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall he in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. 

  

    
 SECTION 2.13. _ Committees_.

Each such committee shall keep minutes and make such reports as the Board of Directors may from time to time request. Except as the Board of Directors may otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided by such rules, its business shall be conducted as nearly as possible in the same manner as is provided in these Bylaws for the Board of Directors. 

  

    
 SECTION 2.14. _ Compensation of Directors_.

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 

  

    SECTION 7.01. _ Right to Indemnification_.  Each person
who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative ("proceeding"), by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of
another corporation, or as a controlling person of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended against all expenses, liability and
loss reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith
and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of such person\'s
heirs, executors and administrators: _provided_ , _however_ , that except as
provided in Section 7.2, the corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnity in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if (a) such indemnification is expressly required to be
made by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, (b) the proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation, (c)
such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or (d) the proceeding (or part thereof) is brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement under an
indemnity agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The rights hereunder
shall be contract rights and shall include the right to be paid expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the payment of such expenses incurred by a
director or officer of the corporation in such person\'s capacity as a
director or officer in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
should be determined by judicial decision that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise.

  

    
 SECTION 7.02. _ Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_.  If a claim under Section 7.1 is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, or 20 days in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for 

        

expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this
corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which
make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the
corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper
in the circumstances because the claimant has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In
any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled
to recover such expenses upon a judicial decision that the indemnitee has not
met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware
General Corporation Law.

  

    
 SECTION 7.03. _ Indemnification of Employees and Agents_.  The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of related expenses, to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers of the corporation. 

  

    
 SECTION 7.04. _ Non-Exclusivity of Rights_.  The rights conferred on any person in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which such persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

   

    
 SECTION 7.05. _ Indemnification Contracts_.  The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or any person serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article VII. 

   

    
 SECTION 7.06. _ Insurance_.  The corporation may maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

   

    
 SECTION 7.07. _ Effect of Amendment_.  Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of an indemnitee or successor thereto in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.
