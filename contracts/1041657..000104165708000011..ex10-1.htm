listed in subsection (a) below and Radio One hereby agrees to sell,  assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to BIC on the Closing Date those items  listed
in subsections (b) through (g) below, together with any replacements  thereof

(c) The  towers, transmitters, antennas, receivers, spare parts and other

(g) Sellers'  proprietary information, technical information and data,
operating manuals,  books, studies, records, reports, ledgers, files,

operation of the Assets; provided,  however, that Sellers may provide Buyers
copies of any such items, if the  original cannot be located or if it relates
to Excluded Assets.

 

 

1.2   Excluded Assets. Except  for the Assets specifically identified above
(which identification,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, shall control in  the  event of any disagreement with the definition
of Excluded Assets below), no  other assets shall be transferred to Buyers
hereunder, including the following,  which shall not be included in the
Assets (collectively, the "Excluded  Assets"):

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)   All  cash, cash equivalents or similar investments such as
certificates of deposit,  treasury bills and other marketable securities on
hand and/or in banks and  deposits of either of the Sellers;

 

 

(b) All  accounts receivable of Sellers arising from the operation of the

(c) Except  as  set forth in Section 12.12 (Casualty), any insurance

(f) Any  interest in and to any refunds of federal, state or local franchise,

(l)   Any  other assets identified on Schedule  1.2(l).

 

 

1.3   Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations.  Subject  to obligations 
already assumed under the Time Brokerage Agreement, BIC shall assume and 
undertake to pay, discharge and perform all obligations and liabilities of 
Sellers (as to the Assumed Contracts and other Assets (but not as to the 
Licenses)) and BHC shall assume and undertake to discharge and perform all 
obligations and liabilities of Licensee (as to the FCC Licenses) arising or 
accruing after the Closing. Buyers shall not assume (i) any  obligation or
liabilities under Assumed Contracts relating to the period prior  to the
Closing, (ii) any obligations or liabilities of Sellers which are  unrelated
to the Assets being sold hereunder, (iii) any obligations relating  to 
employees of Sellers, (iv) any obligations relating to the Excluded Assets, 
(v)  any federal, state or local franchise, income or other taxes of Sellers,
or  (vi)  any other obligation or liability of either Seller.

 

 

1.4   Time Brokerage Agreement; Call Sign Change.

 

 

(a)   Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Sellers  and BIC are entering into the Time Brokerage Agreement. BIC's
programming of the  Station under the Time Brokerage Agreement shall commence
on the later of April  1, 2008 or that date which is two (2) business days
after the expiration or  termination of any waiting period applicable to the
proposed transaction under  the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act")  (the "Operational  Commencement Date").
To the extent that any assets and  liabilities are prorated under the Time
Brokerage Agreement, any obligation  of  Sellers under this Agreement to
prorate such assets or liabilities shall be  deemed satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  in this Agreement or
otherwise, Sellers shall not be deemed to have breached  or  failed to
comply with any representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements  with
respect to the Station or the Assets if such breach or failure is caused 
by  any act, omission or instruction of BIC under or in connection with the
Time  Brokerage Agreement or any activities or transactions by BIC in
furtherance  thereof or in connection therewith.

 

 

(b)   Buyer has selected (or shall select) new call letters for the Station
and has  notified (or shall notify) Sellers of its selection (the "New Call 
Letters"). Sellers shall make and diligently prosecute any  such selection at
the FCC (requesting the New Call Letters and that the New  Call  Letters
will become effective as promptly as possible (i.e., seven (7) days  from 
filing), but not earlier than the Operational Commencement Date) until the 
New  Call Letters become effective (subject to any FCC denial or prior third-
party  filing for the New Call Letters), and shall implement such call letter
change  once such change has become effective. In the event that this 
Agreement terminates without a Closing, Sellers and Buyers will cooperate to 
change the call letters of the Station from the New Call Letters (which may 
remain with Buyers) to call letters selected by Sellers, and shall make 
application filing with the FCC to effect such change. The previous  sentence
will survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

 

1.5 Allocation. The  Purchase Price shall be  allocated based upon the fair
market value of the Assets. Sellers and  Buyers may each obtain an appraisal
of the Assets prepared by Bond and Pecaro,  Inc. using valuation methods of
their choosing, and shall provide each other  with a copy of any such
appraisal, if obtained, as soon as reasonably possible  following Closing and
shall disclose to one another the allocation that each  intends to use in
their respective filings and the bases therefor. If  Sellers and Buyers plan
to use allocations that are inconsistent with one  another, they will discuss
such allocations for a period of up to 60 days  following Closing (or such
shorter time period sufficient to allow the Parties  to file their tax
returns when due) in an effort to reach an allocation upon  which both agree.
If a mutually agreeable allocation is not reached,  then Buyers and Sellers
shall each be free to use their own allocation in their  respective filings.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE  2

 

 

PURCHASE  PRICE

 

 

2.1   Purchase Price. The  purchase price for the Assets shall be One
Hundred Thirty-Seven Million Five  Hundred Thousand Dollars ($137,500,000)
(the "Purchase  Price"), payable in cash at the Closing, less that portion of
the Escrow  Amount (as defined below) simultaneously delivered to Sellers,
and subject  to  the prorations set forth in Section 2.3, by wire transfer
of immediately  available funds to one or more accounts at banks or other
financial institutions  pursuant to wire transfer instructions that Sellers
shall deliver to Buyers  at  least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

2.2   Escrow of Purchase Price. Simultaneously  with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Buyers will deposit Eleven  Million Dollars
($11,000,000) (the "Escrow  Amount") into escrow. The Escrow Amount shall be
held and  disbursed by Wilmington Trust NA (the "Escrow  Agent"), pursuant
to the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form  attached hereto as Exhibit
"A" (the "Escrow  Agreement"), which Escrow Agreement shall be signed by
Sellers, Buyers  and Escrow Agent simultaneously with the execution of this 
Agreement. At the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Escrow Amount  to be
paid to the Sellers and all interest accrued on the Escrow Amount to  be 
paid to Buyers. Buyers and Sellers agree to give the Escrow Agent  joint
written instructions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and  the
Escrow Agreement.

 

 

2.3 Prorations. Income  and Expense  Prorations. Subject to those prorations
already made under the  terms of the Time Brokerage Agreement, all income and
expenses arising from  the  conduct of the business and operations of the
Station shall be prorated between  Buyers and Seller as of 12:01 a.m. local
time on the Closing  Date. Except as specifically addressed in the Time
Brokerage  Agreement, such prorations shall be based upon the principle that
Sellers shall  be entitled to all income earned and shall be responsible for
all liabilities  and obligations accruing in connection with the Station's
operations until the  Closing Date, and BIC shall be entitled to such income
earned and be responsible  for such liabilities and obligations accruing in
connection with such operations  thereafter. Such prorations shall include
all ad valorem and other  property taxes (but excluding taxes arising by
reason of the transfer of the  Assets as contemplated hereby, which shall be
paid as set forth in Section  12.2  of this Agreement), deposits, utility
expenses, liabilities and obligations  under all Assumed Contracts, rents and
similar prepaid and deferred items,  and  all other expenses attributable to
the ownership and operations of the  Station. All real estate taxes and
personal property taxes, if any,  shall be apportioned on the basis of the
number of days that each Party owned  or  used the Real Property or Personal
Property during the relevant tax  year. The aggregate net adjustment amount
determined in  accordance with this Section is referred to herein as the
"Proration  Amount."

 

 

(a) Specific  Prorations. Subject to those prorations already made under
the  terms of the Time Brokerage Agreement, and without limiting the
generality  of  the foregoing Section 2.3(a):

 

 

(i) Sellers  shall receive a credit for the unapplied portion, as of the
Closing, of any  security deposits made by Sellers under the Assumed
Contracts; and

 

 

(ii) The  Buyers shall receive a prorated credit for any FCC annual
regulatory fees  relating to the Station paid in arrears by the Buyers and
any security deposits  received by Sellers under the Assumed Contracts.

 

 

(b) Proration  Notice. To the extent sufficient information is available 
regarding proration items as of the Closing Date, proration shall be made as 
of  the Closing Date. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the 
Buyers shall deliver to Sellers in writing and in reasonable detail a good 
faith  determination of the Proration Amount determined as of the Closing
Date (the  "Proration  Notice"). Sellers shall provide reasonable assistance
as  requested by the Buyers in making such determination. Buyers shall 
provide Sellers backup documentation supporting the Buyers' preparation of
the  Proration Amount. If Sellers disagree with the Proration Amount 
determined by Buyers, Sellers shall so notify the Buyers in writing (the
"Proration  Dispute  Notice") within thirty (30) days after the date of
receipt of the  Proration Notice, specifying in detail any point of
disagreement and providing  backup documentation supporting Seller's
calculations. After the  receipt of any Proration Dispute Notice, the Buyers
and Sellers shall negotiate  in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding the applicable Proration  Amount. If agreement is reached within
thirty (30) days after the  Buyers' receipt of the Proration Dispute Notice,
then upon reaching such  agreement, Sellers shall pay to the Buyers or the
Buyers shall pay to Sellers,  as the case may be, the Proration Amount in the
manner provided in Section  2.3(c) below.

 

 

(c) Payment  of Proration  Amount. Each payment of the Proration Amount
required hereunder shall be  paid by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the account of the  payee  at a financial institution in the United
States within five (5) business days  of  its final determination. Any
payment not received by the Party  entitled thereto within this period shall
bear interest from such date until  paid in full at a rate per annum equal to
the prime rate in effect at the end  of  such period (as published in the
Money Rates column of Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal) plus  four
percent (4%).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE  3

 

 

CLOSING

 

 

3.1   Closing. Subject  to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2  and subject to the provisions of Section 11.1,
the closing (the "Closing")  of the sale and purchase of the Assets shall
take place at a mutually agreeable  location or by electronic exchange of
signatures and payments on a date mutually  agreeable to Buyers and Sellers
no later than the fifth (5th)  business day after the date of the FCC Consent
(defined below); provided that  such date shall be no later than the Upset
Date (defined below) (the "Closing  Date").

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE  4

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

 

 

Each  Seller, each as to itself and its Assets, represents and warrants
jointly and  severally to Buyers that, subject to the specific terms herein
and to the  disclosures in the schedules referenced in this Article 4 (the
"Schedule  of  Exceptions"), the following representations and warranties
are true and  correct as of the date of this Agreement and will be true and
correct as of  the  Closing Date:

 

 

4.1 Organization  and Standing. Each  Seller (a) is duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the  laws  of the State of Delaware, (b)
is qualified to do business in all jurisdictions  where failure to do so
would have a material adverse effect on the business  of  the Station, and
(c) has all necessary power and authority to own, operate  and  lease its
respective Assets and carry on the business of the Station.

 

 

4.2 Authorization  and Binding  Obligation. Each  Seller has all 
necessary power and authority to enter into and perform its respective 
obligations under this Agreement and the documents contemplated hereby and 
to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This 
Agreement and the Time Brokerage Agreement have been, and each of the other 
documents contemplated hereby at or prior to Closing will be, duly executed 
and  delivered by Sellers, and have been approved by all necessary corporate
or  other  action. This Agreement constitutes (and each of the other
documents  contemplated hereby, when executed and delivered, will constitute)
valid and  binding obligations enforceable against Sellers in accordance with
their terms,  except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws  affecting creditors' rights generally or the availability of
equitable  remedies.

 

 

4.3 Absence  of Conflicting Agreements or Required  Consents. Except  for
the FCC Consents, HSR  Clearance (defined below) and necessary consents to
assignment indicated on  Schedules 1.1(b)  and  1.1(d), the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the  documents contemplated
hereby by each of the Sellers, respectively, do not  and  will not: (a)
violate any provisions of the organizational documents  of such Seller; (b)
violate any applicable law, judgment, order, ordinance,  injunction, decree,
rule, regulation or ruling of any court or governmental  authority; (c)
constitute a material default under, or accelerate or permit  the 
acceleration of any performance required by the terms of any of the Assumed 
Contracts, assuming any necessary consents are obtained; and (d) create any 
claim, Lien or encumbrance upon any of the Assets, except in each of the
above  instances where such breach or default would not have a material
adverse effect  on the Assets or on the ability of the Sellers to consummate
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

4.4   Litigation. Except  as disclosed on Schedule 4.4, there  are no
claims, litigation, arbitrations or other legal proceedings pending  or,  to
the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against Sellers with respect to the 
Assets or operation of the Station, except where such claims, litigation, 
arbitrations or other legal proceedings could not reasonably be expected to 
have  a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Station or
on the  ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

 

 

4.5   Station Licenses.

 

 

(a) Schedule  1.1(a)  contains a true and complete list of the FCC Licenses
used or held for use  in  connection with the operation of the Station as
currently  operated. Licensee is the authorized legal holder of the FCC
Licenses  listed on Schedule  1.1(a). Except as set forth on Schedule 
1.1(a), the  FCC Licenses are in good standing and in full force and effect.
The  Station and the facilities of the Station are being and have been
operated  during Sellers' ownership and operation of the Stations in material
compliance  with the FCC Licenses, the Communications Act and all FCC rules
and  policies. Except as set forth on Schedule 1.1(a), the  FCC Licenses are
all of the FCC licenses, permits and authorizations required  for the
operation of the Station as presently operated.

 

 

(b) Except  as  set forth in Schedule  1.1(a), and except for proceedings
affecting the radio broadcasting  industry generally, (i) to the Knowledge of
Sellers, there are no applications,  petitions, complaints, investigations,
notices of violations, notice of apparent  liabilities, pending license
terminations, forfeitures, proceedings or other  actions pending or
threatened from or before the FCC relating to the Station  or  the FCC
Licenses, (ii) Sellers have not filed with the FCC any applications  or 
petitions relating to the Station or the FCC Licenses which are pending
before  the FCC and (iii) there are no tolling or similar agreements with the
FCC  relating to the Station. Sellers and the Assets are in compliance  with
all rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration applicable 
to the Station. Each antenna structure that is required to be  registered
with the FCC has been registered with the FCC. All  material reports and
other filings required by the FCC with respect to the  Station have been
properly and timely filed.

 

 

(c) The  operation of the Station does not expose workers or others to levels
of radio  frequency radiation in excess of the "Radio Frequency Protection
Guides" recommended in "American National Standard Safety Levels with Respect
to Human  Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields 3 kHz to 300
GHz" (ANSI/IEEE  C95.1-1992), issued by the American National Standards
Institute, and renewal  of  the FCC Licenses would not constitute a "major
action" within the meaning of  Section 1.1301, et  seq., of the FCC's rules.

 

 

4.6   Real Property. The  list of Real  Property Leases set forth on
Schedule 1.1(b) is a  correct and complete list of all of the interests in
real estate used in  connection with the operation of the Station. Sellers
have a valid  leasehold interest in and to each Real Property Lease. Sellers
have  not received any notice (i) that either the whole or any portion of the
Real  Property is to be condemned, requisitioned or otherwise taken by any
public  authority, (ii) of violation by Sellers of restrictive covenants,
deed  restrictions or governmental requirements on the Real Property which
have not  been remedied, or (iii) of any violation by Sellers of any zoning
or  similar land use law or restriction, or of any proceedings which would
cause  the  change, redefinition or other modification of the zoning 
classification. Sellers have not received any notice of any pending  or
threatened termination or impairment of access to the Real Property or 
discontinuation of sewer, water, electrical, gas telephone or other
utilities  or  services to the Real Property. To the Knowledge of Sellers,
the Real  Property includes sufficient access to the Station's facilities
from public  roads without need to obtain any other access rights.

 

 

4.7   Contracts. Schedules  1.1(b) and  1.1(d) list all agreements with
respect to the Station to be conveyed  hereunder. Each of the Assumed
Contracts is in full force and effect  and is legally valid, binding and
enforceable by Seller in accordance with  their terms, except as limited by
laws affecting creditor's rights or  equitable principles generally. Except
as disclosed on Schedule 1.1(d),  neither Sellers nor, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, any other party thereto is  in  any material respect in default
under the Assumed Contracts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.8   Compliance with Laws. Except  as set forth in Schedule 4.8, Sellers 
have complied in all material respects with, and are not in any material
respect  in violation of, applicable federal, state or local laws, statutes,
rules,  regulations or orders relating to the ownership and operation of the
Station,  except where such violation would not have a material adverse
effect on the  Assets or on the ability of the Parties to consummate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers have  not received any
notice asserting any material noncompliance  with any applicable  statute,
rule or regulation, relating to the Assets  or in connection with the 
operation of the  Station. There  is no pending or, to the Knowledge of 
each of the  Sellers, threatened  investigation, audit, review or other
examination of the Station, and Sellers are  not subject to any order,
agreement,  memorandum of understanding or other regulatory enforcement
action or proceeding  with or by the FCC or any other federal or state
governmental agency having  supervisory or regulatory authority with respect
to the Station or the Assets.

 

 

4.9   Governmental Consents. Except  for the FCC Consent and the HSR
Clearance (defined below), the execution,  delivery and performance by the
Sellers of this Agreement and the other  documents contemplated herein, and

thereby, do not and will not require the  authorization, consent, approval,
exemption, clearance or other action by or  notice or declaration to, or
filing with, any court, administrative or other  governmental body.

withholding, social security and workers' compensation taxes and estimated
income and franchise tax payments, penalties  and fines) reflected as due on
such returns, reports or declarations (whether  or  not shown on such
returns, reports or declarations), or pursuant to any  assessment received in
connection with such returns, reports or declarations  have been paid, the
non-filing or non-payment of which is reasonably likely  to  have a material
adverse impact on the Assets. To the Knowledge of the  Sellers, (i) all such
returns, reports and declarations are true, complete  and  correct in all
material respects; (ii) no deficiency in payment of any Taxes  related to the
Assets for any period has been asserted by any taxing authority  which
remains unsettled as of the date hereof, no written inquiries have been 
received from any taxing authority with respect to possible claims for taxes 
or  assessments on the Assets, and there is no basis for any additional
claims  or  assessments for Taxes on the Assets, the consequences of which,
in each case,  is  reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on
the Assets.

required to file with  the  FCC in respect of the Station have been filed,
and all reporting requirements  of  the FCC have been complied with in all

private party  regarding any Environmental Laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.13   Broker's Fees. Neither  of the Sellers, nor any person or entity
acting on either of the Seller's  behalf, has agreed to pay a commission,
finder's fee or similar payment in  connection with this Agreement or any
matter related hereto to any person or  entity, and no person or entity is
entitled to any such payment from either  of  the Sellers in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  other than a payment owed
by Sellers to Star Media Group pursuant to a separate  agreement with them.
The Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless  the Buyers for any payment due
to Star Media Group or any other broker claiming  by, through or under
Sellers in connection with the transaction contemplated  by  this Agreement.

 

 

4.14   Insurance. Sellers  maintain insurance policies or other arrangements
with respect to the Station  and the Assets consistent with its practices for
other stations, including  coverage of all buildings, towers, antennas,
dishes, transmission lines,  transmitters and other Assets used in the
operation of the Station,  and will maintain such policies or arrangements
until the  Closing. Sellers have not received notice from any issuer of
such  policies of its intention to cancel, terminate or refuse to renew any
policy  issued by it with respect to the Station and the Assets. Set forth

policies or arrangements  with respect to the Station and the Station Assets.

items of Personal Property included in the  Assets. Sellers have good and
marketable title to the Personal  Property free and clear of Liens. All items

excepted and are suitable  for the purpose for which such items are presently
used. The Assets  include all the assets necessary to conduct the
broadcasting operations of  the  Station in all material respects as
currently operated by Sellers other than  personnel, Excluded Assets and
agreements that are not Assumed  Contracts.

 

 

4.16   Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT  AS OTHERWISE  SPECIFICALLY SET
FORTH HEREIN, THE ASSETS ARE BEING SOLD "AS-IS, WHERE-IS" AND SELLERS  MAKE
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY WITH REGARD TO THE SAME. THIS  DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTIES, INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 

 

4.17   Buyers' Representations and Warranties. Sellers  have not relied on
or been induced to enter into this Agreement by any  statement,

ARTICLE  5

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF BUYERS

 

 

Each  Buyer represents and warrants jointly and severally to Sellers that
the  following representations and warranties are true and correct as of the
date  of  this Agreement and will be true and correct as of the Closing
Date:

 

 

5.1   Organization and Standing. BIC  is a corporation and BHC is a non-
profit corporation, both of which are formed,  validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of  Utah. As of the Closing Date, each
Buyer will be qualified to do  business in all jurisdictions where the
failure to so qualify would have a  material adverse effect on its business.

 

 

5.2 Authorization  and Binding  Obligation. Each  Buyer has all necessary
power and authority to enter into and perform its  obligations under this
Agreement and the documents contemplated hereby and  to  consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This  Agreement and the Time
Brokerage Agreement have been, and each of the other  documents contemplated
hereby at or prior to Closing will be, duly executed  and  delivered by
Buyers, and have been approved by all necessary corporate  action. This
Agreement constitutes (and each of the other documents  contemplated hereby,
when executed and delivered, will constitute) valid and  binding obligations
enforceable against Buyers in accordance with their terms,  except as may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws  affecting
creditors' rights generally or the availability of equitable  remedies.

 

 

5.3   Absence of Conflicting Agreements or Required Consents. Except  for
the FCC Consents and the HSR Clearance, the execution, delivery and 
performance of this Agreement by Buyers does not and will not: (a)  violate
any provision of either of the Buyers' organizational documents; (b)  require
the consent of any governmental authority; (c) violate any material  law, 
judgment, order, injunction, decree, rule, regulation or ruling of any 
governmental authority; and (d) either alone or with the giving of notice or 
the  passage of time or both, conflict with, constitute grounds for
termination  or  acceleration of, or result in a breach of the terms,
conditions or provisions  of, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
lease, instrument, license  or  permit to which either of the Buyers is now
subject.

 

 

5.4   Absence of Litigation. There  is no claim, litigation, arbitration or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge  of Buyers, threatened, before or by
any court, governmental authority or  arbitrator relating to Buyers that
seeks to enjoin or prohibit, or that could  hinder or impair, the Buyers'
performance of their obligations under this  Agreement.

 

 

5.5   FCC Qualifications. To  Buyers' Knowledge, BHC is qualified under the
Communications Act of 1934, as  amended (the "Communications  Act") and the
rules and regulations of the FCC, including without  limitation the multiple
ownership rules, as in effect on the date hereof, to  be  an assignee of the
FCC Licenses. Buyers are not aware of any fact  that would, under present law
(including published policies of the FCC),  disqualify BHC from being the
assignee of the Station or that would delay FCC  approval of the assignment
of the FCC Licenses.

 

 

5.6   Broker's Fees. Neither  of the Buyers nor any person or entity acting
on either of the Buyers' behalf  has agreed to pay a commission, finder's fee
or similar payment in connection  with this Agreement or any matter related
hereto to any person or entity, and  no  person or entity is entitled to any
such payment from the Buyers in connection  with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyers  shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers for any payment due to any broker  or agent based on any
agreement made by Buyers.

 

 

5.7   Sellers' Representations and Warranties. Buyers  have not relied on or
been induced to enter into this Agreement by any  statement, representation
or warranty other than those expressly set forth  in  Article 4 of this
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE  6

 

 

GOVERNMENTAL  CONSENTS

 

 

6.1   FCC Application.

 

 

 

(a)   The  assignments of the FCC Licenses as contemplated by this Agreement
are subject  to  the prior consent and approval of the FCC. Prior to the
Closing, Buyers shall  not directly or indirectly control, supervise, direct,
or attempt to control,  supervise, or direct, the operation of the Station,
and such operation,  including complete control and supervision of all of the
Station's programs,  employees, and policies, shall be the sole
responsibility of Sellers as the  operator of the Station until the Closing,
subject to the provisions of the  Time  Brokerage Agreement.

 

 

 

(b) Buyers  and Sellers shall prepare and jointly file the FCC Applications
within five  (5)  business days after the date of this Agreement. The
Parties shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the FCC to accept
the FCC Applications  for filing as soon as practicable after such filing;
provided, however, that  neither Sellers nor Buyers shall have any obligation
to satisfy any complainant  or the FCC by taking any steps which would have a
material adverse effect upon  BHC, BIC, Licensee or Radio One, but neither
the expense nor inconvenience  to a  Party of defending against a
complainant or an inquiry by the FCC shall be  considered a material adverse
effect on such Party. Buyers and  Sellers shall thereafter prosecute the FCC
Applications in good faith and with  all reasonable diligence and otherwise
use their commercially reasonable efforts  to obtain the grant of the FCC
Applications as expeditiously as  practicable. Neither Party will take any
action that it knows, or  reasonably believes, would disqualify the FCC
Applications. If  rehearing, reconsideration or judicial review is sought by
a third party or  by  the FCC on its own motion with respect to the FCC
Consent, Buyers and Sellers  shall vigorously oppose such efforts for
rehearing, reconsideration or judicial  review; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall be construed to limit  either Party's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Article 11  (Termination Rights).

 

 

(c) Each  Party shall bear one-half of the cost of the FCC filing fees for
the FCC  Applications. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses 
(including the legal fees and disbursements of its counsel) in connection
with  the preparation of the portion of the FCC Applications to be prepared
by it  and  in connection with the processing and defense of the
application.

 

 

(d) In  the event  that a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental,
regulatory or  administrative agency or commission pursues an order, decree
or ruling or takes  any other action that seeks to restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyers
and Sellers shall each  use  commercially reasonable efforts to oppose and
to prevent the issuance of such  an  order, decree or ruling; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall be  construed to limit either Party's
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Article 11 (Termination
Rights).

 

 

6.2   HSR Filings. If  the Buyers and Sellers have not previously made the
filings required under  the  HSR Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  (which shall include a request for early
termination of the waiting period  thereunder) (the "HSR  Filings"), the
Parties shall, within five (5) business days after the  date of this
Agreement, make the HSR Filings following the execution of this  Agreement.
Buyers and Sellers will use their commercially reasonable  efforts to obtain
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,  and  will
promptly take all necessary and proper steps and respond to any requests  for
additional information, in order to comply with the requirements of the 
HSR  Act; provided, however, that the Buyers will not be required to
disclose  financial information relating to Buyers' Affiliates to any
governmental  agency. Buyers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to  persuade any such governmental agency that any such Affiliate information
should  not be required. Expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting  period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as "HSR  Clearance."
Each party shall bear one-half of the cost of the  HSR Filings. Each Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses  (including the legal fees and
disbursements of its counsel) in connection with  the preparation of its
portion of the HSR Filings and in connection with the  prosecution of such
filings.

covenants or agreements herein;

 

 

(ii) Sellers  will notify Buyers of supplements or amendments to the Schedule
of Exceptions  with respect to any matter arising after the date of this

obligation to remedy any such inaccuracy  in a timely manner.

 

 

(iii) Except  as  noted on Schedule 1.1(a), Sellers will comply in all
material respects with  all  laws applicable to each Seller's use of the

of the FCC;

 

 

(iv) Sellers  will maintain the Assets in customary repair, maintenance and
condition, except  for wear and tear incurred in the ordinary course of
business;

 

 

(v) Except  as  noted on Schedule 1.1(a), Sellers will maintain in full
force and effect the  FCC  Licenses relating to the Station and the Assets
and take any action necessary  before the FCC, including the preparation and
prosecution of applications for  renewal of the FCC Licenses, if necessary,
to preserve such licenses in full  force and effect without material adverse
change; and

 

 

(vi) Sellers  will maintain in full force and effect reasonable property
damage and liability  insurance on the Assets in at least the amount provided
for by the policies  currently maintained by Sellers.

 

 

(b) Negative  Covenants.  Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, subject to the Time  Brokerage Agreement and except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement or  with  the prior written consent of Buyers:

 

 

(i) Sellers  will not terminate, modify or amend any Assumed Contract or
commit to any act  or  fail to take any action that would cause a breach of
any Assumed Contract except  in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice;

 

 

(ii) Neither  Seller will create or permit any Lien on any of the Assets;

 

 

(iii) Neither  Seller will sell, assign, lease or otherwise transfer or
dispose of any of  the  Assets, except for the Assets consumed or disposed

better functionality; and

 

 

(iv) Except  as  noted on Schedule 1.1(a), Sellers will not modify or amend,

Station.

 

 

(c) Affirmative  Covenants of  Buyers. Buyers shall promptly notify Sellers
in writing if  Buyers have Knowledge prior to the Closing of: (i) any

event that may result  in a  violation of any covenants, conditions or
agreements to be complied with or  satisfied by Buyers under this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such notice  shall qualify or otherwise limit in
any way Buyers' representations, warranties,  covenants or agreements herein.

 

 

7.2   Access. Between  the date hereof and the Closing Date and during
regular business hours (so  long  as it would not unreasonably interfere
with the operations of Sellers), Sellers  will afford BIC, its counsel,
accountants, environmental consultants, appraisers  and other advisers and
representatives, upon reasonable advance notice, access  to the Station and
Real Property to review and inspect the Assets and the  Station, to inspect
and copy all Assumed Contracts, environmental and  engineering studies and
reports, and other documents and contracts relating  to  the Assets.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.3   No Inconsistent Action. Between  the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, each Party shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the fulfillment at the earliest  practicable date of all of the conditions to
the obligations of such Party  to  consummate the sale and purchase of the
Station and shall take no actions which  are inconsistent with its
obligations under this Agreement or that would  materially hinder or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. In
particular, neither Party shall take any action  that would jeopardize the
FCC Licenses, result in its disqualification to hold  the FCC Licenses, or in
any way delay grant of the FCC Application or  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyers  shall take no action
which would impair their financial or other qualifications  to consummate
this transaction in accordance with its terms. Should  either Party become
aware of any such fact or circumstance, such Party shall  promptly inform the
other. In the event that the Upset Date is within  ten (10) business days or
less, and either Party is prepared to close the  transaction contemplated by
this Agreement and believes that all of the  conditions precedent to the
other Party's obligations to close the transaction  have been fulfilled or
waived by such Party, it may provide such Party written  notice indicating
the same, and the Party receiving notice shall, within five  (5) business
days following receipt thereof, either (i) indicate in writing  its 
reasonable, good faith determination that one or more conditions precedent 
have  not been fulfilled or waived, or (ii) complete the Closing by the
Upset  Date.

 

 

7.4   Confidentiality. Each  Party shall keep confidential all information
obtained by it with respect to  the  other Parties in connection with this
Agreement, except where such information  is known through other lawful
sources or where its disclosure is required in  accordance with applicable
law, including requirements of the FCC pursuant  to  the FCC Applications.
If the transactions contemplated hereby are not  consummated for any reason,
Buyers and Sellers shall return to each other,  without retaining a copy
thereof in any medium whatsoever, any schedules,  documents or other written
information, including all financial information,  obtained from the other in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereby.

 

 

7.5   Further Assurances. Sellers  and Buyers shall cooperate and take such
actions, and execute such other  documents, at the Closing or thereafter, as
may be reasonably requested by  the  other in order to carry out the
provisions and purposes of this Agreement,  including, for example, promptly
advising each other of all communications  relevant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement received from the  FCC after the date of this
Agreement and furnishing each other with copies  of  all such written
communications.

 

 

7.6   Transition Efforts. Subject  to the provisions of the Time Brokerage
Agreement, beginning at the Closing,  Sellers shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to accomplish a  timely, smooth, uninterrupted and
organized transfer of the  Assets. Sellers agree to remove all of its
personnel from, and turn  over quiet possession to Buyers of the Real
Property pursuant to the Real  Property Leases concurrently with the Closing.

 

 

7.7   Press Releases. The  Sellers and the Buyers agree that, from the date
hereof through the Closing  Date, or, in the event this Agreement is
terminated, for a period of one (1)  year following termination, no public
release or announcement concerning the  transactions contemplated hereby
shall be issued by either Party without the  prior consent of the other
Party, except as such release or announcement may  be  required by any law
or the rules or regulations of the United States or any  state therein, in
which case the Party required to make the release or  announcement shall,
allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such  release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
Radio One may elect to issue a press release and/or an 8-K,  or  similar
notification, announcing the transaction contemplated in this  Agreement.
Radio One will provide Buyers a copy thereof prior to  issuance.

 

 

7.8 FCC  Authorizations.  Except  as noted on Schedule  1.1(a), during
the period prior to Closing, Sellers shall not cause or  permit any
modification of any FCC License without the Buyers' advance written  consent,
provided that Buyers shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or  delay its
consent if the modification is necessary for the Sellers to be in  compliance
with the Communications Act and such modification is not materially  adverse
to the interests of Buyers or the Station. Sellers shall use  commercially
reasonable efforts to correct any known technical deficiencies,  errors or
inconsistencies on the FCC Licenses, including those identified on 
Schedule  1.1(a), provided that resolution thereof will not be a condition
to  Closing.

 

 

7.9   Consents; Benefit of Agreements.   The Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (but the Sellers shall  not  be required to make any
payment except in connection with the FCC Consents)  to  obtain all consents
and approvals required for the assignment of the Assumed  Contracts and an
estoppel certificate from the lessor under the Real Property  Leases (if
consent to assignment is required thereunder), but no such consents  or
estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except for the Required 
Consents (defined below). Receipt of consent to assign to Buyers the 
Station's main tower lease and studio site lease marked with an asterisk (*)
on Schedule  1.1(b), and estoppel certificates reasonably acceptable to BIC
and Radio  One in connection therewith, is a condition precedent to Buyers'
obligation to  close under this Agreement, if consent to assignment is
required thereunder  (the "Required  Consent"). Subject to the foregoing,
if, with respect to any  lease, commitment or agreement to be assigned to
BIC, a required consent to  the  assignment is not obtained, the Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable  efforts to keep it in effect and give the
Buyers the benefit of it to the same  extent as if it had been assigned, and
the Buyers shall perform the Sellers' obligations under the agreement
relating to the benefit obtained by the  Buyers. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed as an attempt to  assign any agreement or other instrument
that is by its terms non-assignable  without the consent of the other party.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

10.1   Sellers' Indemnities. From  and after the Closing, Sellers shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the  Buyers and their Affiliates, and
their respective shareholders, directors,  officers, employees, and
representatives from and against, and reimburse them  for, all claims,
damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses, including  interest,
penalties, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses  (each, a
"Loss" and  together, "Losses"),  resulting from:

 

 

(a)   Any  breach, misrepresentation, failure or omission to perform, or
other violation  by  either Seller of any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants  or  agreements in this Agreement or in any
certificate, document or instrument  delivered by Sellers to Buyers under
this Agreement;

 

 

(b) Any  third-party claims brought against any Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to the  extent attributable to Sellers' operation of the Station
prior to the Closing;  or

 

 

(c) Any  liability or obligation of any Seller not assumed by any Buyer under
this  Agreement, including any liabilities arising at any time under any
contract  or  agreement not included in the Assumed Contracts.

 

 

10.2   Buyers' Indemnities. From  and after the Closing, Buyers shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each  of  the Sellers and its
Affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members,  directors, officers,
employees, and representatives, and the successors and  assigns of any of
them, from and against, and reimburse them for, all Losses  resulting from:

 

 

(a)   Any  breach, misrepresentation, failure or omission to perform, or
other violation  by  either Buyer of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements  in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or
instrument delivered by  Buyers to Sellers under this Agreement;

 

 

(b) Any  third-party claims brought against any Seller or any of its
Affiliates to the  extent attributable to Buyers' operation of the Station or
use of the Assets  following the Closing; or

 

 

(c) Any  liability or obligation assumed by any Buyer under this Agreement,
including  any  liabilities arising after Closing under the Assumed
Contracts.

 

 

10.3   Procedure for Indemnification. The  procedure for indemnification
shall be as follows:

 

 

(a)   The  Party seeking indemnification under this Article 10 (the
"Claimant")  shall give notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought (the "Indemnitor")  of any Loss, reasonably specifying (i) the factual
basis for the Loss; and  (ii)  the amount of the Loss if then known. If the
Loss relates to an  action, suit or proceeding filed by a third party against
Claimant, notice  shall  be given by Claimant within fifteen (15) business
days after written notice  of  the action, suit or proceeding was given to
Claimant. In all other  circumstances, notice shall be given by Claimant
within sixty (60) days after  Claimant becomes aware of the facts giving rise
to the  Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this paragraph, delay or 
failure to timely give notice of a Loss shall not affect or limit the 
Indemnitor's obligation to indemnify hereunder except to the extent that the 
Indemnitor is prejudiced by such delay or failure.

 

 

(b) The  Claimant shall make available to Indemnitor and/or its authorized 
representatives the information relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate 
the  Loss.

 

 

(c) With  respect to any Loss resulting from a claim by a third party as to
which the  Claimant is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitor
shall, without  prejudice to its rights to contest the obligation to
indemnify, defend against  the claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to
Claimant, and the Claimant  shall  cooperate fully with the Indemnitor,
subject to reimbursement for reasonable  expenses incurred by the Claimant as
the result of a request by the  Indemnitor. The Claimant shall have the right
to participate in the  defense of the claim at its own expense. If the
Indemnitor does not  assume control of the defense of any third party claim,
Claimant may, but shall  have no obligation to, defend or settle such claim
or litigation in such a  manner as it deems appropriate, and in such event
Indemnitor shall be bound  by  the results obtained by the Claimant with
respect to the claim (by default  or  otherwise) and shall promptly
reimburse Claimant for the amount of all expenses  (including the amount of
any judgment rendered), legal or otherwise, incurred  in  connection with
such claim or litigation. The Indemnitor shall be  subrogated to all rights
of the Claimant against any third party with respect  to  any Loss for which
indemnity was paid.

 

 

10.4   Limitations. The  Indemnitor shall only be required to indemnify the
Claimant under this Article  10 for breach of representations and warranties
if: (i) Claimant's written  notice of the Loss under this Article 10 is
received by the Indemnitor within  one (1) year following Closing (the
"Survival  Period"); (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds $200,000,
after  which the Claimant shall be entitled to recover, and the Indemnitor
shall be  obligated for, all Losses in excess of $100,000; and (iii) the
aggregate amount  of all Losses relating to all claims is less than
$7,500,000; provided that  the  limitations set forth in subsection (i),
(ii) and (iii) of this Section 10.4  shall not apply to Losses relating to a
breach by Sellers of their  representations in Section 4.1 (Organization and
Standing), Section 4.2  (Authorization and Binding Obligation), Section 4.3
(Absence of Conflicting  Agreements), or Section 4.5 (Station Licenses, but
only as regards holding  the  FCC Licenses), though claims for Losses under
such provisions may not be  asserted beyond their applicable statute of
limitation periods. In  calculating the amount of Losses of a Claimant under
this Article  10: (a) such Losses shall be reduced by any recovery from any
third  party (including insurance proceeds) as a result of the facts or
circumstances  giving rise to the Losses; and (b) Losses shall only include
the Party's actual  out-of-pocket costs and expenses and not any punitive,
special, consequential  (such as lost profits) or other indirect damages.

 

 

10.5   Exclusive Remedies. Buyers  and Sellers acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing indemnification provisions  in this Article 10 shall be the
exclusive remedy of Buyers and Sellers with  respect to Losses after the
Closing relating to the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement.
Buyers and Sellers further acknowledge and agree that  the Closing under this
Agreement, including any waiver of conditions to Closing,  does not limit or
waive in any respect any claim that Buyers or Sellers may  have  under this
Article 10. Either Party may pursue injunctive relief to  enforce covenants
in the Agreement that survive the Closing and are supportable  under
applicable law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE  11

 

 

TERMINATION  RIGHTS

 

 

11.1   Termination.

 

 

(a) In  addition to other remedies available prior to Closing, this Agreement
may be  terminated by either Buyers or Sellers, if the Party seeking to
terminate is  not  in material default or breach of this Agreement, upon
written notice to the  other, if:

 

 

(i) the  other  Party is in material breach of this Agreement and such
breach has been neither  cured within the cure period allowed under
subsection (d) below nor waived  by  the Party giving such termination
notice;

 

 

(ii) a  court  of competent jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or
administrative agency  or commission shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other  action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
such order, decree, ruling  or  other action shall have become final and
non-appealable; or

 

 

(iii) the  Closing has not occurred by April 1, 2009 (the "Upset  Date").

 



 

(b)   This  Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of Buyers
and  Sellers.

 

 

(c)   Buyers  may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Sellers in
the event that  the  U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, or any other  governmental agency, requires the disclosure of any
financial information  relating to any of Buyer's Affiliates in connection
with this  transaction. Buyers agree to use reasonable efforts to persuade
any  such government agency that any such required Affiliate information
should  not  be required prior to exercising this right of termination.

 

 

(d) If  either  Party believes the other to be in breach or default of this
Agreement, the  non-defaulting Party shall, prior to exercising its right to
terminate under  Section 11.1(a)(i), provide the defaulting Party with notice
specifying in  reasonable detail the nature of such breach or default. Except
for a  failure to pay the Purchase Price or the failure to complete the
Closing, the  defaulting Party shall have thirty (30) days, from receipt of
such notice to  cure such default. If the cure period set forth in the
previous  sentence would extend beyond the Upset Date, then notwithstanding
the definition  of Upset Date set forth in Section 11.1(a)(iii) hereof, the
term Upset Date  shall mean the date one business day after the 30-day
period.

 

 

11.2   Payment of Escrow Amount. The  Escrow  Amount shall be promptly
released from escrow upon termination of  this Agreement under this Article
11 and delivered as follows:

 

 

(a)   to  Sellers as liquidated damages in the event this Agreement is
terminated by  Sellers pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i); or

 

 

(b)   to  Buyers in the event this Agreement is terminated due to any
other  reason.

 

 

11.3 Exclusive  Remedies Upon Default. The  Parties agree that in the event
the Sellers terminate this Agreement under  Section 11.1(a)(i) above,
Sellers' exclusive remedy shall be as set forth in  Section 11.2(a) above.
Buyers and Sellers agree that it would be  impractical and extremely
difficult to estimate the damages which Sellers may  suffer as a result of a
termination of this Agreement under the circumstances  described in Section
11.2(a) above, and agree that the Escrow Amount represents  a reasonable
estimate of the total net detriment that Sellers would suffer  under  such
circumstances and shall be the full, agreed and liquidated damages for 
termination under such circumstances. In the event of failure or  threatened
failure by Sellers to comply with the terms of this Agreement at  Buyers'
election, in addition to any other remedy available to it, Buyers shall  be
entitled to an injunction restraining such failure or threatened failure 
and,  subject to obtaining any necessary FCC consent, to enforcement of this
Agreement  by a decree of specific performance requiring compliance with this
Agreement,  in  each case without the necessity of showing economic loss or
other actual damage  and without any bond or other security being required.

 

 

11.4   Other Effects of Termination. The  following sections shall survive
the termination of this Agreement pursuant  to  this Article 11: 7.4
(Confidentiality), 7.7 (Press Releases), 11.3 (Exclusive  Remedies Upon
Default), 11.4 (Other Effects of Termination), and the provisions  in Article
12 (Other Provisions) and Article 13 (Definitions) that by their  terms would
survive termination.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE  12

 

 

OTHER  PROVISIONS

 

 

12.1   Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each  Party's
representation and warranties shall survive the Closing and continue  until
the end of the Survival Period, provided that those Sections cited as  not 
being subject to the Survival Period shall continue for the duration of
their  applicable statute of limitation periods. Each party's covenants and 
agreements hereunder shall survive Closing and continue until  performed.

 

 

12.2   Transfer Taxes and Expenses. All  recordation, transfer, documentary
fees, and sales taxes, if any, imposed on  this transaction shall be paid
one-half by Buyers and one-half by  Sellers. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each Party  shall be solely responsible for and shall pay all
other costs and expenses  (including attorney and accounting fees) incurred
by it in connection with  the  negotiation, preparation and performance of
and compliance with the terms of  this Agreement.

 

 

12.3   Benefit and Assignment. This  Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties  hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Neither Buyers  nor either Seller may assign its
rights or delegate its obligations under this  Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other Party, except that  either Buyers may assign the
Agreement in whole or in part to one or more of  its  Affiliates, provided
that it shall not be released thereby. Except as  expressly provided in this
Agreement, this Agreement is not intended to, nor  shall it, create any
rights in any person other than the Parties.

 

 

12.4   Additional Documents. The  Parties agree to execute, acknowledge and
deliver, before, at or after the  Closing Date, such further instruments and
documents as may be reasonably  required to implement, consummate and
effectuate the terms of this  Agreement.

 

 

12.5   Entire Agreement; Schedules; Amendment; Waiver. This  Agreement and
the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto and the Time  Brokerage
Agreement embody the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties 
hereto and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements and 
understandings relating to the matters provided for herein. Any  matter that
is disclosed in a schedule hereto shall be deemed to have been  included in
other pertinent schedules, notwithstanding the omission of an  appropriate
cross-reference. No amendment, waiver of compliance with  any provision or
condition hereof or consent pursuant to this Agreement shall  be  effective
unless evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by the Party  against
whom enforcement of any waiver, amendment or consent is  sought. No failure
or delay on the part of Buyers or Sellers in  exercising any right or power
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver  thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right or power, or  any  abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,  preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other  right or power.

 

 

12.6   Headings. The  headings set forth in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not  control or affect the meaning or construction
of the provisions of this  Agreement.

 

 

12.7   Computation of Time. If  after making computations of time provided
for in this Agreement, a time for  action or notice falls on Saturday, Sunday
or a federal holiday, then such  time  shall be extended to the next
business day.

 

 

12.8   Governing Law. The  construction and performance of this Agreement
shall be governed by the laws  of  the District of Columbia without regard
to any choice or conflicts of law  provision or rule (whether of the District
of Columbia or any other  jurisdiction).

 

 

12.9   Attorneys' Fees. In  the event of any dispute between the Parties to
this Agreement, Sellers or  Buyers, as the case may be, shall reimburse the
prevailing Party for its  reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred
in enforcing its rights or  exercising its remedies under this Agreement.
Such right of  reimbursement shall be in addition to any other right or
remedy that the  prevailing Party may have under this Agreement.

 

 

12.10   Severability. If  any term or provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person  or circumstance shall, to any extent, be
held invalid or unenforceable, the  remainder of this Agreement, or the
application of such term or provision to  persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is held invalid or  unenforceable, shall not be affected
thereby, and each such term and provision  of this Agreement shall be valid
and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted  by law.

 

 

12.11   Notices. Any  notice, demand or request required or permitted to be
given under this Agreement  shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the
following addresses or to  such  other address as any Party may request:

Any  such  notice, demand or request shall be deemed to have been duly
delivered and  received (a) on the date of personal delivery, (b) on the date
of transmission  if sent by facsimile, (c) on the date of receipt if mailed
by registered or  certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt
requested, or (d) on the  date  of a signed receipt if sent by an overnight
delivery service.

 

 

Casualty. The  risk of loss, damage or destruction to the Assets shall be on
Sellers prior  to  Closing and on Buyers thereafter. If, prior to the
Closing, any  material portion of the Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by
fire or other  casualty (collectively, "Casualty"),  Sellers shall deliver
to Buyers written notice ("Casualty  Loss  Notice") of such Casualty
together with Sellers' determination as to  whether the damage constitutes a
Material Damage. Buyers and Sellers shall  cooperate to repair or replace the
Assets affected by such Casualty as promptly  as practicable in a manner
reasonably acceptable to both Buyers and Sellers,  provided that the cost of
such repairs or replacement shall be borne by  Sellers. For the purposes of
this Section 12.12 only, "Material  Damage" shall mean damage to the Assets
which is of such nature that the  cost of restoring the same to their
condition prior to the Casualty will, in  Sellers' reasonable determination,
exceed $5,000,000, whether or not such damage  is covered by insurance, or
any damage which would reduce the value of either  the Assets by $5,000,000
or more. If, prior to the Closing, the  Assets sustain Material Damage by a
Casualty, Buyers may, at Buyers' option,  terminate this Agreement by
delivering written notice thereof to Sellers within  fifteen (15) business
days after Buyers' receipt of the Casualty Loss  Notice. If the Assets shall
be damaged by a Casualty which is not a  Material Damage, or if the Assets
sustain Material Damage by a Casualty, but  the  Buyers elect not to
terminate the Agreement as a result thereof, then the  parties shall proceed
to the Closing and the Sellers shall (at the Closing)  assign to Buyers all
of Sellers' rights in and to any insurance proceeds which  may become
available as a result of the Casualty at issue, and Sellers shall  remain
obligated to pay any deductible relating to the claim. If  Buyers elect to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.12, the entire  Escrow Amount
and all interest thereon shall be promptly returned to Buyers,  and 
thereafter neither party shall have any further rights or obligations
hereunder,  except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement.

 

 

12.12   Counterparts. This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be  deemed an original and all of which
together will constitute one and the same  instrument.

 

 

12.13   Facsimile or PDF Signatures.   The  Parties agree that transmission
to the other Party of this Agreement with its  facsimile or electronic "pdf"
signature shall bind the Party transmitting this  Agreement thereby in the
same manner as if such Party's original signature had  been delivered.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Party who  transmits this Agreement with
its facsimile or "pdf" signature covenants to  deliver the original thereof
to the other Party as soon as possible  thereafter.
