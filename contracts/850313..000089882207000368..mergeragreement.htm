Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and /or Merger Sub and, to Parent&#146;s knowledge, the other parties thereto. As of this date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth therein and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth therein on the part of Parent. Parent or Merger Sub has paid any and all commitment or other fees required by the Financing Commitments that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they become due. There are no side letters or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates are a party containing additional conditions precedent to the Financing. The proceeds funded under the Financing Commitments (or any alternative financing obtained pursuant to Section 6.11), when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments (or such alternative financing), will constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, together with not more than the Minimum Cash Amount will be sufficient for (i) the satisfaction of all Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option and Stock Based Consideration (including obligations under Section 1.1(e) and Section 3.2(a)) and (ii) any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the lenders thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to Parent on the terms therein, and the Equity Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the funding party to make the equity financing thereunder available to the Parent on the terms therein, and, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions precedent to the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter.</FONT></P>
