_Schedule 2.04(a)_ (collectively, the " _Accounting Principles_ "), (ii) a
reasonably detailed estimated calculation of the Tangible Book Value of the
Companies as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Tangible Book
Value_ ") based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and (iii) a written
certification of the Chief Financial Officer of Seller that such Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and such calculation of the Estimated Closing Tangible
Book Value have been prepared in good faith and in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. Seller shall reasonably consult with Acquiror with
respect to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value and shall consider
in good faith any comments thereto that may be provided by Acquiror prior to
Sellers delivery thereof; _provided_ that in the event of any disagreement
between the parties with respect to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or
the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value, the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
and the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value shall be as so provided by
Seller.

 

(b) At the Closing, Acquiror will pay, on behalf of itself and as agent for
National Interstate, the Closing Payment as follows, in each case in
accordance with _Section_



 

2   _2.09(a)_ : (i) an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount shall be
deposited by Acquiror into the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, which amount of cash shall thereupon become Escrow
Property; and (ii) an amount of cash equal to the Closing Payment, less the
Escrow Amount, shall be paid to Seller. The Escrow Property shall be held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent for the purpose of satisfying any post-closing
indemnification obligations of Seller under _Article X_ and any amounts
payable by Seller under _Section 2.06_ and _Section 2.07_, and shall be
administered in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.05 _Adjustment to Payment Made at Closing_.

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and
deliver to Acquiror (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of
the Closing Date that includes pro forma adjustments to reflect the
transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Plan, substantially in the form
set forth in _Exhibit B_ (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a reasonably
detailed calculation of the Tangible Book Value of the Companies as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Tangible Book Value_ ") and (iii) a written
certification of the Chief Financial Officer of Seller that such Closing
Balance Sheet and such calculation of the Closing Tangible Book Value have
been prepared in good faith and in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
The Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. If Seller does not deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to Acquiror
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, then, at the election of
Acquiror, either (x) Acquiror may prepare and deliver the Closing Balance
Sheet to Seller within an additional sixty (60) days thereafter or (y) the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value
will be deemed to be the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Tangible Book
Value in accordance with _Section 2.05(f)_. If Acquiror elects to prepare the
Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
then all subsequent references in _Sections 2.05(a)_ , _(b)_ ,  _(d)_ and
_(f)_ to Acquiror, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will be
deemed to be references to Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other
hand, respectively. In connection with Sellers preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet, to the extent that Seller does not have all relevant
information in its possession, Seller and its Representatives will be
permitted to review any books and records of the Companies relevant to the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing
Tangible Book Value with respect to the period up to and including the Closing
Date, and Acquiror will make reasonably available the individuals then in its
employ, if any, responsible for and knowledgeable about the preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Tangible Book Value
in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of Seller.

 

(b) During the sixty (60) days immediately following Acquirors receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Review Period_ "), Acquiror and its
Representatives will be permitted to review, at Acquirors sole cost and
expense, Sellers books, records and work papers, and the work papers of
Sellers independent accountants, if applicable, and other relevant
information relating to the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Tangible Book Value with respect to the period up to and including the
Closing Date, and Seller will make reasonably available the individuals then
in its employ responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in,
and the preparation of, the Closing Balance Sheet in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the independent accountants of Seller will not be obligated to make any work
papers available to Acquiror unless and until Acquiror

 



 

3  has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountant. The parties agree
that Acquirors review of the Closing Balance Sheet may include a formal
audit or review thereof by any independent accountants engaged by Acquiror in
accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards 100 or otherwise.

 

(c) Acquiror and Seller agree that, following the Closing through the date
that the Final Tangible Book Value becomes final and binding, neither party
will take, and each party will cause their respective Affiliates to refrain
from taking, any actions with respect to any accounting, books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Final Balance Sheet is to be based the
purpose of which is to impede or delay the determination of the Final Tangible
Book Value or the preparation of the Final Balance Sheet in the manner and
utilizing the methods contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Acquiror will notify Seller in writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
prior to the expiration of the Review Period if Acquiror disagrees with the
Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Tangible Book Value.
The Notice of Disagreement will set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such dispute, the amounts involved and Acquirors determination of the amount
of Closing Tangible Book Value. If no Notice of Disagreement is delivered by
Acquiror prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Closing
Balance Sheet and Sellers calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value will be
deemed to have been accepted by Acquiror and will become final and binding
upon the parties in accordance with _Section 2.05(f)_.

 

(e) During the twenty (20) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Consultation Period_ "), Seller and Acquiror will
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

 

(f) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, Seller and Acquiror have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and Acquiror will
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with copies of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value marked to indicate those line
items that are in dispute) to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (as determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.05(f)_, the " _Independent Accountant_ "). In
the event that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to
act as the Independent Accountant, the parties shall cooperate in good faith
to appoint an independent certified public accounting firm in the United
States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the parties, in which
event "Independent Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days
after the submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon
as practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant will make a final
determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, of the appropriate amount of each of the line
items in the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing
Tangible Book Value as to which Seller and Acquiror disagree as set out in the
Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each disputed line item, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or
Acquiror, shall not be more favorable to Acquiror than the amounts advocated
by Acquiror in the Notice of

 



 

4  Disagreement or more favorable to Seller than the amounts advocated by
Seller in the Closing Balance Sheet or Sellers calculation of Closing
Tangible Book Value with respect to such disputed line item. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) the Independent Accountants review of the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be limited to a determination of whether such document was
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles, (ii) the Independent
Accountants review of the Closing Tangible Book Value shall be limited to a
determination of whether such calculation was prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and the definition of Tangible Book Value set forth in
this Agreement, and (iii) the Independent Accountant shall not review any line
items or make any determination with respect to any matters not subject to a
dispute in the Notice of Disagreement. The determination of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value that
are final and binding on the parties, as determined either through the (w)
failure by Seller to timely deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation
of Closing Tangible Book Value pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_, (x) failure to
timely deliver a Notice of Disagreement pursuant to _Section 2.05(d)_, (y)
agreement of the parties pursuant to _Section 2.05(e)_ or (z) action of the
Independent Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.05(f)_, are referred to as
the " _Final Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Final Tangible Book Value_ ",
respectively.

 

(g) The cost of the Independent Accountants review and determination will be
shared equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, Acquiror and Seller will each
make available to the Independent Accountant interviews with such individuals,
and such information, books and records and related work papers, as may be
reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations
under _Section 2.05(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent
accountants of Seller or Acquiror will not be obligated to make any work
papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountant has been signed.

 

(h) The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " will be the amount equal to the Final
Tangible Book Value _minus_  the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value. If
the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount ( _i.e._ , the Final Tangible
Book Value exceeds the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value), then Acquiror
will pay to Seller the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment, and if the
Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount ( _i.e._ , the Final Tangible
Book Value is less than the Estimated Closing Tangible Book Value), then
Seller will pay to Acquiror an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Post-Closing Adjustment, in each case, together with interest thereon at the
Interest Rate calculated and payable in accordance with _Section 2.10_. Any
payment required by this _Section 2.05(h)_ shall be made within two (2)
Business Days after the Final Tangible Book Value is determined and shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by the recipient thereof.

 

(i) Seller shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Acquiror, at Acquirors
sole cost and expense, in obtaining information (including pro forma
financial information, but excluding the Audited Financial Statements, which
shall be delivered by Seller in accordance with _Section 5.22_) regarding
Vanliner Group relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date for
inclusion in National Interstates filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") that may be required under applicable Law. All such
information provided by Seller 



 

5  shall be true, accurate and complete in all material respects as of the date
on which such information is provided to Acquiror and Seller will promptly
notify Acquiror if, after the date on which such information is provided by
Seller to Acquiror, such information is, to the Knowledge of Seller, no longer
true, accurate and complete in all material respects. Seller shall reasonably
(A) cooperate with and assist Acquiror, at Acquirors sole cost and expense,
in preparing any audited consolidating financial statements of the Companies
and (B) assist Acquiror in obtaining approval from Ernst and Young LLP to file
the Audited Financial Statements, any such audited consolidating financial
statements and the necessary auditors consent in National Interstates
filings with the SEC; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be
required to compensate Ernst and Young LLP or any other Person, commence or
participate in litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to Ernst and Young LLP or any other Person to obtain any such consent
or approval.

 

Section 2.06 _Annual Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up_.

 

(a) By no later than March 31 of each year commencing in 2012 and ending in
2013, Acquiror will prepare and deliver to Seller:

(i) the Post-Closing Financial Statements as of the immediately preceding
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year;

(ii) (A) an adjusted Final Balance Sheet updated by Acquiror to reflect the
actual amounts paid, received or adjusted by the Companies during the period

, calculated as of the Closing Date, including a resetting of the Total

statement setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation, as of the
immediately preceding Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year, of the
Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Amount, and (C) a statement setting

Amount with respect to the immediately preceding Balance Sheet Guaranty True-
Up Year substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit I_ , in each case,

the Settlement Methodology and (III)  _Section 2.06(j)_; and

(iii) a written certification of the Chief Financial Officer of each of
Acquiror and Vanliner that such Initial Annual Reconciliation and such
calculations of the Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Amount and the
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount have been prepared in good faith and in
accordance with this Agreement, including this _Section 2.06_.

(b) During the sixty (60) days immediately following Sellers receipt of each
Initial Annual Reconciliation (each such period, a " _Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Review Period_ "), Seller and its Representatives will be permitted
to, and Seller may engage an actuary and its independent accountant to, audit
or review, at Sellers sole cost and expense, the audited statutory financial
statements of Vanliner and the related stand alone work papers (which may be
redacted to the extent necessary to remove information not relating to the
line items included in such Initial Annual Reconciliation and the calculations
of the Uncollectible Reinsurance

 



 

6  Receivables Amount and the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount) of
Acquiror and Acquirors actuaries and independent accountants relating to such
financial statements, and the Companies books, records and other relevant
financial information, in each case, relating to the line items included in
such Initial Annual Reconciliation and the calculations of the Uncollectible
Reinsurance Receivables Amount and the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount,
and Acquiror will make reasonably available the individuals then in its
employ, or in the employ of the Companies, responsible for and knowledgeable
about the information used in, and the preparation of, such Initial Annual
Reconciliation and the calculations of the Uncollectible Reinsurance
Receivables Amount and the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount in order to
respond to the reasonable inquiries of Seller; provided, however, that
Acquirors actuaries and independent accountants will not be obligated to
make any work papers available to Seller unless and until Seller has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Acquirors actuaries and independent
accountants.

(c) Seller will notify Acquiror in writing (each, a " _Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Balance
Sheet Guaranty True-Up Review Period with respect to each of the second and
third Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Years, if Seller disagrees with the
applicable Initial Annual Reconciliation. Each Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up
Notice of Disagreement will set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute, the amounts involved and Sellers determination of such amounts. If
no Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Notice of Disagreement is delivered by
Seller prior to the expiration of the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-
Up Review Period, then the applicable Initial Annual Reconciliation will be
deemed to have been accepted by Seller and will become final and binding upon
the parties in accordance with _Section 2.06(e)_.

 

(d) During the twenty (20) days immediately following the delivery of any
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Notice of Disagreement (each such period, a "
_Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Consultation Period_ "), Seller and Acquiror
will seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Notice of Disagreement.

(e) If, at the end of any Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Consultation Period,
Seller and Acquiror have been unable to resolve any differences that they may

Guaranty True-Up Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and Acquiror will submit
all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Notice of Disagreement (along with copies of the applicable Initial
Annual Reconciliation marked to indicate those line items that are
in dispute) to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (as determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.06(e)_, the " _Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert_
"). In the event that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP refuses or is
otherwise unable to act as the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent
Expert, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent
certified public accounting firm with actuarial expertise in the United States
of national recognition mutually agreeable to the parties, in which event
"Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert" shall mean such firm.
Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such matters to the Balance
Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert will make a
final determination, binding on the parties to

 



 

7  this Agreement and their respective Affiliates and Representatives, of the
appropriate amount of each of the line items in the applicable Initial Annual
Reconciliation as to which Seller and Acquiror disagree as set out in the
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each
disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position
of either Seller or Acquiror, shall not be more favorable to Seller than the
amounts advocated by Seller in the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up
Notice of Disagreement or more favorable to Acquiror than the amounts
advocated by Acquiror in the applicable Initial Annual Reconciliation with
respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Experts review of any Initial
Annual Reconciliation shall be limited to a determination of whether such
document was prepared in accordance with this _Section 2.06_ and (ii) the
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert shall not review any line
items or make any determination with respect to any matters not subject to a
dispute in the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Notice of
Disagreement. The determination of the adjusted Final Balance Sheet that is
final and binding on the parties with respect to each Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Year, as determined either through (x) failure to timely deliver a
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Notice of Disagreement pursuant to _Section
2.06(c)_, (y) agreement of the parties pursuant to _Section 2.06(d)_ or (z)
through the action of the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert
pursuant to this _Section 2.06(e)_, is referred to as the " _Final Annual
Reconciliation_ ".

 

(f) The cost of the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Experts review
and determination shall be shared equally by Seller, on the one hand, and
Acquiror, on the other hand. During the review by the Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Independent Expert, Acquiror and Seller will each make available to
the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert interviews with such
individuals, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may
be reasonably required by the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Independent
Expert to fulfill their obligations under _Section 2.06(e)_; provided,
however, that the actuaries and independent accountants of Seller or Acquiror
will not be obligated to make any work papers available to a Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Independent Expert unless and until such firm has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such actuaries or accountants, as
applicable.

 

(g) _Calculation of Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount_. With respect to
each Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year (other than the first Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Year), the " _Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount_ " will
be an amount calculated in accordance with this _Section 2.06(g)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, there will be no Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount

after December 31, 2012. The "Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount" for each
Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year (other than the first Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Year) will be calculated as follows:

(i) the Closing Date Net Reserves Amount;

(ii) __plus__ the Closing Date Net Unearned Premium Runoff Amount;

(iii) __plus__ the Net Unearned Premium Runoff from Post-Closing Bound
Policies as of the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year;



 

8 (iv) __minus__ the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year Net Reserves Amount;

(v) (A) __plus__ the Other Balance Sheet Account Difference Amount as of the

Difference Amount as of the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year,

applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year, if such amount is positive, or
(B) _ _plus__ the absolute value of the Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables
Amount as of the applicable Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year, if such
amount is negative.

(h) _Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Payment and Release of Escrow Property
for the second Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year_.

 

(i) _Positive Adjustment_. If the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount

True-Up Amount, decreased by any Taxes actually incurred, or increased by any
Tax savings actually derived, by Acquiror with respect to such Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Amount, together with interest thereon at the Escrow Rate
calculated and payable in accordance with _Section 2.10_, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller and
(B) Acquiror and Seller will execute and deliver a joint instruction to the

Agent.

 

(ii) _Negative Adjustment_. If the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount
calculated as of the second Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year is _a
negative amount_ , then, within two (2) Business Days after the date on which
the Final Annual Reconciliation with respect to the second Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Year becomes such in accordance with _Section 2.06(e)_,

Acquiror with respect to such Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount,
together with interest thereon at the Escrow Rate calculated and payable in
accordance with _Section 2.10_; _provided_ that, if the amount owing to
Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 2.06(h)(ii)_ exceeds the amount of the
Escrow Property, then Seller shall deliver to Acquiror an amount of cash
equal to such excess. If, after any such release of Escrow Property by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with this _Section 2.06(h)(ii)_, the remaining
Escrow Property is less than the applicable Retained Amount ( _i.e._ ,
$25,000,000), Seller shall promptly



 

9  (and in any case within two (2) Business Days following such release)
deposit additional funds with the Escrow Agent in an amount equal to the
applicable Retained Amount ( _i.e._ , $25,000,000) _less_ the actual Escrow
Property then on deposit in the Escrow Account, which additional funds shall

Up Amount calculated as of the second Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year is a
negative amount.

Final Annual Reconciliation with respect to the third Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Year becomes such in accordance with _Section 2.06(e)_, Acquiror and
Seller will execute and deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly release (in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement) (x) to Acquiror the absolute value of the Balance Sheet

thereon at the Escrow Rate calculated and payable in accordance with 
_Section 2.10_; _provided_ that, if the amount owing to Acquiror pursuant to
this _Section 2.06(i)(i)(A)_ exceeds the amount of the Escrow Property, then
Seller shall deliver to Acquiror an amount of cash equal to such excess, and
(y) to Seller any remaining Escrow Property in excess of the applicable
Retained Amount ( _i.e._ , $16,250,000) then on deposit in the Escrow Account

any such release of Escrow Property by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
clause (x) of this _Section 2.06(i)(i)(A)_, the remaining Escrow Property is
less than the applicable Retained Amount ( _i.e._ , $16,250,000), Seller

True-Up Year becomes such in accordance with _Section 2.06(e)_, (x) Acquiror
will pay to Seller an amount equal to the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up
Difference



 

10  Amount, decreased by any Taxes actually incurred, or increased by any Tax
savings actually derived, by Acquiror with respect to such Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Difference Amount, together with interest thereon at the
Escrow Rate calculated and payable in accordance with _Section 2.10_, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Seller and (y) Acquiror and Seller will execute and deliver a joint

Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount calculated as of the third Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Year is _a negative amount_ , and:

 

(A) the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Difference Amount is _a positive
amount_ , then, within two (2) Business Days after the date on which the

Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount, after giving effect to the payment, if
any, described in (x) above; or

 

(B) the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Difference Amount is _a negative
amount_ , then, within two (2) Business Days after the date on which the
Final Annual Reconciliation with respect to the third Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Year becomes such in accordance with _Section 2.06(e)_, Acquiror and

Property, then Seller 



 

11  shall deliver to Acquiror an amount of cash equal to such excess. If, after
any such release of Escrow Property by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
this _Section 2.06(i)(ii)(B)_, the remaining Escrow Property is less than
the applicable Retained Amount ( _i.e._ , $16,250,000), Seller shall promptly
(and in any case within two (2) Business Days following such release) deposit
additional funds with the Escrow Agent in an amount equal to the applicable
Retained Amount ( _i.e._ , $16,250,000) _less_ the actual Escrow Property then
on deposit in the Escrow Account, which additional funds shall be held by the
Escrow Agent as Escrow Property in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Escrow Property will be released to Seller
pursuant to this _Section 2.06(i)_ if the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up
Amount calculated as of the third Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year is a
negative amount.

 

(j) The parties hereby agree that, notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, for purposes of (A) preparing any statement, settlement or
proposal required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_, or (B) determining or
calculating any payment amount required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section
2.07_, the effects of any and all of the following shall be disregarded:

(i) any failure by Acquiror or the Companies to use commercially reasonable
efforts fully enforce all of the Companies rights under all reinsurance
agreements, vendor contracts and other agreements to which any Company is a
party;

 

(ii) any failure by Acquiror or the Companies to (A) operate the Business, as
it relates to the Pre-Closing Vanliner Policies and the Post-Closing Bound
Policies, in the ordinary course and in accordance with applicable Law, and
(B) administer all Pre-Closing Vanliner Policies and Post-Closing Bound
Policies in good faith and in a manner, scope and at a service level
substantially consistent with those utilized by Acquiror in providing
administration with respect to insurance policies issued by Acquiror,
including with respect to administering, investigating and paying,
if appropriate, claims under Vanliner insurance policies and contracts, which
standards of service shall be consistent with standards of service generally
accepted in the property and casualty insurance industry;

 

(iii) any action taken, or any failure to take any action, by Acquiror or the
Companies (A) the purpose of which is to improperly and in bad faith reduce
or increase the amount of any calculation required by _Section 2.06_ or
_Section 2.07_ or (B) with the intent of improperly and in bad faith changing
the amount of any line item on any statement required by _Section 2.06_ or
_Section 2.07_ or any calculation required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section
2.07_, in each case, in favor of Acquiror;

 

(iv) any action taken, or any failure to take any action, by Acquiror or the
Companies with respect to any accounting, books, records, policies or
procedures on which any statement, settlement or proposal required by _Section
2.06_ or _Section 2.07_ or any payment amount required by _Section 2.06_ or
_Section 2.07_ are to be based the purpose of which is to impede or delay
(A) the determination of any such statement, settlement,

 



 

12  proposal or amount or (B) the preparation of any such statement, settlement
or proposal, in each case, in the manner and utilizing the methods
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(v) the effects of any reinsurance agreement, treaty or similar arrangement
(i) entered into or (ii) amended, terminated, modified, recaptured or
otherwise altered, in each case, by any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing Date;

 

(vi) any Losses that are or have been the subject of an indemnification claim
made by Acquiror pursuant to  _Article X_ , without regard to whether such
indemnification claim, as finally determined in accordance with _Article X_ ,
resulted in any payment by Seller under _Article X_ ; and

 

(vii) any Post-Closing Extra-Contractual Liabilities.

 

(k) Acquiror agrees that, until the Final Settlement Date, Acquiror shall (A)
promptly notify Seller in writing upon the occurrence of any event or series
of events which would reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially
changing the amount of (i) any line item on any statement, settlement or
proposal required by _Section 2.06_ or  _Section 2.07_ or (ii) any payment
required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_, (B) maintain proper books of
record and account in which full, true and correct entries are made of all of
the Companies dealings and transactions in relation to the Business as it
relates to the Pre-Closing Vanliner Policies and the Post-Closing Bound
Policies separate and apart from the books of record and account relating to
any other business of the Companies and (C) within sixty (60) days following
the end of each calendar quarter following the determination of the Final
Balance Sheet, deliver to Seller the Quarterly Balance Sheet as of the end of
such calendar quarter.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything else in this _Section 2.06_, in no event shall
the aggregate amount of payments by Seller pursuant to this _Section 2.06_
and _Section 2.07_ exceed 100% of the Closing Payment, as adjusted pursuant
to _Section 2.05_.

 

(m) The parties agree that all amounts actually paid (for the avoidance of
doubt, such amounts having been determined after giving effect to any Taxes
actually incurred, or any Tax savings actually derived, by Acquiror, as
provided in this _Section 2.06_) pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ shall be
treated for all tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. The
parties agree that for purposes of this _Section 2.06_, the amount of "Taxes
actually incurred" and "Tax savings actually derived" by Acquiror shall be
determined by multiplying the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount
calculated as of the second Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Year or the Balance
Sheet Guaranty True-Up Difference Amount, as applicable, by an assumed
combined tax rate equal to (i) the highest marginal tax rate set forth in
Section 11(b) of the Code for the applicable taxable year plus (ii) one
percent (1%); provided that any deferred tax benefits included in the Balance
Sheet Guaranty True-Up Amount calculated as of the second Balance Sheet
Guaranty True-Up Year or the Balance Sheet Guaranty True-Up Difference
Amount, as applicable, shall not be included in such calculation.

(a) By no later than March 31, 2014, Acquiror shall prepare and deliver to
Seller: 

(i) the Post-Closing Financial Statements as of December 31, 2013;

 

(ii) (A) an adjusted Final Balance Sheet updated by Acquiror to reflect (x)
the actual amounts paid, received or adjusted by the Companies during the
period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2013 with respect to the
line items entitled "Reinsurance Receivable on Paid Losses", "Reinsurance
Receivable on Reserves" and "Reserves (other than Reserves for Unallocated

resetting of the Total Combined Reserves, and (y) the amounts set forth on the
Final Annual Reconciliation with respect to the third Balance Sheet Guaranty
True-Up Year for all Other Line Items on the balance sheet not included in
clause (x) above (collectively, the " _2013 Reconciliation_ ") and (B) a
statement setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation, as of December 31,
2013, of (1) the Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Amount (the " _2013
Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation_ "), (2) the amount of
Unrecorded Liabilities (the " _2013 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation_ "),
(3) the amount of Contingent Assets (the " _2013 Contingent Assets
Calculation_ ") and (4) the 2013 Guaranty True-Up Amount substantially in
the form set forth in _Exhibit I_ , in each case, prepared in good faith and
in accordance with (I) the Accounting Principles, (II) the Settlement
Methodology and (III) _Section 2.06(j)_;

 

(iii) a proposal for the early settlement of any Final Settlement Difference
Amount that would otherwise be payable pursuant to _Section 2.07(q)_ (such
statement, the " _Early Settlement Proposal_ "). The Early Settlement Proposal
shall set forth a specific dollar amount to be paid either (x) by Acquiror to
Seller or (y) by Seller to Acquiror, in each case, in full satisfaction of
any future Final Settlement Difference Amount (such proposed payment, the "
_Proposed Early Settlement Payment_ "); and

 

(iv) a written certification of the Chief Financial Officer of each of
Acquiror and Vanliner that such 2013 Reconciliation and Acquirors
calculation of the 2013 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation, the
2013 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation, the 2013 Contingent Assets
Calculation and the 2013 Guaranty True-Up Amount were calculated in good
faith and in accordance with the Accounting Principles, the Settlement
Methodology, _Section 2.06(j)_ and this _Section 2.07_ (the materials
described in (i) through (iv), the " _Settlement Materials_ ").

(b) During the sixty (60) days immediately following Sellers receipt of
the Settlement Materials (the " _Settlement Materials Review Period_ "),
Seller and its Representatives will be permitted to review the audited
statutory financial statements of Vanliner, the related stand-alone work
papers (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to remove information
not relating to such Settlement Materials) of Acquiror and Acquirors
actuaries and independent accountants, and the Companies books, records and
other relevant financial information, in each case, relating to such
Settlement Materials, and Acquiror will make reasonably available the



 

14  individuals then in its employ, or in the employ of the Companies,
responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation of, such Settlement Materials in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquirors
actuaries and independent accountants will not be obligated to make any work
papers available to Seller unless and until Seller has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such actuaries and independent accountants.

 

(c) _2013 Notice of Disagreement_. Seller will notify Acquiror in writing (the
" _2013 Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Settlement
Materials Review Period, if Seller disagrees with the 2013 Reconciliation or
the calculation of the 2013 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation,
the 2013 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation or the 2013 Contingent Assets
Calculation. The 2013 Notice of Disagreement will set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and Sellers
determination of such disputed amounts. If no 2013 Notice of Disagreement is
delivered by Seller prior to the expiration of the Settlement Materials Review
Period, then the 2013 Reconciliation, the 2013 Uncollectible Reinsurance
Receivables Calculation, the 2013 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation and the
2013 Contingent Assets Calculation will be deemed to have been accepted by
Seller and will become final and binding upon the parties.

 

(d) _Resolution_. During the twenty (20) days immediately following the
delivery of the 2013 Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Acquiror will seek in
good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the 2013 Notice of Disagreement.

 

(e) _Engagement of 2013 Independent Expert_. If, at the end of the twenty (20)
day period described in  _Section 2.07(d)_, Seller and Acquiror have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the 2013 Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and Acquiror
will submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the 2013
Notice of Disagreement (along with copies of the 2013 Reconciliation, the 2013
Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation, the 2013 Unrecorded
Liabilities Calculation and the 2013 Contingent Assets Calculation marked to
indicate those line items that are in dispute) to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.07(e)_, the " _2013 Independent
Expert_ "). In the event that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP refuses or is
otherwise unable to act as the 2013 Independent Expert, the parties shall
cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting
firm with actuarial expertise in the United States of national recognition
mutually agreeable to the parties, in which event "2013 Independent Expert"
shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such
matters to the 2013 Independent Expert, or as soon as practicable thereafter,
the 2013 Independent Expert will make a final determination, binding on the
parties to this Agreement and their respective Affiliates and Representatives,
of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in the 2013 Reconciliation
and the calculation of the 2013 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables
Calculation, the 2013 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation and the 2013
Contingent Assets Calculation as to which Seller and Acquiror disagree as set
out in the 2013 Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each disputed line
item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either
Seller or Acquiror, shall not be more favorable to Seller than the amounts
advocated by Seller in the 2013 Notice of Disagreement or more favorable
to Acquiror



 

15  than the amounts advocated by Acquiror in the 2013 Reconciliation or
Acquirors calculation of the 2013 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables
Calculation, the 2013 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation and the 2013
Contingent Assets Calculation with respect to such disputed line item. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) the 2013 Independent Experts review of the 2013
Reconciliation shall be limited to a determination of whether such document
was prepared in accordance with _Section 2.06_ and this _Section 2.07_, (ii)
the 2013 Independent Experts review of the 2013 Unrecorded Liabilities
Calculation, the 2013 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation and
the 2013 Contingent Assets Calculation shall be limited to a determination of
whether such calculations were prepared in accordance with _Section 2.06_ and
this _Section 2.07_ and (iii) the 2013 Independent Expert shall not review
any line items or make any determination with respect to any matters not
subject to a dispute in the 2013 Notice of Disagreement. The determination of
the adjusted Final Balance Sheet and the calculation of the 2013
Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation, the 2013 Unrecorded
Liabilities Calculation and the 2013 Contingent Assets Calculation that are
final and binding on the parties with respect to December 31, 2013, as
determined either through (x) failure to timely deliver a notice of
disagreement pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_, (y) agreement of the parties
pursuant to _Section 2.07(d)_ or (z) through the action of the 2013
Independent Expert pursuant to this _Section 2.07(e)_, are referred to as
the " _Final 2013 Reconciliation_ ", the " _Final 2013 Uncollectible
Reinsurance Receivables Calculation_ ", the " _Final 2013 Unrecorded
Liabilities Calculation_ " and the " _Final 2013 Contingent Assets
Calculation_ ".

(f) The cost of the 2013 Independent Experts review and determination shall
be shared equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand.
During the review by the 2013 Independent Expert, Acquiror and Seller will
each make available to the 2013 Independent Expert interviews with such
individuals, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may
be reasonably required by the 2013 Independent Expert to fulfill their
obligations under _Section 2.07(e)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
actuaries and independent accountants of Seller or Acquiror will not be
obligated to make any work papers available to a 2013 Independent Expert
unless and until such firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
actuaries or accountants, as applicable.

 

(g) _Calculation of 2013 Guaranty True-Up Amount_. The " _2013 Guaranty True-
Up Amount_ " will be an amount calculated in accordance with this _Section
2.07(g)_. The " _2013 Guaranty True-Up Amount_ " will be calculated as
follows:

 

(i) the Closing Date Net Reserves Amount;

 

(ii) __plus__ the Closing Date Net Unearned Premium Runoff Amount;

at the Escrow Rate calculated and payable in accordance with _Section 2.10_;
_provided_ that, if the amount owing to Acquiror pursuant to this _Section

the Final Settlement Materials, and Acquiror will make reasonably available
the individuals then in its employ, or in the employ of the Companies,
responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation of, such Final Settlement Materials in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquirors
actuaries and independent accountants will not be obligated to make any work
papers available to Seller unless and until Seller has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such actuaries and independent accountants.

 

(l) Seller will notify Acquiror in writing (the " _Final Settlement Notice of
Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Final Settlement Review
Period if Seller disagrees with the 2014 Proposed Final Settlement
Reconciliation or Acquirors calculation of the 2014 Uncollectible Reinsurance
Receivables Calculation, 2014 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation, the 2014
Contingent Assets Calculation or the Proposed Final Settlement Payment. The
Final Settlement Notice of Disagreement will set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and Sellers determination
of such disputed amounts, as applicable. If no Final Settlement Notice of
Disagreement is delivered by Seller prior to the expiration of the Final
Settlement Review Period, then the Proposed Final Settlement Payment will be
deemed to have been accepted by Seller and will become final and binding on
the parties, and the Proposed Final Settlement Amount will be the "Final
Settlement Amount" for purposes of _Section 2.07(p)_. In the event that a
Final Settlement Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller prior to the
expiration of the Final Settlement Review Period, if the difference between
Acquirors calculation of:

 

(i) the 2014 Net Reserves Amount reflected on the 2014 Proposed Final
Settlement Reconciliation and Sellers calculation of the 2014 Net Reserves
Amount set forth in the Final Settlement Notice of Disagreement is less than
or equal to ten percent (10%) of the larger of such calculations, then the
average of such calculations will be the "Final 2014 Net Reserves Amount" for
purposes of this _Section 2.07_;

(ii) the 2014 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Amount set forth in the
Final Settlement Materials and Sellers calculation of such amount set forth
in the Final Settlement Notice of Disagreement is less than or equal to ten
percent (10%) of the larger of such calculations, then the average of such
calculations will be the "Final Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables
Calculation" for purposes of this _Section 2.07_;

 

(iii) the 2014 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation set forth in the Final
Settlement Materials and Sellers calculation of such amount set forth in the
Final



 

21  Settlement Notice of Disagreement is less than or equal to ten percent (10%)
of the larger of such calculations, then the average of such calculations will
be the "Final Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation" for purposes of this
_Section 2.07_; and

(iv) the 2014 Contingent Assets Calculation set forth in the Final Settlement
Materials and Sellers calculation of such amount set forth in the Final
Settlement Notice of Disagreement is less than or equal to ten percent (10%)
of the larger of such calculations, then the average of such calculations
will be the "Final Contingent Assets Calculation" for purposes of this
_Section 2.07_.

 

(m) If the difference between Acquirors calculation of any of the amounts
described in  _Section 2.07(l)(i)-(iv)_ and Sellers calculation of such
amounts is greater than ten percent (10%) of the larger of such calculations,
then, during the twenty (20) days immediately following the delivery of the
Final Settlement Notice of Disagreement (the " _Final Settlement Consultation
Period_ "), Seller and Acquiror will seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to such calculations. If Seller
and Acquiror are unable to resolve such differences prior to the expiration
of the Final Settlement Consultation Period, then Acquirors calculations (as
set forth in the Final Settlement Materials) of the applicable amounts that
remain in dispute and Sellers calculations (as set forth in the Final
Settlement Notice of Disagreement) of the applicable amounts that remain in
dispute will be submitted, no later than one (1) Business Day following the
expiration of the Final Settlement Consultation Period, to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.07(m)_,
the " _Final Settlement Independent Expert_ ") to resolve such disputes. In
the event that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to
act as the Final Settlement Independent Expert, the parties shall cooperate in
good faith to appoint an independent actuarial firm in the United States of
national recognition mutually agreeable to the parties, in which event "Final
Settlement Independent Expert" shall mean such firm. Neither Seller nor
Acquiror shall use PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its independent actuary for
purposes of preparing the calculation required by this  _Section 2.07(m)_.

(n) The Final Settlement Independent Expert shall, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the notice described in _Section 2.07(m)_, or as soon
as practicable thereafter, in accordance with this _Section 2.07(n)_, render
a final determination, as applicable, of:

 

(i) the 2014 Net Reserves Amount by selecting the determination of such amount
submitted by either Seller or Acquiror which, ivn the judgment of the Final
Settlement Independent Expert, most accurately reflects the amount of the 2014
Net Reserves Amount as calculated in accordance with the Accounting
Principles, the Settlement Methodology and  _Section 2.06(j)_;

(ii) the 2014 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation by selecting
the determination of such amount submitted by either Seller or Acquiror which,
in the judgment of the Final Settlement Independent Expert, most accurately
reflects the 2014 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation as
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles, the Settlement
Methodology and _Section 2.06(j)_;



 

22 (iii) the 2014 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation by selecting the
determination of such amount submitted by either Seller or Acquiror which, in
the judgment of the Final Settlement Independent Expert, most accurately
reflects the 2014 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation as calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, the Settlement Methodology and
_Section 2.06(j)_; and/or

 

(iv) the 2014 Contingent Assets Calculation by selecting the determination of
such amount submitted by either Seller or Acquiror which, in the judgment of
the Final Settlement Independent Expert, most accurately reflects the 2014
Contingent Assets Calculation as calculated in accordance with the Accounting
Principles, the Settlement Methodology and  _Section 2.06(j)_.

The Final Settlement Independent Expert shall have no power or authority to
select a determination of any amount described in _Section 2.07(n)(i)-(iv)_
other than an applicable amount submitted by Seller or Acquiror, and the
determination of such amounts selected by the Final Settlement Independent
Expert shall be final and binding on the parties. The calculation of the 2014
Net Reserves Amount, the 2014 Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables
Calculation, the 2014 Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation and the 2014
Contingent Assets Calculation that are final and binding on the parties, as
determined either through (A) the failure to timely deliver a Final Settlement
Notice of Disagreement pursuant to _Section 2.07(l)_, (B) agreement of the
parties pursuant to _Section 2.07(m)_, (C) the averaging of the applicable
amounts pursuant to _Section 2.07(l)_ or (D) the action of the Final
Settlement Independent Expert pursuant to this _Section 2.07(n)_, are
referred to as the " _Final 2014 Net Reserves Amount_ ", the " _Final
Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation_ ", the " _Final Unrecorded
Liabilities Calculation_ " and the " _Final Contingent Assets Calculation_ ",
respectively, and the date on which such amounts are determined is referred
to as the " _Final Settlement Amount Determination Date_ ".

 

(o) The cost of the Final Settlement Independent Experts review and
determination shall be shared equally by Seller, on the one hand, and
Acquiror, on the other hand. During the review by the Final Settlement
Independent Expert, Acquiror and Seller will each make available to the Final
Settlement Independent Expert interviews with such individuals, and such
information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably required
by the Final Settlement Independent Expert to fulfill its obligations under
_Section 2.07(n)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent actuaries
of Seller or Acquiror will not be obligated to make any work papers available
to the Final Settlement Independent Expert unless and until such firm has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such actuaries.

(p) _Calculation of Final Settlement Amount_. The " _Final Settlement Amount_
" will be an amount calculated in accordance with this _Section 2.07(p)_. The
" _Final Settlement Amount_ " will be calculated as follows:

 

(i) the Closing Date Net Reserves Amount;

 

(ii) __plus__ the Closing Date Net Unearned Premium Runoff Amount;

 



 

23 (iii) __plus__ the Net Unearned Premium Runoff from Post-Closing Bound
Policies as of December 31, 2014;

(iv) __minus__ the Final 2014 Net Reserves Amount;

(v) (A) __plus__ the 2012 Other Balance Sheet Account Difference Amount, if
such amount is positive, or (B) _ _minus__ the absolute value of the 2012
Other Balance Sheet Account Difference Amount, if such amount is negative;

 

(vi) (A) __minus__ the Final Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables
Calculation, if such amount is positive, or (B) _ _plus__ the absolute value
of the Final Uncollectible Reinsurance Receivables Calculation, if such amount
is negative;

 

(vii) __minus__ the Final Unrecorded Liabilities Calculation;

 

(viii) __plus__ the Final Contingent Assets Calculation.

 

(q) _Final Settlement Amount Payment and Final Release of Escrow Property_.

 

(i) If the Final Settlement Difference Amount is _a positive amount_ , then,
within two (2) Business Days after the Final Settlement Amount Determination
Date, (A) Acquiror will pay to Seller an amount equal to the Final Settlement
Difference Amount, decreased by any Taxes actually incurred, or increased by
any Tax savings actually derived, by Acquiror with respect to such Final
Settlement Difference Amount, together with interest thereon at the Escrow
Rate calculated and payable in accordance with _Section 2.10_, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Seller and (B) Acquiror and Seller will execute and deliver a joint
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly
release (in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) to Seller any remaining
Escrow Property which is held by the Escrow Agent.

within two (2) Business Days after the Final Settlement Amount Determination
Date, Acquiror and Seller shall deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly release (in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement) (A) to Acquiror Escrow Property in amount equal to the
absolute value of such Final Settlement Difference Amount, increased by any
Taxes actually incurred, or decreased by any Tax savings actually derived, by
Acquiror with respect to such Final Settlement Difference Amount, together
with interest thereon at the Escrow Rate calculated and payable in accordance
with _Section 2.10_; _provided_ , that, if the amount owing to Acquiror
pursuant to this _Section 2.07(q)(ii)_ exceeds the amount of the Escrow
Property, then Seller shall deliver to Acquiror an amount of cash equal to
such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Acquiror, and (B) to Seller any remaining Escrow
Property then on deposit in the Escrow Account (after giving effect to the
release described in (A) above).

 

(r) The parties agree that all amounts actually paid (for the avoidance of
doubt, such amounts having been determined after giving effect to any Taxes
actually incurred,



 

24  or any Tax savings actually derived, by Acquiror, as provided in this
_Section 2.07_) pursuant to this _Section 2.07_ shall be treated for all tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. The parties agree that for
purposes of this _Section 2.07_, the amount of "Taxes actually incurred" and
"Tax savings actually derived" by Acquiror shall be determined by multiplying
the 2013 Guaranty True-Up Difference Amount, the Agreed Early Settlement
Payment or the Final Settlement Difference Amount, as applicable, by an
assumed combined tax rate equal to (i) the highest marginal tax rate set forth
in Section 11(b) of the Code for the applicable taxable year plus (ii) one
percent (1%); provided that any deferred tax benefits included in the 2013
Guaranty True-Up Difference Amount, the Agreed Early Settlement Payment or the
Final Settlement Difference Amount, as applicable, shall not be included in
such calculation.

Acquiror shall pay to Seller the amount set forth on the Unearned Premium
Payment Schedule for such Unearned Premium Payment Period. The parties agree
that all payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.08_ shall be treated for
all tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

its Affiliates shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to any
Person unless and until such Person has signed a customary agreement relating
to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such auditors or accountants.

Section 5.03  _Books and Records_.

(a) Subject to _Sections 5.03(b)_ and _5.04(b)_ and except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller and its Affiliates shall have
the right to retain copies of all books and records of each of the Companies
and the Business relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
but all originals of such books and records shall be the property of the
Companies and shall be delivered or made available to Acquiror at the Closing.
Acquiror agrees that, with respect to all original books and records of each
of the Companies existing as of the Closing Date, it will (and will cause
each of the Companies to) (a) comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the preservation and retention of records and (b)
apply preservation and retention policies that are no less stringent than
those generally applied by Acquiror.



 

51 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall develop and implement a plan
that will result in the delivery or transfer of the books and records of the
Companies to Acquiror (or a Person designated by Acquiror) at, or as soon as
reasonably practicable following, the Closing in the manner (and in the case
of physical books and records of the Companies at the location(s)) reasonably
requested by Acquiror to the extent not located at an office of the Companies.
Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to separate any such books and records from any other
books and records of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies). To
the extent that Seller or its Affiliates are unable to separate any books and
records pursuant to the previous sentence (the " _Inseparable Books and
Records_ "), Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to physically
deliver the Inseparable Books and Records; _provided_ , _however_ , that, from
and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and its and such Affiliates respective Representatives to, afford Acquiror
and its Representatives the right to access (and copy) data from the
Inseparable Books and Records; _provided_ , _further_ , that any access to
(and copying of) such data shall be at Sellers cost and expense.

Section 5.04  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, dated June
26, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Acquiror and Fox-Pitt
Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller (USA) LLC (now known as Macquarie Capital (USA)
Inc.) are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in
full force and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If, for any
reason, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates on the one hand, and
Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Companies), on the other hand,
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, maintain in
confidence, and not use to the detriment of the other party (including for the
purposes of competing with the other party or its Affiliates), any written,
oral or other information relating to or obtained from the other party or its
Affiliates (including with respect to Acquiror following the Closing, the
Companies), except that the foregoing requirements of this _Section
5.04(b)_ shall not apply to the extent that (i) any such information is or
becomes generally available to the public other than (A) in the case of
Acquiror, as a result of disclosure by Seller, its Affiliates or any of its
Representatives and (B) in the case of Seller, as a result of disclosure by
Acquiror, any Company (after the Closing Date) or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) any such information is required by
applicable Law, Governmental Order or a Governmental Authority to be
disclosed after prior notice that has been given to Acquiror, (iii) any such
information is to be disclosed in connection with any Action, or (iv) any such
information was or becomes available to such party on a non-confidential
basis and from a source (other than a party to this Agreement or any Affiliate
or Representative of such party) that is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates
and Representatives having access to such information of such obligation of
confidentiality.



 

52 Section 5.05 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_. 

(a) Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, shall (i)
promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the
date hereof, make (or, in the case of Acquiror, cause an Affiliate of Acquiror
to make) all filings and notifications with, and use (or, in the case of
Acquiror, cause an Affiliate of Acquiror to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of, all Governmental Authorities that may be or
become necessary for their respective execution and delivery of, and
the performance of their respective obligations pursuant to, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements
and (ii) cooperate (or, in the case of Acquiror, cause an Affiliate of
Acquiror to cooperate) with the reasonable requests of each other in promptly
seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals.
None of Seller, Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any
action that they should be reasonably aware would have the effect of
delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required approvals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
_Section 5.05_ shall obligate Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror to take
or refrain from taking or to agree to take, or cause any of its Affiliates or
the Companies to take or refrain from taking or agree to take, any action or
to suffer to exist any condition, limitation, restriction or requirement
that, individually or in the aggregate, would result in, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, a Burdensome Condition. A " _Burdensome Condition_ "
shall mean: (i) a material negative effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of Acquiror and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Companies taken as a whole; (ii) a
negative effect on the business, assets, liabilities, properties or condition
(financial or otherwise) of any Affiliate of Acquiror (other than its
Subsidiaries), other than any filing fees or other costs and expenses that any
Affiliate of Acquiror (other than its Subsidiaries) may be required to incur
in order to comply with this  _Section 5.05_; (iii) any requirement to sell,
divest, operate in a specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or limit,
before or after the Closing Date, any material assets, liabilities, businesses
or operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
Companies, taken as a whole; or (iv) any requirement to sell, divest, operate
in a specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or limit, before or after
the Closing Date, any assets, liabilities, businesses or operations of any
Affiliate of Acquiror (other than its Subsidiaries).

(b) Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, each agree to
(i) make (or, in the case of Acquiror, cause an Affiliate of Acquiror to make)
an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each, an
" _Initial HSR Filing_ ") promptly after the date of this Agreement, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof, and to
supply (or, in the case of Acquiror, cause an Affiliate of Acquiror to
supply) promptly any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) promptly make (or, in the case
of Acquiror, cause an Affiliate of Acquiror to promptly make) any filing that
may be required under any other antitrust or competition Law or by any other
antitrust or competition authority. Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror or
an Affiliate of Acquiror, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for
its respective filing fees associated with the filings required under the HSR
Act and any other similar filings required in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

53 (c) Seller and Acquiror shall promptly notify one another of
any communication it or its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication (other
than its Initial HSR Filing) by such party to any Governmental Authority and
shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings (other
than its Initial HSR Filing) or communications between such party or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand. None of Seller, Acquiror or any
Affiliate of Acquiror shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or
other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and to  _Section 5.02(a)_, Seller, Acquiror and
their respective Affiliates will coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither party shall be required to disclose to
the other any of its or its Affiliates confidential competitive information.
Neither party shall be required to comply with any provision of this _Section
5.05(c)_ to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited by applicable
Law.

 

(d) Each of Seller and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by any
Transaction Agreement.

(e) Each of Seller and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any other consents and approvals (other than those addressed under
_Section 5.05(a)_ or _Section 5.15_) and make any other notifications that
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that, neither party shall be
required to compensate any third party, commence or participate in litigation
or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
party to obtain any such consent or approval.

Section 5.06 _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Companies shall cease to be insured
by insurance policies issued to Seller or its Affiliates (other than
insurance policies issued to any Company) or by any of Sellers or its
Affiliates self-insurance programs to the extent such insurance policies or
programs cover the Companies. With respect to events or circumstances
relating to the Companies that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
that are covered by occurrence-based third party liability insurance policies
and any workers compensation insurance policies and/or comparable workers
compensation self-insurance programs sponsored by Seller and/or its Affiliates
and that apply to the locations at which the businesses of the Companies
operate, Acquiror and the Companies may make claims under such policies
and programs; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror agrees to consult in
good faith with Seller prior to making any such claims and discuss with Seller
alternatives to making any such claims that are 



 

54  mutually beneficial to the parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither
Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall make any such claims if, and to the
extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies sponsored by
Acquiror and/or its Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Companies). As
of the second anniversary of this Agreement, Acquiror shall no longer have
access to such occurrence-based third party liability insurance policies or
to such workers compensation insurance policies and/or comparable workers
compensation self-insurance programs that apply to the locations at which the
businesses of the Companies operate and Acquiror shall assume full
responsibility for, and release Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) from, all liability for claims, known or unknown, resulting from
occurrences prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) With respect to any open claims against the insurance policies of Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies) relating to the Losses
suffered by the Companies prior to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to remit to
Acquiror any net proceeds realized from such claims, to the extent taken into
account as assets in the preparation of the Final Tangible Book Value, upon
full and final settlement of such claims; _provided_ that Acquiror complies
with the requirements specified in _Section 5.06(a)_.

 

Section 5.07 _Intercompany Obligations_. Except for the intercompany
obligations set forth in _Schedule 5.07_ , Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take such action and make such payments as may be necessary so
that, prior to or concurrently with the Closing, the Companies, on the one
hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other
hand, shall settle, discharge, offset, pay or repay in full all intercompany
loans, notes, and advances regardless of their maturity and all intercompany
receivables and payables for the amount due, including any accrued and unpaid
interest to but excluding the date of payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if each such item is not paid in full in cash, the method of discharge must be
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror.

 

Section 5.08 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Except (a) as otherwise contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements, (b) as set forth in _Schedule 5.08_ or (c) as
otherwise agreed by Seller and Acquiror, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate prior to or
concurrently with the Closing all Intercompany Agreements, after giving
effect to _Section 5.07_, such that none of the Companies has or will have
any liabilities or obligations under any Intercompany Agreement as of the
Closing Date.

 

Section 5.09 _No Solicitation of Business Employees_. For a period of thirty
(30) months from the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall not,
without the prior written consent of Acquiror, directly or indirectly, solicit
for employment or hire any then current employee, agent, broker, sales
representative or distributor of any of the Companies;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and its Affiliates may employ or hire any such Person
who is terminated or otherwise discharged by any of the Companies; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.09_ shall prohibit
Seller or any of its Affiliates from employing or hiring any Person who
contacts Seller or any of its Affiliates on his or her own initiative without
direct solicitation or as a result of a general solicitation to the public
or general advertising.

Section 5.10 _No Solicitation of Seller Employees_. For a period of
thirty (30) months from the Closing Date, Acquiror and its Affiliates
(including the Companies) shall



 

55  not, without the prior written consent of Seller, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment or hire any then current employee, agent, broker, sales
representative or distributor of Seller or any of its Affiliates; _provided_
, _however_ , that Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Companies) may
employ or hire any such Person who is terminated or otherwise discharged by
Seller or any of its Affiliates; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that nothing
in this _Section 5.10_ shall prohibit Acquiror and its Affiliates (including
the Companies) from employing or hiring any Person who contacts the Acquiror
and its Affiliates (including the Companies) on his or her own initiative
without direct solicitation or as a result of a general solicitation to the
public or general advertising.

 

Section 5.11 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) Seller understands that Acquiror shall be entitled to protect and preserve
the going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and that Acquiror would not have entered into this Agreement absent the
provisions of this _Section 5.11_ and, therefore, subject to _Section
5.11(c)_, for a period of five (5) years from the Closing, Seller shall not,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage
in the business of writing or issuing, within the United States, (i)
commercial property and casualty insurance policies or contracts or workers
compensation insurance policies or contracts of the type written by Vanliner
as of the date hereof or the Closing Date, or (ii) any other commercial
property and casualty insurance policies or contracts or workers
compensation insurance policies or contracts (each, a " _Competing Business_
").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.11(a)_, and
without implication that the following activities otherwise would be subject
to the provisions of this _Section 5.11_, nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller from engaging, or require Seller to
cause any of its Affiliates not to engage, in any manner in any of the
following:

(i) acquiring (A) less than an aggregate of five percent (5%) of any class of
stock of a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in any Competing Business
or (B) a Person that engages, directly or indirectly, in any Competing
Business if such Competing Business accounts for less than ten percent (10%)
of such Persons consolidated annual revenues;

(ii) selling any of its assets or businesses to a Person engaged in any
Competing Business;

(iii) engaging in any activity that does not constitute the business of
insurance under applicable Law in the applicable jurisdiction;

 

(iv) engaging in Existing Business Activities; or

 

(v) engaging in any activity set forth in _Schedule 5.11(b)(v)_.

 

(c) The restrictions prohibiting Seller and its Affiliates from engaging in a
Competing Business included in  _Section 5.11(a)_ shall terminate with
regard to any line of commercial property and casualty insurance (including
commercial automobile insurance) or workers compensation insurance in the
event that such line of insurance is no longer offered or



 

56  sold to the Van Lines Agents by any of Vanliner, Acquiror or any their
respective Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude, prohibit or
restrict Seller from engaging, or require Seller to cause any of its
Affiliates not to engage, in any manner in the business of selling,
underwriting, marketing or administering any line of insurance policies, bonds
or contracts which line is no longer offered and sold by any of
Vanliner, Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates to Van Lines Agents
following the Closing.

Section 5.12  _Relief_. Seller and Acquiror, on behalf of themselves and
their respective Affiliates, agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
case of any breach of the covenants contained in _Sections 5.09_ , _5.10_ or
_5.11_. It is accordingly agreed that Seller or Acquiror, as applicable,
shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, including the
remedy of specific performance, to prevent any breach of _Sections 5.09_ ,
_5.10_ or _5.11_. 

Section 5.13 _Seller Intellectual Property; Trade Names and Trademarks_.
Except as provided in the Transaction Agreements:

(a) Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that
Acquiror is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title
or interest in and to any Intellectual Property owned by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Companies), including the name "UniGroup", "United
Vanlines", "Mayflower Transit", or any trade names, trademarks, Internet
domain names, tag-lines, identifying logos or service marks related thereto or
employing the words "UniGroup", "United Vanlines", "Mayflower Transit", or
any variation of the foregoing or any confusingly similar trade name,
trademark, Internet domain name, service mark or logo, or any trade names,
trademarks or Internet domain names set forth in _Schedule 5.13_ (including
all registrations and applications relating thereto) (collectively, the "
_Seller Names and Marks_ "), and, except as otherwise expressly provided in
this _Section 5.13_, neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall have any rights in the
Seller Names and Marks and neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall contest the ownership or
validity of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or to the Seller
Names and Marks.

(b) Acquiror agrees that, except as otherwise provided in this _Section
5.13_, following the Closing Date, Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the
Companies) shall cease and discontinue all uses of the Seller Names and Marks,
either alone or in combination with other words and all marks, trade dress,
logos, monograms and other source identifiers similar to any of the foregoing
or embodying any of the foregoing alone or in combination with other words.
Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Companies), agrees that the rights of the Companies to the
Seller Names and Marks pursuant to the terms of any trademark agreements shall
terminate on the Closing Date.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, or such additional period as
mutually agreed by the parties in writing, Acquiror and its Affiliates
(including the Companies) shall re-label, destroy or exhaust all materials
bearing the Seller Names and Marks, including signage,
advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory,
electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards, web sites,
and other materials, and make all filings with any office, agency or body to
effect the elimination of any use of the Seller Names and Marks from the



 

57  businesses of the Companies, so as to bring Acquiror and its Affiliates into
compliance with this _Section 5.13_; _provided_ that Acquiror shall commence
the removal of the Seller Names and Marks from all such materials promptly
following the Closing Date and shall promptly upon the Closing Date cease all
use of the Seller Names and Marks on all stationary, business cards, purchase
orders, invoices, and similar correspondence. Acquiror, for itself and its
Affiliates, agrees that use of the Seller Names and Marks during the period
authorized by this _Section 5.13_ shall be only with respect to goods and
services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods
and services with respect to which the Companies used the Seller Names and
Marks prior to Closing. Acquiror shall take all necessary action to ensure
that other users of the Seller Names and Marks, whose rights terminate upon
the Closing pursuant to this _Section 5.13_, shall cease use of the Seller
Names and Marks, except as expressly authorized thereafter by Seller.
Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the Closing
Date Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Companies) will not
expressly, or by implication, do business as or represent themselves as Seller
or its Affiliates.

 

(d) In the event Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror (including the
Companies) violates any of its obligations under this _Section 5.13_, Seller
and its Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages
or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Acquiror acknowledges that a
violation of this _Section 5.13_ may cause Seller and its Affiliates
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages.
Acquiror therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened
violation of this _Section 5.13_, Seller and its Affiliates shall be
entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to a temporary
restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against
Acquiror or such Affiliate of Acquiror to prevent any violations of this 
_Section 5.13_, without the necessity of posting a bond.

Section 5.14 _Transaction Agreements_. The parties have agreed to the forms
of agreements attached as _Exhibits C_ , _D_ , _E_ and _G_ in relation to the
Escrow Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Affinity Agreement
and the Trademark License Agreement, respectively, and the terms of the Lease
Agreement set forth in _Exhibit F_ , and shall, at or prior to the Closing,
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, each such
agreement.

 

Section 5.15 _Restructuring Plan_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, but subject to Acquirors rights pursuant to _Section
8.02(e)_, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary to effect and carry out the
restructuring plan set forth in _Schedule 5.15_  (collectively, as amended in
accordance with this _Section 5.15_, the " _Restructuring Plan_ ") at or
prior to the Closing. The parties agree that the Restructuring Plan may be
amended at any time prior to the Closing to the extent necessary to obtain
any consent or approval set forth in _Schedule 3.05_ , _provided_ that Seller
provides Acquiror with prior written notice of any such amendment and any such
amendments are not, individually or in the aggregate, materially detrimental
to Acquiror or the Companies; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no
amendment involving any reduction in the amount of any cash dividend to be
made by any Company which is included in the Restructuring Plan shall be
deemed to be materially detrimental to Acquiror or the Companies. At the
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Acquiror the agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates reasonably acceptable to Acquiror evidencing such
actions, including a lease agreement by and between Seller and Vanliner upon
the terms set forth in _Exhibit F_ (the " _Lease Agreement_ "). Following

 



 

58  the date hereof, Seller and Acquiror agree to cooperate and negotiate in
good faith the final form of Lease Agreement to be entered into between Seller
and Vanliner at Closing. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any consents and approvals and make any
notifications that may be required in connection with the Restructuring Plan.
In the event that Seller and Acquiror mutually agree to pay any compensation
to any third party in connection with the sale, conveyance, assignment,
transfer or delivery of any Other IT Asset in connection with the
Restructuring Plan, (i) Seller shall be responsible for the first $50,000 of
such payments (in the aggregate) and (ii) any such payments in excess of
$50,000 (in the aggregate) will be shared equally by Seller and Acquiror;
_provided_ that the aggregate liability of __each of__ Seller and Acquiror
pursuant to this sentence shall in no event exceed $500,000. Subject to
Acquirors rights pursuant to _Section 8.02(e)_, if, on the Closing Date, any
such consent or approval is not obtained, or if an attempted transfer or
assignment of assets in connection with the Restructuring Plan would be
ineffective or a violation of Law or would adversely affect the rights of the
Companies (as assignees of Seller) thereto or thereunder so that the Companies
would not in fact receive all such rights, then Seller and Acquiror will,
subject to _Section 5.05(e)_, cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement
under which the Companies would, in compliance with Law, obtain the benefits
and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with such
assets in accordance with this Agreement, including subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to the Companies, or under which Seller would
enforce for the benefit (and at the expense) of the Companies any and all
of its rights against a third party (including any Governmental Authority)
associated with such assets, and Seller would promptly pay to the Companies
when received all monies received by it under any such assets, and Acquiror
would, or would cause the Companies to, promptly pay to Seller all amounts
due by the Companies under any such assets.

Section 5.16  _D andO Liabilities_. From and after the Closing Date, Acquiror
shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, take any steps that would
reasonably be expected to affect adversely the rights of any individual who
served as a director or officer of any of the Companies at any time prior to
the Closing Date (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") to be indemnified,
under applicable Law or the organizational documents of the applicable Company
as they existed prior to the Closing Date, against any Losses, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and relating to
the fact that such DandO Indemnified Person was a director or officer of a
Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.17 _Acquisition Proposals_. From and after the date hereof and up to
and including the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
9.01_, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, Seller will not, nor
will Seller authorize or permit any of its Representatives or Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate (including by way of furnishing
information) or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any Person, or engage in any discussion
or negotiations relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal. As used
herein, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a proposal or offer (other than
pursuant to this Agreement) for a tender or exchange offer,
merger, consolidation, recapitalization or other business combination
involving any proposal to acquire, in any manner, an equity interest in the
any of the Companies, or to purchase a substantial portion of any 



 

59  Companys assets. Seller will promptly notify Acquiror in writing in the
event Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies) receives an
Acquisition Proposal, together with a copy of any agreements, correspondence
or other documents relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

Section 5.18  _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of
itself, its Affiliates (other than the Companies) and their respective
successors and assigns (each a " _Releasor_ "), hereby releases, waives and
forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Acquiror, each
Company and each of their respective officers, directors and employees of,
from and against any and all rights, claims and causes of action which such
Releasor ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause
or thing whatsoever occurring prior to the Closing Date, except with respect
to or in connection with (a) matters which Seller is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or (b) obligations of Acquiror
under this Agreement, including the payment to Seller of any amounts required
by _Sections 2.06_ , _2.07_ or _2.08_ , or any other Transaction Agreement.

 

Section 5.19 _Further Action_.

 

(a) Seller and Acquiror (i) shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be
executed and delivered, such documents and other papers and shall take, or
shall cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) shall refrain
from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
impede the Closing, (iii) without limiting the foregoing, shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause all the conditions to the
obligations of the other party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be met as soon as reasonably practicable, (iv) prior to and
after the Closing, shall cooperate in good faith in connection with meetings
and communications with customers, distribution channels and employees of the
Companies and (v) shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate an orderly
Closing and transition.

 

(b) Each of Seller and Acquiror shall keep each other reasonably apprised of
the status of the matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including with respect to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_. From time to time following the

consecutive calendar quarters, as indicated in two (2) consecutive Tangible

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 6.01 _Employment of all Employees_.

 

(a) Attached as _Schedule 6.01(a)(i)_ is a list of certain employees of Seller
whose employment duties and responsibilities are primarily devoted to the
operation of the Business (referred to herein as " _Support Employee_ " or "
_Support Employees_ "), and attached as _Schedule 6.01(a)(ii)_ is a list of
all employees of Seller whose employment duties and responsibilities are
solely devoted to the operation of the Business (referred to herein as "
_Business Employee_ " or " _Business Employees_ ", and, collectively with the
Support Employees, the " _Employees_ ", and any Business Employee or Support
Employee, individually, an " _Employee_ ").

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall make
available to Acquiror the job performance, attendance, disciplinary and other
employment records of each Employee as may be reasonably requested by
Acquiror. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Acquiror shall offer Comparable Employment (as described in this  _Article
VI_ ) to at least one hundred thirty (130) Business Employees, and may offer
employment, which offers shall be of Comparable Employment, to any of the
Support Employees, in each case, which Comparable Employment shall be with
one of the Companies effective as of the Closing Date. Subject to the
requirements of the immediately preceding sentence, Acquiror, in its sole
discretion, shall identify which Employees will be offered Comparable
Employment. Those Employees who are offered Comparable Employment and who
accept such Comparable Employment are referred to herein as (i) if such
Employee is a Business Employee, a " _Transferred Business Employee_ " or "
_Transferred Business Employees_ " or (ii) if such Employee is a Support
Employee, a " _Transferred Support Employee_ " or " _Transferred_

 



 

62   _Support Employees_ " (the Transferred Business Employees and the
Transferred Support Employees are referred to herein collectively as "
_Transferred Employees_ " or individually as a " _Transferred Employee_ ").
Employees who are not offered Comparable Employment or who decline such offer
of Comparable Employment shall remain as employees of Seller on an at-will
basis according to applicable Law. Acquiror shall not be obligated to
continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any specific period of time
following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law. Subject to _Section
6.01(c)_, Acquiror shall be responsible for all salaries, wages, benefits and
other remuneration to the Transferred Employees that are earned or accrued
with respect to periods after the Closing Date and Seller shall have no
employment relationship with the Transferred Employees after the Closing Date
and no obligations to the Transferred Employees that arise with respect to
periods after the Closing Date.

 

(c) No later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, (i) Acquiror may
provide notice to Seller in writing identifying (A) any Transferred Support
Employee (the " _Identified Support Employees_ ") and (B) any Transferred
Business Employee (the " _Identified Business Employees_ ", and collectively
with the Identified Support Employees, the " _Identified Employees_ ") with
respect to whom Acquiror expects to terminate the employment relationship
within one hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing Date and (ii) Seller
may provide notice to Acquiror in writing identifying any Business Employees
that were not offered Comparable Employment with respect to whom Seller
expects to terminate the employment relationship within one hundred fifty
(150) days following the Closing Date (the " _Seller Identified Employees_
"). Acquiror and Seller hereby agree that each Identified Employee, and each
Seller Identified Employee, who is actually terminated within one hundred
fifty (150) days following the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive
Severance Benefits; _provided_ , that such Identified Employee or such Seller
Identified Employee, is otherwise eligible for severance benefits. Severance
Benefits for the Indentified Employees shall be subject to substantially
similar terms and conditions for eligibility of severance benefits had the
Identified Employee been employed by Seller as of the termination of
employment, including execution of a release of the Identified
Employees employer and Seller and its Affiliates. If an Identified Employee
is terminated within 150 days of the Closing Date but after the expiration of
the UniGroup, Inc. Special One-Time April 2010 Severance Plan, however, such
Identified Employee shall not be considered ineligible for Severance Benefits
solely due to the date of such termination of employment. Acquiror shall
reimburse Seller for twenty-five percent (25%) of the Severance Benefits paid
to any Seller Identified Employee who is terminated by Seller within one
hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing Date and is otherwise eligible
for Severance Benefits upon separation of employment. Subject to the following
sentence, Seller shall reimburse Acquiror for (x) one hundred percent (100%)
of the Severance Benefits paid to any Identified Support Employee and (y)
seventy-five percent (75%) of the Severance Benefits paid to any Identified
Business Employee, in each case, who is terminated within one hundred fifty
(150) days following the Closing Date and is otherwise eligible for Severance
Benefits upon separation of employment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in the event that the number of Transferred Business Employees is
reduced below one hundred thirty (130) for any reason, Seller shall have no
obligation to reimburse Acquiror for any Severance Benefits for any Identified
Business Employee that is terminated to the extent that the number of
Transferred Business Employees is reduced below one hundred thirty (130).
Seller may provide the Seller Identified Employees with severance benefits in
excess of the Severance Benefits, and may provide additional service credit
to Seller Identified Employees, but Acquirors reimbursement



 

63  obligation shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Severance
Benefits with respect to such Seller Identified Employees. Acquiror may
provide the Identified Employees with severance benefits in excess of the
Severance Benefits, and may provide additional service credit to the
Identified Employees, but Sellers reimbursement obligation shall not exceed
(A) one hundred percent (100%) of the Severance Benefits with respect to the
Identified Support Employees or (B) seventy-five percent (75%) of the
Severance Benefits with respect to the Identified Business Employees.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.01(c)_ to the contrary, in
no event shall Acquiror be responsible for any amount of Severance Benefits
for any Employee in excess of (x) a Severance Payment based on twenty (20)
weeks of Salary (as "Salary" is defined in the UniGroup, Inc. Special One-
Time April 2010 Severance Plan, or (y) the Supplemental Payment as set forth
in Section III(B) of the UniGroup, Inc. Special One-Time April 2010 Severance
Plan.

 

(d) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, effective as of the
Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall be entitled to receive at least
the same cash base salary and wages as were provided by Seller and its
Affiliates to such Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (referred to
herein as " _Comparable Employment_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time and from time to time after January 1, 2011 Acquiror may, in its sole
discretion, adjust cash base salary and wages at such times and at such
intervals as Acquiror may determine.

 

(e) Seller shall retain responsibility for and shall indemnify Acquiror
against any and all obligations to Transferred Employees arising under or
pursuant to any change in control or other similar arrangement, the payment of
which is triggered as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Transaction Agreement. Bonus or other incentive compensation
that vests during the 2009 calendar year will be paid to the Transferred
Employees by Seller in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement and company practice. Seller shall retain responsibility for and
shall indemnify Acquiror against any and all obligations or Liabilities to
Transferred Employees under any other non-qualified deferred compensation
plans set forth on _Schedule 3.15(m)_.

 

(f) Effective as of the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, assume all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates for all
accrued, unused paid time off of the Transferred Employees to the extent such
accrual is reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet; _provided_ that
if, at any time following the Closing, Acquiror eliminates any such accrued,
unused paid time off, Acquiror shall promptly reimburse Seller for the amount
of the applicable accruals so reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet.

 

(g) Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit the Transferred
Employees for service earned with Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Companies), or any of their respective predecessors, as of the Closing Date,
in addition to service earned with Acquiror and its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date, to the extent that service is relevant for purposes of (i)
eligibility or vesting of benefits under any employee benefit plan of Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates for which a Transferred Employee is otherwise
eligible and (ii) the calculation of paid time off, severance, layoff
and similar benefits.



 

64 (h) Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, waive limitations
on benefits under its group health plans relating to any pre-existing
conditions of the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents to the
extent such limitations were satisfied under Benefits Plans prior to the
Closing. Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under their group
health plans applicable to the Transferred Employees, deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by the Transferred Employees and their respective
dependents under Sellers or any of its Affiliates group health plans in the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, as applicable. For purposes of
this _Section 6.01_, Seller shall cause its group health plan to cooperate
in providing relevant data to Acquirors group health plan and Seller and
Acquiror shall cause their group health plan vendors to execute any
documentation required by the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended in order to facilitate such transfer.

(i) Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to, permit
each Transferred Employee who has one or more outstanding loans under a
defined contribution plan maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates and
receives an "eligible rollover distribution" within the meaning of Section
402(c)(4) of the Code from such plan to elect to roll over such distribution,
including such outstanding plan loans, into a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan maintained by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates.  _Schedule
6.01(i)_ sets forth a true and accurate list of each Transferred Employee who
has an outstanding defined contribution plan loan, along with, as of the date
hereof, such Transferred Employees account balance, outstanding
loan balance, repayment schedule and remaining number of payments.

Section 6.02 _Plans_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.02_ or as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall
assume any obligations under or liabilities with respect to, or receive any
right or interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance,
administration or other contracts pertaining to any of the Benefit Plans.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Acquiror or one of its Affiliates
shall continue to have responsibility for all Company Benefit Plans as of the
Closing Date. Seller shall retain responsibility for and shall indemnify
Acquiror with respect to any Liability (other than routine claims for
benefits) related to any Company Benefit Plan arising from, or in connection
with, any action or inaction of Seller or any Company on or prior to the
Closing.

 

(b) Except as otherwise required by the terms of any such plan or applicable
Law, as of the Closing Date all Transferred Employees who are participating
in any Benefit Plans shall cease active participation in, and benefit accrual
under, such Benefit Plans. Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) shall retain the responsibility for payment of all
covered medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability claims or
expenses incurred by any Employee (including his or her eligible dependents
and beneficiaries) under the Benefit Plans on and prior to the Closing Date,
and neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall assume any liability
with respect to such claims. Acquiror shall remit to Seller all Employee
premiums due for medical and dental benefit coverage attributable to periods
prior to the Closing Date, but which, as of the Closing Date, had not been
collected and remitted to Seller.



 

65 (c) _Medical Plan Participation; COBRA_. Acquiror shall take all
action necessary to ensure that all Transferred Employees (and their eligible
dependents) who participated in any medical plan maintained by Seller or any
of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing shall be eligible to
participate in a medical plan maintained by Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates, effective as of the first day following the Closing Date.
Following the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
retain all obligations to provide continuation health care coverage in
accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of
ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") to all Persons who incur or incurred a qualifying event at
any time under any Employee Plans that occur on or before the Closing Date.
Following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to,
provide COBRA coverage to all Transferred Employees and their qualified
beneficiaries who incur a "qualifying event" in accordance with COBRA
under an employee benefit plan maintained by Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates at any time on or after the Closing Date. Acquiror shall indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates against any and all obligations or Liabilities to
Transferred Employees and their qualified beneficiaries for COBRA coverage
with respect to qualifying events occurring at any time after the Closing
Date.

 

(d) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. On the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer
to Acquiror all records pertaining to the 2010 health care spending accounts
and the 2010 dependent care spending accounts of the Transferred Employees
under the Sellers Flexible Spending Account Plan (such accounts are referred
to hereinafter, collectively, as the " _FSAs_ "). Acquiror shall assume the
obligation to pay benefits under the FSAs for the remainder of the 2010
calendar year with respect to a Transferred Employees valid claims incurred
during 2010 that have not been paid on or before the Closing Date (solely to
the extent such Transferred Employee would be entitled to payment under the
terms of Acquirors Flexible Spending Account Plan). As soon as
administratively practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall make a cash
payment to Acquiror equal to the amount by which the aggregate salary
reductions (and other contributions) made for 2010 by Transferred Employees
under the FSAs on or before the Closing Date exceed the aggregate claims for
2010 paid to Transferred Employees under the FSAs on or before the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the aggregate salary
reductions (and other contributions) made for 2010 by Transferred Employees
under the FSAs on or before the Closing Date are exceeded by the aggregate
claims for 2010 paid to Transferred Employees under the FSAs on or before the
Closing Date (the " _FSA Deficit_ "), Acquiror shall make a cash payment as
soon as administratively practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, to Seller equal to the
FSA Deficit. All claims submitted by a Transferred Employee (other than those
that were previously paid by Seller on or prior to the Closing Date) shall be
governed by and subject to the terms of the Acquirors Flexible Spending
Account Plan. Within a reasonable period of time after the date hereof (and
in any event prior to the Closing Date), Seller shall provide to Acquiror
copies of the FSA elections for 2010 of all Transferred Employees and the
applicable enrollment forms. As soon as practicable, but in no event later
than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall provide
Acquiror with the calculations of the amount to be transferred or owed and
shall provide Acquirors administrator with copies of all 2010 claims already
reimbursed to Transferred Employees in 2010 prior to the Closing Date.



 

66 Section 6.03 _Cooperation and Assistance_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with Seller to provide such current information regarding the
Transferred Employees or former employees of the Business on an ongoing basis
as may be necessary to facilitate determinations of eligibility for, and
payments of benefits to, the Transferred Employees under the Employee Plans.

(b) Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, permit Transferred
Employees to provide such assistance to Seller as may be required in respect
of claims against Seller or its Affiliates, whether asserted or threatened, to
the extent that, in Sellers opinion, (i) a Transferred Employee has knowledge
of relevant facts or issues, or (ii) a Transferred Employees assistance is
reasonably necessary in respect of any such claim.

 

Section 6.04 _Employee and Other Data Protection_.

 

(a) Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and any third-party service
providers to, comply with all applicable Laws regarding the maintenance,
access, use, sharing, securing and disposal or other processing, of Seller
Personal Data and shall apply the same standard of care to Seller Personal
Data that it applies to personally identifiable information now in its
possession and control, including (i) compliance with any applicable
requirements to provide notice to, or obtain consent from, the data subject
for processing of the data after the Closing Date and (ii) taking any other
steps necessary to ensure compliance with applicable data protection Laws,
including the execution of any separate agreements with Seller or other
parties, as necessary or appropriate, to facilitate the lawful processing of
certain Seller Personal Data (such agreements to be executed before or after
the Closing Date, as necessary).

(b) Each of Acquiror and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates and any third-party service providers to, maintain, access, use,
share, dispose of or otherwise process Seller Personal Data only (i) to a
Person with a reasonable business purpose or, in the case of Acquiror,
pursuant to Sellers written instructions, in each case in the ordinary course
of business, (ii) as legally permitted and (iii) to the extent necessary to
perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreements. Acquiror shall use
reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards, to maintain the
security and confidentiality of Seller Personal Data designed to prevent,
among other things, accidental, unauthorized or unlawful
destruction, modification, disclosure, access or loss. Acquiror agrees that,
before the Closing Date, it shall not disclose any Seller Personal Data to
third parties, including service providers, without the express written
consent of Seller or unless required by applicable Law; and Acquiror shall
require that any Affiliate, service provider or other third party that
receives, maintains, accesses, uses or disposes of, or otherwise processes,
Seller Personal Data, agrees in writing, in advance, to adhere to the
standards of security and confidentiality of this _Section 6.04_, and agrees
not to further share, transfer, permit access to or dispose of Seller Personal
Data without the advance, express written consent of Acquiror and
Seller. Acquiror shall promptly inform Seller of any breach of this security
and confidentiality undertaking (including any accidental, unauthorized or
unlawful destruction, modification, disclosure, access or loss of Seller
Personal Data) unless prohibited from doing so by Law. After the Closing
Date, Seller shall (x) not disclose any Seller Personal Data to third parties,
including service providers, without the prior written consent of Acquiror
or 



 

67  unless required by applicable Law and (y) require that any Affiliate,
service provider or other third party that receives, maintains, accesses, uses
or disposes of, or otherwise processes Seller Personal Data agree in writing
to adhere to the standards of security and confidentiality of this _Section
6.04 _and not further share, transfer, permit access to or dispose of Seller
Personal Data without the prior written consent of Acquiror. Seller shall
promptly inform Acquiror of any breach of this security and confidentiality
undertaking (including any accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction,
modification, disclosure, access or loss of Seller Personal Data) unless
prohibited from doing so by Law.

Section 6.05 _WARN Act_. Acquiror shall not, and shall ensure that its
Affiliates (including after the Closing Date, the Companies) do not, take any
action or make any omission after the Closing that, in whole or in part,
results in liability for Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the
Worker Adjustment and Restraining Notification Act or any similar state or
local laws. Acquiror shall indemnify the Seller for any and all liabilities
arising under the Worker Adjustment and Restraining Notification Act or any
similar state or local laws as a result of the termination of any of the
Transferred Employees.

Section 6.06 _No Third Party Rights of Plan Amendments_. Regardless of
anything else contain in this _Article VI_ , the parties do not intend for
this _Article VI_ to amend any employee benefit plans or arrangements or
create any rights or obligations except between the parties hereto. No
Employee or other current or former employee of Seller or Acquiror, or any of
their respective Affiliates, or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
other person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert
any claim hereunder.

by this Agreement, other than from a reduction in the Companies Category A,
B or C attributes described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(4)(i)(A)-(C) resulting from a reattribution election, pursuant to

requirements of



 

68  the proviso set forth in the second sentence of _Section 7.01(g)_;

_Article VII_ and (iii) Excluded Taxes. Except as otherwise provided herein,
Acquiror shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable
to any Post-Closing Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date. Acquiror
shall be entitled to any refund relating to any loss or credit carrybacks
from Post-Closing Taxable Periods to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods; _provided_
that any such loss or credit carrybacks are not included in computing any
payment amounts under _Section 2.06_ or  _Section 2.07_. Any such refunds
received by Seller or its Affiliates shall be promptly, and in any event
within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of such refund, paid over to
Acquiror.

 

(c) For purposes of _Sections 7.01(a)_ and _7.01(b)_ , whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Companies for a
Straddle Period, the determination of the



 

69  Taxes of the Companies for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing
Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of
two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date
and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing
Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Companies
for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
Companies were closed at the close of the Closing Date;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are
properly allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the
Closing Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or
period that is deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date, and (ii) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.01(c)_, property
taxes for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the two (2) taxable
periods on a daily basis.

(d) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit, claim,
assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any change after the Closing Date
in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount of Tax that
results in an increase in a Tax liability for which Seller is liable pursuant
to _Section 7.01(a)_, and such change results in or will result in a decrease
in the Tax liability of the Companies, Acquiror or any Affiliate or successor
of any thereof for any Post-Closing Taxable Period or for the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, if and to the extent that
the Companies, Acquiror or any Affiliate or successor of any thereof realizes
an actual Tax savings as a direct result of such change in a Post-
Closing Taxable Period or the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall promptly remit any such actual Tax
savings to Seller.

 

(e) Subject to _Section 7.01(a)(iii)_ regarding Taxes resulting from the
implementation of the Restructuring Plan, all transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration or similar Taxes, fees or charges applicable to, or
incurred in connection with, the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements shall be borne equally by Acquiror and Seller.

(f) All Tax sharing, Tax allocation and Tax indemnity agreements or
arrangement involving any Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date
and, after the Closing Date, no Company shall be bound thereby or have any
rights or liabilities thereunder.

 

(g) Seller shall timely make one or more elections under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-36(d)(6) to prevent any reduction in the Companies attributes
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(4)(i). Notwithstanding
the previous sentence, a reattribution election made by Seller pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B), in respect of the
Companies Category A, B or C attributes described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-36(d)(4)(i)(A)-(C), shall not be considered a breach of this
_Section 7.01(g)_,  _provided_ that (i) the tax benefits attributable to any
such Category A, B or C attributes are not included in computing the Final
Tangible Book Value or taken into account in computing any payment amount
required by  _Section 2.06_ or _2.07_ and (ii) the reattribution election
does not



 

70  result in the reduction in any of the Companies Category D attributes
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(4)(i)(D).

 

(h) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide Acquiror with a materially accurate computation of Vanliner
Groups tax basis in the Capital Stock of each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries, together with all supporting documentation. Seller shall make
available to Acquiror as reasonably requested those Persons responsible for
preparing such computations. In any case where the unified loss rules of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 require Seller to use Vanliner Groups
tax basis in the Capital Stock of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, Seller
shall use the tax basis amounts computed pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 7.01(h)_.

 

Section 7.02 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to the Companies for Pre-Closing Taxable
Periods (including Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Companies on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with Seller or any of
its Affiliates), and in each case Seller shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, and Acquiror shall timely file
or cause to be filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Companies for Straddle Periods and Acquiror in each case shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
With respect to the Tax Returns to be filed by Seller or Acquiror pursuant to
the preceding sentence: (i) except as required by applicable law, such Tax
Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and no
position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent
with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in
filing such Tax Returns (including any position which would have the effect of
accelerating income to periods for which Seller is liable or deferring
deductions to periods for which Acquiror is liable) and (ii) such Tax Returns
shall be submitted to the other party not later than twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is
within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date) for review and approval by the other
party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, but may in all cases
be withheld if such Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with clause
(i) of this sentence.

(b) Seller or Acquiror shall pay the other party for the Taxes for which
Seller or Acquiror, respectively, is liable pursuant to _Section 7.01_ but
which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party pursuant
to _Section 7.02(a)_ upon the written request of the party entitled to
payment, setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by Seller
or Acquiror, as the case may be, but in no event later than five (5) days
prior to the due date for paying such Taxes. 

(c) Except as required by applicable Law, none of Acquiror or any Affiliate of
Acquiror shall (or shall cause or permit the Companies to) amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with
respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Companies with
respect to (i) any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of
Seller, or (ii)

 



 

71  any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(d) Acquiror shall promptly cause the Companies to prepare and provide to
Seller a package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work
papers (the " _Tax Package_ ") required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare
and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to
_Section 7.02(a)_. The Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with
past practice, including past practice as to providing such information and as
to the method of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant
measure of income of the Companies. Acquiror shall cause the Tax Package to
be delivered to Seller within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, or
if a return is due within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, as
promptly as practicable following the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.03 _Contest Provisions_. Acquiror shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Acquiror, any of its Affiliates or the Companies of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for
which Seller may be liable pursuant to  _Section 7.01(a)_. Seller shall have
the sole right to represent each Companys interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods or
otherwise relating to Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to
_Section 7.01(a)_, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the
case of a Straddle Period, Seller shall be entitled to participate at its
expense in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in
whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and, with the written consent of
Acquiror, and at Sellers sole expense, may assume the entire control of such
audit or proceeding. None of Acquiror, any of its Affiliates or any Company
may settle any Tax claim for any Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant
to _Section 7.01(a)_, without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Seller.

Section 7.04 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Acquiror shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

 

(a) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section 7.02_;

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any of the Companies;

(c) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Companies;

 

(d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments of the Companies for taxable periods for which the
other may have a liability under _Section 7.01_;

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any such taxable period;

  

 

72 (f) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in _Section
7.01(e)_ (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

 

(g) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this  _Article VII_.

Section 7.05 _Other Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The indemnification provided for in this _Article VII_ shall be the sole
remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes and the provisions of _Article X_
shall not apply to such claims, except as expressly provided.

 

(b) Any claim for indemnity under this _Article VII_ may only be made at a
time within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax
statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including
all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive).

 

(c) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

against, and reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Party for, all Losses that
such Acquiror Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become
subject to, as a result of or in connection with:

 

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Seller at the Closing
(excluding Losses that have been taken into account in determining any payment
amount pursuant to _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_);

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Seller shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Acquiror Indemnified Party
against, or reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant
to _10.01(a)(i)_ (other than Losses arising solely as a result of the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
_Sections 3.01_ , _3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.22_ and _3.27_ , as to which this
_Section 10.01(b)_ shall not apply) (i) with respect to any claim (or series
of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from the
same underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of

10.01(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price
(other than in respect of Losses arising solely as a result of the inaccuracy
or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in _Sections 3.01_
, _3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.22_ and _3.27_ , for which such

 



 

76  indemnification obligation shall in no event exceed 100% of the Purchase

inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror in
_Section 4.01_, _4.02_ , or _4.09_ , as to which this _Section 10.02(b)_
shall not apply) (i) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims
arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances), unless such
claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts,
events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $20,000 (nor shall any
such item that does not meet the $20,000 threshold be applied to or
considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Seller
Indemnified Parties Losses for which Acquiror has responsibility under clause
(ii) below) and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified
Parties Losses exceeds $1,000,000, after which Acquiror shall be obligated
for all Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties that in the aggregate are in

77 Section 10.03 _Notification of Claims_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement or,
in the case of any Action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
material change in any line item to be reflected in any statement, settlement
or proposal required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_ or any payment
amount required by  _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_, Acquiror (each such
Person, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall promptly notify the party or
parties liable for such indemnification or, in the case of Actions that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material change in any line item to be
reflected in any statement, settlement or proposal required by _Section 2.06_
or _Section 2.07_ or any payment amount required by _Section 2.06_ or 
_Section 2.07_, Seller (each such Person, an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in
writing of any (i) pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party that
the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement or (ii) any pending or
threatened Action that would reasonably be expected to result in a material
change in any item to be reflected in any statement, settlement or proposal
required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_ or any payment amount required
by _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_ (any such claim or Action being a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this 
_Article X_ , _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that (i)
notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement (other than a Post-Closing Covenant) must be delivered
prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in
_Section 11.01_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
and (ii) notices for claims in respect of a breach of a PostClosing Covenant
must be delivered prior to the date that is six months after the last day of
the effective period of such PostClosing Covenant; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that if, prior to such applicable date, a party hereto shall have notified the
other party hereto in accordance with the requirements of this _Section
10.03(a)_ of a claim for indemnification under this _Article X_  (whether or
not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
_Article X_ notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date. For
the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.03(a)_ shall not require Acquiror
to provide Seller with prior written notice of any claim or demand relating to
any insurance policy written or issued by any of the Companies at any time,
whether prior to, on or after the Closing Date, other than with respect to
Actions that would reasonably be expected to result in a material change in
any line item to be reflected in any statement, settlement or proposal
required by _Section 2.06_ or  _Section 2.07_ or any payment amount
required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_, if the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with written notice that it is responsible for the full
amount of Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim, (i) with respect to any Third Party Claim in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under _Section 10.01(a)(ii)_ or _Section
10.02(a)(ii)_, the Indemnifying Party, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
claim, shall assume, or (ii) with respect to any other Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within ten
(10) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such claim, may assume, the
defense and control of



 

78  such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own
expense. The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to
defend such Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from
the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the preceding sentence. Seller or
Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized
to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified Party, _provided_
that (i) such settlement does not involve any finding or admission of
any violation of Law, (ii) the Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid
all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement (other than as contemplated by _Sections
10.01(b)_ or  _10.02(b)_ , (iii) such settlement does not encumber any of the
material assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or
condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified
Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business and (iv) the
Indemnifying Party obtains, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.

(c) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_ that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt of
such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article X_. If the Indemnifying Party does not
so notify the Indemnified Party that it disputes such liability, the claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively
deemed to be a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this _Article X_ ,
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.01(b)_ or _Section 10.02(b)_, as the case may be and if
applicable, the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand
or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion
of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim
(or such portion of such claim) becomes finally determined.

(d) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this _Article X_
for, and no statement, settlement or proposal contemplated by _Section 2.06_
or _Section 2.07_ or payment amount required by _Section 2.06_ or _Section
2.07_ shall take into account, any Losses arising out of or in connection
with any Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified
Party without the prior consent of such Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed. The parties agree that, for purposes of
this _Section 10.03(d)_, any failure of an Indemnifying Party to respond to a
settlement or compromise of a Third Party Claim proposed by the Indemnified
Party shall be considered to be an unreasonable delay in the consent of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party does not respond to such
settlement or compromise proposal (i) within twenty (20) Business Days
following delivery of such proposal by the Indemnified Party or (ii) prior to
an earlier date, as identified by the Indemnified Party in such proposal, in
the event a response is required by any Governmental Authority or any
Governmental Order in connection with such Third Party Claim, provided that
the Indemnifying Party has had a reasonable opportunity to review and evaluate
such proposal prior to such earlier date.



 

79 Section 10.04 _Payment_. An Action, and the liability for and amount of
damages therefor, shall be deemed to be " _finally determined_ " for purposes
of this _Article X_ when the parties to such Action have so determined by
mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final non-appealable Governmental
Order shall have been entered. In the event an Action for indemnification
under this _Article X_ shall have been finally determined, the amount of such
final determination shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, on demand
as follows:

(a) any such amount owed by Acquiror shall be paid to Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller;
and

(b) any such amount owed by Seller will be paid to Acquiror by delivery by
the Escrow Agent of Escrow Property in an amount equal to such amount owed,
and the parties shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days following the final determination of such Action, execute and deliver a
joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release
to Acquiror such Escrow Property in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ that, if the amount owing to Acquiror pursuant to this
_Article X_ exceeds the amount of the Escrow Property, then the amount of such
excess shall be paid by Seller to Acquiror by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Acquiror.

 

Section 10.05 _Exclusive Remedies_. Each of Seller and Acquiror acknowledges
and agrees that:

 

(a) prior to the Closing, other than in the case of actual fraud by Seller or
its Affiliates or Representatives or a misrepresentation by Seller that is
intentional and material, the sole and exclusive remedy of Acquiror for any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder, shall be
refusal to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 10.05(a)_ shall limit any remedy
available to Acquiror following the Closing); and

 

(b) following the Closing, other than in the case of actual fraud by Acquiror
or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and
except for breaches or non-performance of provisions in this Agreement for
which the remedy of specific performance is available pursuant to _Section
11.14_, the indemnification provisions of _Article X_ and, with respect to
Taxes, _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and
Acquiror, respectively, for any breach of the representations or warranties in
this Agreement or in any such certificate or instrument and for any failure
to perform or comply with any covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

Section 10.06 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) Seller and Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each
indemnification obligation in this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or any
other document executed or delivered in connection with the Closing (i)
each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (ii) all
Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds (as set forth in
subsection (d)

 



 

80  below), (iii) in no event shall the Indemnifying Party have liability to the
Indemnified Party for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or
punitive damages, lost profits or similar items (other than any such damages,
lost profits or similar items actually paid to any unaffiliated third party)
and (iv) in no event shall Seller have any liability or obligation to any
Acquiror Indemnified Person to the extent that any Loss, or any portion
thereof, as applicable, for which indemnification is sought hereunder is
reflected or reserved for or otherwise taken into account in determining the
Final Tangible Book Value. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Indemnified Party shall have any
right to, or make any claim for, indemnification (x) under _Section
10.01(a)(i)_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss, or any portion
thereof, has been taken into account in calculating any payment required by
_Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.07_ or (y) under _Section 10.01(a)(iii)_ (with
respect to the payment of any amount under _Section 2.06_ or  _Section
2.07_) for any Loss to the extent that Acquiror or any Acquiror Indemnified
Party has been indemnified for such Loss, or any portion thereof, pursuant to
_Section 10.01(a)(i)_.

 

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has actually
reimbursed it pursuant to this _Article X_ (other than Retained Insurance
Proceeds), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the
sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount
expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.

 

(c) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

(d) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may be
covered, in whole or in part, by third-party insurance coverage (each, an "
_Insurance Policy_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party (a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the
Indemnifying Party so requests within sixty (60) days after receipt of a
Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall use all reasonable efforts to
collect the maximum amount of insurance proceeds thereunder, in which event
(i) all such proceeds actually received, net of costs reasonably incurred by
the Indemnified Party in seeking such collection, shall be considered "
_Eligible Insurance Proceeds_ " and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable costs incurred in
connection with such collection. If the Indemnifying Party does not request
that the Indemnified Party seek coverage of any portion of such Loss under the
Insurance Policy within sixty (60) days after receipt of a Notice
of Insurance, any proceeds that the Indemnified Party may receive thereunder
shall be considered " _Retained Insurance Proceeds_ ".

 

Section 10.07 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

Section 11.04 _Public Announcements_. Prior to Closing, no party to this
Agreement or any Affiliate or Representative of such party shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or public announcement or otherwise
communicate with any news media in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or applicable securities exchange
rules, in which the case the party required to publish such press release
or public announcement shall allow the other parties a reasonable opportunity
to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such
publication if reasonably practicable. Prior to the Closing, neither of the
parties to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, shall make any disclosure concerning plans or intentions
relating to the customers, agents or employees of, or other Persons with
significant business relationships with, any of the Companies without first
obtaining the prior written approval of the other party, which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld.

 

Section 11.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in

 



 

83  order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 11.06 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the
Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent
not in conflict with this Agreement, between or on behalf of Seller and/or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on the other
hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

Section 11.07 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may assign its rights hereunder to any
of its Affiliates, but no such assignment shall release Acquiror from any
liability or obligation under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 11.07_ shall be void. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

Section 11.08 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article
X_ with respect to the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.09 _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a
written instrument signed by all the parties to such agreement.

Section 11.10 _Schedules_. Any disclosure with respect to any Section of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of other Sections of
this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure sets forth facts in
sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure would be
reasonably apparent to a reader of such disclosure. Matters reflected in any
Schedule of this Agreement are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
any Schedule of this Agreement shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a
possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or Governmental Order shall
be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred.

 

Section 11.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Subject to _Section 2.05_, each
of Seller and Acquiror irrevocably and unconditionally:



 

84 (a) submits for itself and its property in any Action arising out of
or relating to the Transaction Agreements, the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements, the formation, breach, termination or validity of
the Transaction Agreements or the recognition and enforcement of any judgment
in respect of the Transaction Agreement, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of New York sitting in the County of New York, the court
of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and

(c) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in _Section 11.03_; and

 

(d) agrees that nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement
shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner
permitted by the Laws of the State of New York.

Section 11.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New
York without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles of such state to
the extent such principles would require or permit the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
AGREEMENTS, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT.

 

Section 11.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific wording or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall be
entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or cure breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court referenced in _Section 11.11(a)_ having jurisdiction, such
remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any party may be
entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 11.15 _Rules of Construction_. Interpretation of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements (except as specifically provided in any such
agreement, in which



 

85  case such specified rules of construction shall govern with respect to such
agreement) shall be governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words
in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words

similar import when used in the Transaction Agreements shall mean "

headings contained in the Transaction Agreements are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the
Transaction Agreements; (g) the word "day" shall mean "calendar day" unless
otherwise specified; and (h) the Transaction Agreements shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

 

Section 11.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Agreements may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by the different
parties to each such agreement in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
