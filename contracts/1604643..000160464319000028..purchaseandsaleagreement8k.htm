(g) any accounts payable (i) to the extent for which there is not an adequate
accrual in the Closing Statement, (ii) which constitute intercompany payables
owing to Affiliates of the Operating Sellers, (iii) which constitute
Indebtedness (except to the extent that it reduces

(h) any Liabilities (including Liens) of the Operating Sellers relating to or
arising from unfulfilled commitments, quotations, purchase orders, customer

Section 2.06 Local Conveyance Agreements. Buyer and its Affiliates and
Operating Sellers acknowledge that certain of the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets
and the MEMCOR® Product Line Liabilities in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, Canada,
China and Australia, and other transactions contemplated by the other
Transaction Agreements, are customarily or required to be conveyed under local
law. At Closing, the Parties shall, and/or Buyer shall cause one or more Buyer
Designees to, convey, assign and assume all such MEMCOR® Product Line Assets
and MEMCOR® Product Line Liabilities, other transactions contemplated by the
other Transaction Agreements, applicable to those jurisdictions under separate
agreements and instruments customary for a transaction such as this, governed
by applicable local law, consistent in all substantial respects with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement and mutually acceptable to the relevant
parties thereto (the "Local Conveyance Agreements").

Section 2.07 Purchase Price; Base Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price
payable by Buyer and/or one or more Buyer Designees for the purchase of the
Evoqua AU Shares and the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets and assumption of the
MEMCOR® Product Line Liabilities (the "Purchase Price") shall be an amount
equal to ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US $110,000,000)
("Base Purchase Price"), (i) increased by the amount of Cash held by the AU
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time ("Closing Cash"), (ii) decreased by the
amount of Indebtedness of the AU Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and any
Indebtedness included as MEMCOR® Product Line Liabilities and any additional
amount paid under Section 2.11(a)(iii) (in the aggregate, the "Closing
Indebtedness Amount"), (iii)(A) increased by the amount by which the Working
Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital ("Closing Working Capital Surplus")
or (B) decreased by the amount by which the Working Capital is less than the
Target Working Capital ("Closing Working Capital Deficiency"), as applicable,
and (iv) decreased by the EBITDA Adjustment Amount. "Target Working Capital"
means an amount equal to TWELVE MILLION, TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US $12,227,000). All payments made hereunder shall be

30 Section 2.08 Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
(i) to the Evoqua AU Shares, which amount shall be further allocated to the
Land Holdings and Goods of the AU Subsidiaries, and (ii) to the MEMCOR®
Product Line Assets, which amount shall be further allocated among each
Operating Seller holding MEMCOR® Product Line Assets and among the MEMCOR®
Product Line Assets held by such Operating Seller, in accordance with this
Section 2.08 and Section 1060 of the Code and any analogous non-U.S. Tax
provisions (the "Allocation"). No later than October 21, 2019, Sellers shall
deliver a schedule setting forth their determination of the Allocation
("Allocation Schedule"), along with supporting documentation, to Buyer for
Buyer's review and comment. Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing of any
objection(s) with respect to the Allocation Schedule no later than November 1,
2019 ("Dispute Notice"). If the Buyer has not delivered a Dispute Notice on or
before November 1, 2019, the Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding
upon the Parties, in the absence of manifest error. If the Buyer has delivered
a Dispute Notice on or before November 1, 2019, the Buyer and Sellers shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute. If a dispute cannot be
resolved by the Parties on or before November 11, 2019, then such dispute
shall be referred to an Expert. The Sellers and Buyer agree to share the costs
of such an Expert, use their reasonable efforts to ensure that the Expert
gives, no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
written decision to the Parties and each such Party shall agree that, in the
absence of manifest error, the Expert\'s decision is final and binding on
them. The Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted as necessary and appropriate
to reflect any post-Closing adjustments in Section 2.13, provided, however,
that the adjustments made to the Allocation Schedule shall be consistent with
the methodology used in determining the Allocation Schedule prior to the
Closing Date. Sellers and Buyer shall file their respective IRS Forms 8594 and
all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in accordance with the final
Allocation Schedule except as otherwise required by Law.

Section 2.09 Closing. The closing of the purchase, sale and assignment of the
Evoqua AU Shares, the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets and the MEMCOR® Product Line
Liabilities and related transactions (the "Closing") shall take place on the
second Business Day following the date on which all of the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE IX (excluding those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied as part of the Closing) have been satisfied or waived at the offices
of KandL Gates LLP, 210 Sixth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, or at such other
place, time or date as the Parties may agree (the date on which the Closing
actually occurs, the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that in no event
shall Closing occur prior to November 30, 2019 or after the Outside Closing
Date if so elected by Buyer or Sellers pursuant to Section 11.01(b) or Section
11.01(c), respectively. Closing shall be effective at the Effective Time.

Section 2.10 Pre-Closing Deliveries by Seller. No later than four (4) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
combined balance sheet of the Operating Companies applicable solely to the
MEMCOR® Product Line (for clarity including the AU Subsidiaries but excluding
all Excluded Assets and all Excluded Liabilities) as of the Effective Time
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and a written statement
(together with such balance sheet, the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting
forth Sellers' good faith and reasonable estimate as of the Effective Time of
(i) the amount of Closing Cash (such estimated amount, "Estimated Closing
Cash"), (ii) the Closing Indebtedness Amount (such estimated amount, the
"Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount"), (iii) the amount of Working



31 Capital (such estimated amount, the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), and
(iv) Closing Working Capital Surplus (such estimated amount, the "Estimated
Closing Working Capital Surplus") or the amount of the Closing Working Capital
Deficiency (such estimated amount, the "Estimated Closing Working Capital
Deficiency"), as applicable, and setting forth Sellers' good faith and
reasonable estimate of the Purchase Price based upon such estimates (the
"Estimated Closing Payment"). The Estimated Closing Statement shall include
all supporting schedules, analyses and details in support of Sellers'
calculation of the items set forth therein. Buyer may provide Sellers non-
binding comments on the Estimated Closing Statement up to two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing, which comments Sellers will reasonably consider in
good faith in making updates or modifications to the Estimated Closing
Statement. Promptly after Buyer has provided its comments (if any) to Sellers
pursuant to the foregoing sentence (but in all events no less than one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing), Sellers shall deliver to Buyer an updated,
final Estimated Closing Statement that reflects any changes made pursuant to
the foregoing sentence (if any) (the "Final Estimated Closing Statement"),
which Final Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to replace and
supersede the Estimated Closing Statement originally delivered pursuant to
this Section 2.10, and shall set forth the final (i) Estimated Closing Cash,
(ii) Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, (iii) Estimated Closing Working
Capital, (iv) Estimated Closing Working Capital Surplus or Estimated Closing
Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and (v) Estimated Closing Payment.
The Estimated Closing Statement, Final Estimated Closing Statement and all
amounts, estimates, determinations and calculations therein shall be prepared
and calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the example
calculation of Working Capital set forth on Section 2.13(a) of Schedule A. For
clarity, the Estimated Closing Payment shall not include the EBITDA Adjustment
Amount (estimated or actual), which shall be determined solely pursuant to
Section 2.14, unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing.

Section 2.11 Closing Deliveries by Buyer.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall, and/or shall cause one or more Buyer
Designees to:

(i) pay to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds to
an account designated in a written notice by Sellers (and provided to Buyer no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) an amount equal to
the Estimated Closing Payment;

(ii) pay the Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount on behalf of Sellers or the
AU Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of the

instructions (or, if no such wire transfer instructions are specified therein,
otherwise in accordance with the payment instructions in the applicable payoff
letters or written instructions); and

(iii) if, in paying an amount under Section 2.11(a)(ii), the Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer is required by Law to make any deduction or withholding for
any Tax ("Tax Deduction"), the Buyer or such Affiliate shall make that Tax
Deduction and pay it



32 to the relevant Governmental Authority and pay an additional amount to the
holder of the Indebtedness together with the payment of the Indebtedness so
that, after making the Tax Deduction, the holder of the Indebtedness receives
an amount equal to the payment that would have been due if no Tax Deduction
had been required.

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall, and/or shall cause one or more Buyer
Designees to, also deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Sellers, the
following:

(i) a counterpart for each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party,

Closing liability or obligation of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (including
the AU Subsidiary), and (ii) all non-trade intercompany balances and accounts

documents, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as may be
required to give effect to this Agreement.

Section 2.13 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Buyer shall no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, prepare
and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Sellers a combined
balance sheet of the Operating Companies applicable solely to the MEMCOR®
Product Line (for clarity including the AU Subsidiaries but excluding all
Excluded Assets and all Excluded Liabilities) as of the Effective Time
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and a written statement
(together with such balance sheet, the "Closing Statement") setting forth
Buyer's good faith calculations as of the Effective Time of (i) the amount of
Closing Cash, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness Amount; (iii) the amount of
Working Capital ("Closing Working Capital"), and (iv) Closing Working Capital
Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and setting
forth Buyer's good faith calculation of the Purchase Price (excluding the
EBITDA Adjustment Amount) based upon the foregoing. The Closing Statement and
all amounts, estimates, determinations and calculations therein shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles,
consistent with Sellers' past practices, and the example calculation of
Working Capital set forth on Section 2.13(a) of Schedule A.

(b) Sellers shall review the Closing Statement during the thirty (30) day
period commencing on the date Buyer delivers the Closing Statement to Sellers.
At or prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period, Sellers may deliver a
written notice to Buyer to the effect that Sellers disagree with the Closing
Statement ("Notice of Disagreement"), specifying the nature and amount



34 of such disagreement and the adjustments that, in its opinion, should be made
to the amount(s) of the items set forth in the Closing Statement in order to
revise it (collectively, the "Closing Statement Proposed Adjustments").

(c) To the extent that there are any Closing Statement Proposed Adjustments,
Buyer shall, no later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Notice of
Disagreement, notify Seller which, if any, of the Closing Statement Proposed
Adjustments it accepts or rejects, and Sellers and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve any differences that remain with respect to the Closing
Statement Proposed Adjustments and to reach agreement in writing on any
Closing Statement Proposed Adjustments not accepted by Buyer. If any of the
Closing Statement Proposed Adjustments are not so resolved (the "Unresolved
Closing Statement Adjustments," and the aggregate difference between the
Parties' respective calculations of set forth in the Closing Statement
resulting from the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments, the "Unresolved
Balance") within thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of Sellers' Notice of
Disagreement (or such longer period as the Parties may mutually agree in
writing), then the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments may be submitted
at the request of either Sellers or Buyer to a U.S. nationally recognized firm
with expertise in accounting mutually agreed upon by the Parties in writing
(the "Independent Accountant") for arbitration. The Independent Accountant
cannot be the primary audit firm for either Buyer or Sellers of any of their
respective Affiliates. The scope of the review by the Independent Accountant
shall be limited to (i) a disposition of the Unresolved Closing Statement
Adjustments and (ii) based on its determination of the matters described in
clause (i), a final calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness Amount,
Closing Working Capital, Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working
Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and the Purchase Price. The Independent
Accountant is not to make or be asked to make any determination other than as
set forth in the previous sentence. In connection with the resolution of the
Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments, the Independent Accountant shall not
have access to any documents, records, work papers, facilities and personnel
other than documents, records and other information provided to it by either
party in accordance with this Section 2.13. The Independent Accountant shall
allow Buyer's Representative and Sellers' Representative to present in writing
their respective positions regarding the Unresolved Closing Statement
Adjustments (which the Independent Accountant shall forward to Sellers or
Buyer, as applicable). The Independent Accountant may, at its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments,
at which conference each party shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to have present its advisors,
counsel and accountants. In connection with such process, there shall be no
other hearings or any oral examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or
other similar proceedings. Ex parte communications by the Independent
Accountant with Buyer or Sellers regarding substantive matters shall be
prohibited. The Independent Accountant shall disregard any evidence of
settlement proposals and negotiations between Buyer and in its consideration
of the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments. Sellers and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to render
its written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as
practicable and, if at all possible, within thirty (30) days after such
submission of the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments. In resolving any
Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments, no such determination as to any item
shall be more favorable to Sellers than as provided in the Notice of
Disagreement or more favorable to Buyer than as provided in the Closing
Statement. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Independent
Accountant in any court having



35 jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant incurred
pursuant to this Section 2.13(c) shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, as determined by the Independent Accountant based
on the inverse of the percentage that the Independent Accountant's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the Unresolved Balance. For
purposes of illustration only, if the Unresolved Balance is $100 and if the
final written determination of the Independent Accountant states that $80 of
the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments are resolved in Buyer's favor and
$20 of the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments are resolved in Sellers'
favor, Buyer would bear twenty percent (20%) of the Independent Accountant's
costs and expenses, on the one hand, and Sellers would bear eighty percent
(80%) of such costs and expenses, on the other hand. All other fees, expenses
and costs incurred by Sellers or Buyer in implementing the provisions of this
Section 2.13(c) shall be borne by Sellers or Buyer, respectively.

(d) The calculations of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness Amount, Closing
Working Capital, Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital
Deficiency, as applicable, and the Purchase Price shall become final and
binding on all Parties upon the earliest of (i) the date that is one (1) day
after the thirty (30) day review period specified in Section 2.13(b) has
ended, if no Notice of Disagreement has been delivered by Sellers to Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.13(b) during such thirty (30) day period (in which case
the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness Amount, Closing Working Capital,
Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as
applicable, and the Purchase Price (excluding the EBITDA Adjustment Amount)
shall be as set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section
2.13(a)), (ii) the date of an agreement in writing by Sellers and Buyer that
the Closing Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed to by
Sellers and Buyer, is final and binding (in which case the Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness Amount, Closing Working Capital, Closing Working Capital
Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and the Purchase
Price (excluding the EBITDA Adjustment Amount) shall be as so agreed upon by
the Parties) and (iii) the date on which the Independent Accountant issues its
written decision on the Unresolved Closing Statement Adjustments (in which
case the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness Amount, Closing Working Capital,
Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as
applicable, and the Purchase Price (excluding the EBITDA Adjustment Amount)
shall be as set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section
2.13(a), as adjusted for any Closing Statement Proposed Adjustments agreed to
between Buyer and Sellers and as further adjusted for any Unresolved Closing
Statement Adjustments determined by the Independent Accountant pursuant to
Section 2.13(c)), and at such time the calculation of the Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness Amount, Closing Working Capital, Closing Working Capital
Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and the Purchase
Price (excluding the EBITDA Adjustment Amount) as so agreed (or deemed agreed)
or determined shall constitute the "Closing Statement" for purposes of this
Agreement, and shall have the effect of an arbitral award and shall be used
for the calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
2.13(e).

(e) The "Post-Closing Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the absolute value
of the difference between the Estimated Closing Payment and the Purchase Price
(excluding the EBITDA Adjustment Amount) as so agreed (or deemed agreed) or
determined accordance with Section 2.13(d). If the Purchase Price (excluding
the EBITDA Adjustment Amount) as so agreed



36 (or deemed agreed) or determined accordance with Section 2.13(d) is greater
than the Estimated Closing Payment, Buyer shall, and/or shall cause one or
more Buyer Designees or other Affiliate to, pay in cash to Sellers the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount as provided in Section 2.13(f). If the Purchase
Price (excluding the EBITDA Adjustment Amount) as so agreed (or deemed agreed)
or determined accordance with Section 2.13(d) is less than the Estimated
Closing Payment, Sellers shall pay in cash to Buyer (or its designee(s)) the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount as provided in Section 2.13(f).

(f) Any payment (or payments, if any portion thereof is to be paid by or to an
Affiliate of Buyer) required to be made pursuant to Section 2.13(e) shall be
made within five (5) Business Days after the day on which the Closing
Statement becomes final and binding as provided in Section 2.13(d) to an
account designated by the payee (or payees) no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the date of payment.

(g) For clarity, any adjustment to the Purchase Price attributable to the
EBITDA Adjustment and the timeline for payment thereof shall be determined
solely pursuant to Section 2.14.

Section 2.14 EBITDA Adjustment Amount.

(a) Sellers shall no later than twenty one (21) days after the date of this
Agreement, prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, a
written statement (the "EBITDA Statement") setting forth Seller's good faith
calculation of the EBITDA of the MEMCOR® Product Line for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2019 ("Actual EBITDA"), and any resulting EBITDA
Adjustment Amount, together with all supporting financial statements and a
"quality of earnings" report prepared by KPMG US LLP. The EBITDA Statement
shall consist of (i) the existing KPMG Quality of Earnings Report, dated
September 4, 2019 with respect to the MEMCOR® Product Line for the nine months
ended June 30, 2019 (the "June 30 QOE Report") and (ii) a "quality of
earnings" report to be prepared by KPMG for the results of operations of the
MEMCOR® Product Line for the three months ended September 30, 2019 (the
"September 30 QOE Report"). The September 30 QOE Report shall be prepared in
substantially the same form as, and prepared using the same methodology,
procedures and assumptions as used in, the June 30 QOE Report. The September
30 QOE Report shall reflect (x) that any and all percentage-of-completion
adjustments that impact any quarter prior to the quarter ended September 30,
2019 incurred in the quarter ended September 30, 2019, and (y) any other
adjustments as mutually agreed by Sellers and Buyer.

(b) Buyer shall review the September 30 QOE Report during the fourteen (14)
day period commencing on the date Sellers deliver the EBITDA Statement to
Buyer. At or prior to the end of such fourteen (14) day period, Buyer may
deliver a written notice to Sellers to the effect that Buyer disagrees with
the September 30 QOE Report ("EBITDA Statement Notice of Disagreement"),
specifying the nature and amount of such disagreement and the adjustments
that, in its opinion, should be made to the amount(s) of the items set forth
in the EBITDA Statement in order to revise it (collectively, the "EBITDA
Statement Proposed Adjustments"); provided, however, that Buyer's EBITDA
Statement Proposed Adjustments shall not include any adjustments (i) with
respect to or based on the June 30 QOE Report or applicable to the nine months
ended June



37 30, 2019, or (ii) that are applicable to the three months ended September 30,
2019 to the extent that such adjustments are inconsistent with the
methodology, procedures and assumptions used in the June 30 QOE Report. For
clarity, subject to Section 2.14(a) Buyer has accepted the June 30 QOE Report
and the methodology, procedures and assumptions used to prepare the June 30
QOE Report, and no part of the EBITDA Adjustment Amount or the EBITDA
Statement Proposed Adjustments shall be based on changes to the June 30 QOE
Report or the methodology, procedures and assumptions used to prepare the June
30 QOE Report, and no part of the EBITDA Adjustment Amount or the EBITDA
Statement Proposed Adjustments shall be based on changes to the September 30
QOE Report if and to the extent that they are inconsistent with the
methodology, procedures and assumptions used in the June 30 QOE Report.

(c) Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that there are any EBITDA
Statement Proposed Adjustments, Sellers shall, no later than ten (10) days
after receipt of the EBITDA Statement Notice of Disagreement, notify Buyer
which, if any, of the EBITDA Statement Proposed Adjustments it accepts or
rejects, and Sellers and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that remain with respect to the EBITDA Statement Proposed
Adjustments and to reach agreement in writing on any EBITDA Statement Proposed
Adjustments not accepted by Sellers. If any of the EBITDA Statement Proposed
Adjustments are not so resolved (the "Unresolved EBITDA Statement
Adjustments," and the aggregate difference between the Parties' respective
calculations of set forth in the EBITDA Statement resulting from the
Unresolved EBITDA Statement Adjustments, the "Unresolved EBITDA Statement
Balance") within ten (10) days after Buyer's receipt of Sellers' EBITDA
Statement Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as the Parties may
mutually agree in writing), then the Unresolved EBITDA Statement Adjustments
may be submitted at the request of either Sellers or Buyer to the Independent
Accountant for arbitration. The Independent Accountant cannot be the primary
audit firm for either Buyer or Sellers of any of their respective Affiliates.
The scope of the review by the Independent Accountant shall be limited to (i)
a disposition of the Unresolved EBITDA Statement Adjustments and (ii) based on
its determination of the matters described in clause (i), a final calculation
of Actual EBITDA and any resulting EBITDA Adjustment Amount, all consistent
with the process, procedures and restrictions set forth in Section 2.14(a) and
Section 2.14(b). The Independent Accountant is not to make or be asked to make
any determination other than as set forth in the previous sentence. In
connection with the resolution of the Unresolved EBITDA Statement Adjustments,
the Independent Accountant shall not have access to any documents, records,
work papers, facilities and personnel other than documents, records and other
information provided to it by either party in accordance with this Section
2.14(c). The Independent Accountant shall allow Buyer and Sellers'
Representative to present in writing their respective positions regarding the
Unresolved EBITDA Statement Adjustments (which the Independent Accountant
shall forward to Sellers or Buyer, as applicable). The Independent Accountant
may, at its discretion, conduct a conference concerning the Unresolved EBITDA
Statement Adjustments, at which conference each party shall have the right to
present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present its advisors, counsel and accountants. In connection with such
process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings. Ex parte communications
by the Independent Accountant with Buyer or Sellers regarding substantive
matters shall be prohibited. The Independent Accountant shall disregard any
evidence of settlement proposals and negotiations between Buyer and in its
consideration of the Unresolved EBITDA



38 Statement Adjustments. Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to render its written decision
resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as practicable and, if at
all possible, within fifteen (15) days after such submission of the Unresolved
EBITDA Statement Adjustments. In resolving any Unresolved EBITDA Statement
Adjustments, no such determination as to any item shall be more favorable to
Sellers than as provided in the EBITDA Statement Notice of Disagreement or
more favorable to Buyer than as provided in the EBITDA Statement. Judgment may
be entered upon the determination of the Independent Accountant in any court
having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant incurred
pursuant to this Section 2.14(c) shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, as determined by the Independent Accountant based
on the inverse of the percentage that the Independent Accountant's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the Unresolved EBITDA
Statement Balance. For purposes of illustration only, if the Unresolved EBITDA
Statement Balance is $100 and if the final written determination of the
Independent Accountant states that $80 of the Unresolved EBITDA Statement
Adjustments are resolved in Buyer's favor and $20 of the Unresolved EBITDA
Statement Adjustments are resolved in Sellers' favor, Buyer would bear twenty
percent (20%) of the Independent Accountant's costs and expenses, on the one
hand, and Sellers would bear eighty percent (80%) of such costs and expenses,
on the other hand. If there is no EBITDA Adjustment Amount, then Buyer shall
pay 100% of such costs and expenses. All other fees, expenses and costs
incurred by Sellers or Buyer in implementing the provisions of this Section
2.14(c) shall be borne by Sellers or Buyer, respectively.

(d) The calculations of Actual EBITDA and any resulting EBITDA Adjustment
Amount shall become final and binding on all Parties upon the earliest of (i)
the date that is one (1) day after the fourteen (14) day review period
specified in Section 2.14(b) has ended, if no EBITDA Statement Notice of
Disagreement has been delivered by Buyer to Sellers pursuant to Section
2.14(b) during such fourteen (14) day period (in which case Actual EBITDA and
any resulting EBITDA Adjustment Amount shall be as set forth in the EBITDA
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.14(a)), (ii) the date of an
agreement in writing by Sellers and Buyer that the EBITDA Statement, together
with any modifications thereto agreed to by Sellers and Buyer, is final and
binding (in which case Actual EBITDA and any resulting EBITDA Adjustment
Amount shall be as so agreed upon by the Parties) and (iii) the date on which
the Independent Accountant issues its written decision on the Unresolved
EBITDA Statement Adjustments (in which case Actual EBITDA and any resulting
EBITDA Adjustment Amount, as adjusted for any EBITDA Statement Proposed
Adjustments agreed to between Buyer and Sellers and as further adjusted for
any Unresolved EBITDA Statement Adjustments determined by the Independent
Accountant pursuant to Section 2.14(c)), and at such time the calculation of
Actual EBITDA and any resulting EBITDA Adjustment Amount as so agreed (or
deemed agreed) or determined shall constitute the "EBITDA Statement" for
purposes of this Agreement, and shall have the effect of an arbitral award and
shall be used for the calculation of the EBITDA Adjustment Amount pursuant to
Section 2.14(e).

(e) The "EBITDA Adjustment Amount" shall be an amount equal to (i) the amount
by which the EBITDA Target exceeds Actual EBITDA as so agreed (or determined
accordance with Section 2.14(c)) is less than the EBITDA Target, multiplied by
(ii) 12.50, provided, however, if the Actual EBITDA as so agreed (or
determined accordance with Section 2.14(c)) is



39 equal to or greater than the EBITDA Target, the EBITDA Adjustment Amount shall
be equal to zero (0). If the EBITDA Adjustment Amount is greater than zero,
Sellers shall pay in cash to Buyer or one or more Buyer Designees (as directed
by Buyer) the EBITDA Adjustment Amount as provided in Section 2.14(f). For
clarity, the Parties acknowledge that the EBITDA Adjustment Amount may not be
determined until after the Closing Date.

(f) Any payment (or payments, if any portion thereof is to be paid by or to an
Affiliate of Buyer) required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14(e) shall be
made within five (5) Business Days after the day on which the EBITDA Statement
becomes final and binding as provided in Section 2.14(c) to an account
designated by Buyer or one or more Buyer Designees no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of payment; provided, however, that no such
payment shall be made prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2.15 Non-Assignable MEMCOR® Product Line Assets. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.15, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery, to Buyer or any Buyer Designee of any MEMCOR® Product Line Asset
would result in a violation of applicable Law or any Contract (or is otherwise
impermissible), or would require the consent, authorization, approval, waiver,
notice or novation by or to a Person who is not a party to this Agreement or
an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (including any Governmental
Authority), and such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice or
novation shall not have been obtained or made prior to the Closing and an
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, without such
consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice or novation would constitute
a breach of such MEMCOR® Product Line Asset, or with respect to which any
attempted assignment would be ineffective (collectively, the "Unassigned
Rights"), this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or delivery, thereof; provided, however, that subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions contained in ARTICLE IX the Closing shall occur
notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on
the account thereof. Following the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other, to
obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice or
novation, or any release, substitution or amendment required to novate all
liabilities and obligations under any and all MEMCOR® Product Line Assets or
other liabilities that constitute assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing
the unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements, so that, in any
case, Buyer or a buyer Designee shall be solely responsible for such
liabilities and obligations from and after the Closing Date pursuant to the
terms hereof; provided, however, that neither Sellers nor Buyer nor any Buyer
Designee shall be required to pay any consideration thereof. Until such
consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice or novation that is necessary
for the valid and effective assignment to Buyer or a Buyer Designee of any
Unassigned Right is obtained, or in the event any Unassigned Right cannot be
transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee following the Closing pursuant to
this Section 2.15, provided that Sellers can do so without breaching the terms
of such Unassigned Right and to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Sellers shall provide Buyer or a Buyer Designee with, and Sellers shall hold
for the exclusive benefit of Buyer or the applicable buyer Designee, all the
economic, operational and other benefits of such Unassigned Right, to the
extent permitted, as if such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice



40 or novation, as the case may be, had been obtained or made. Without limitation
of and subject to the foregoing, at Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's request
Sellers shall: (i) cooperate, in all reasonable respects, in any lawful
arrangement proposed by Buyer or a Buyer Designee under which Buyer or a Buyer
Designee would obtain the economic, operational and other benefits thereunder
and assume any related economic burden thereunder; (ii) enforce for the
benefit of Buyer or a Buyer Designee and as reasonably directed by Buyer or a
Buyer Designee such Seller's rights under such Unassigned Right as if such
Unassigned Right had been sold, conveyed, assigned and delivered to Buyer or a
Buyer Designee, including in the name of Seller(s) as party to such Unassigned
Right or otherwise as Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall specify, including the
right to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof; and (iii) permit
Buyer or a Buyer Designee to enforce any rights arising with respect thereto;
provided, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, that, to the extent Seller is in compliance with all of its
obligations under this Section 2.15 Buyer shall, and/or shall cause a Buyer
Designee to, assume the related economic burden imposed on Sellers with
respect to such Unassigned Rights and Buyer shall, and/or shall cause a Buyer
Designee, as agent or subcontractor for Sellers pay, perform and discharge
fully as and when required the liabilities and obligations of Sellers with
respect to such Unassigned Rights from and after the Closing to the extent
such liabilities arise after the Closing or, if arising prior to the Closing,
would have been MEMCOR® Product Line Liabilities had the Unassigned Rights
been included in the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets. Sellers, as party to such
Unassigned Right, will promptly pay to Buyer or a Buyer Designee all income,
proceeds and other monies received by Sellers from third parties to the extent
related to Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's intended rights under such Unassigned
Right as contemplated by this Section 2.15 and, to the extent that Buyer or a
Buyer Designee has not already reimbursed Sellers for such expenses and Taxes
pursuant to clause "(iii)" of the immediately preceding sentence, net of any
applicable reasonable expenses incurred and Taxes are paid or payable by
Sellers in connection with the receipt of such income, proceeds, or other
monies. Once such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice or novation
is obtained or made, Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver
to Buyer or a Buyer Designee the relevant MEMCOR® Product Line Asset to which
such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, notice or novation relates for
no additional consideration. Applicable sales, transfer and other similar
Taxes in connection with such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
license shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.14.

Section 2.16 Withholding. Buyer and any Buyer Designee shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts
payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Law, including
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, as applicable.
Buyer shall, and/or shall cause an applicable Buyer Designee to, give the
recipient party no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date notice
of its intention to make such other deductions or withholdings for the
recipient party to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and timely
paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made. Buyer shall promptly provide
to Sellers proof of payment and applicable government receipts with respect to
any withheld Taxes.



41 Section 2.17 Wire Transfers. All wire transfers to be received by a Party or
any one or more of its Affiliates or designees pursuant to this Agreement
shall be pursuant to wire transfer instructions to such Party or any one or
more of its Affiliates as directed in writing by such Person.

thereof (including the AU Subsidiary), and (b) all non-trade intercompany
balances and accounts between or among the Seller Parties and/or any Affiliate
of any Seller Party shall be settled or otherwise eliminated without any
further liability to a Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (including the AU

good faith begin to explore alternatives for Sellers to obtain the raw
material supplies under such contract for the benefit of Buyer at a purchase
price equal to Sellers' cost.

Section 6.07 Confidentiality.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that, in the course of its and its Affiliates
investigation of Sellers, the MEMCOR® Product Line and the assets owned by the
Operating Companies, Buyer, and its Representatives have become aware of
Seller Confidential Information, and that its use of such Seller Confidential
Information, or communication of such Seller Confidential Information to Third
Parties (in each case, other than, after the Closing, any Seller Confidential
Information related to Sellers, or the MEMCOR® Product Line), could be
detrimental to Sellers or its Affiliates. Buyer covenants that, for the two-
year period following the Closing Date, it shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose or
use such Seller Confidential Information without Sellers' prior written
consent; provided, however, Buyer, its Affiliates, and Representatives may
disclose Seller Confidential Information, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) to its Representatives in connection with the performance
of Buyer's or its applicable Affiliate's obligations under this Agreement or
the Transaction Agreements, (ii) in connection with Buyer's or its applicable
Affiliate's enforcement of Buyer's or its applicable Affiliate's rights, as
applicable, hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreements, (iii) in any
report, statement, testimony or other submission to any Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over Buyer, its Affiliates, or Representatives, or (iv) as
requested or required (by applicable Law, regulation, stock exchange rule, or
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), subject to the
further provisions of this Section 6.07. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives are requested or required (by Law, regulation, stock exchange
rule, or subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose
any such Seller Confidential Information, Buyer will promptly notify Sellers
in order to permit Sellers (at their sole cost and expense) to seek a
protective order or take other appropriate action. In such circumstances,
Buyer will reasonably cooperate in Sellers' efforts to obtain a protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such Seller Confidential Information. If, in the absence of a
protective order, Buyer, any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives are, based on the advice of Buyer's outside legal counsel,
required as a matter of Law to disclose such Seller Confidential Information,
then Buyer, such Affiliate, or such Representative may disclose to the party
requesting or requiring disclosure or as it orders only that part of such
Seller Confidential Information as is required by Law to be disclosed and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment therefor.
Upon Sellers' request, Buyer will, at its election, return or destroy, and
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to return to Sellers or destroy, all
such Seller Confidential Information provided by or on behalf of Sellers and
destroy all Seller Confidential Information prepared by Buyer or its
Affiliates or Representatives.

(b) Each Seller acknowledges that in connection with the operation of the
MEMCOR® Product Line and the ownership of the assets used or held for use in
MEMCOR® Product Line each Seller, its Affiliates and its Representatives have
or will become aware of MEMCOR® Confidential Information. Each Seller
acknowledges that its, its Affiliates' or its Representatives' use of such
MEMCOR® Confidential Information or communication of such MEMCOR® Confidential
Information to Third Parties, could be detrimental to Buyer or its



84 Affiliates. Each Seller covenants that, for the two-year period following the
Closing Date, it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
maintain in confidence and not disclose or use MEMCOR® Confidential
Information without Buyer's prior written consent; provided, however, each
Seller, its Affiliates, and Representatives may disclose MEMCOR® Confidential
Information, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) to its
Representatives in connection with the performance of such Seller's or its
applicable Affiliate's obligations under this Agreement or the Transaction
Agreements, (ii) in connection with such Seller's or its applicable
Affiliate's enforcement of such Seller's or its applicable Affiliate's rights,
as applicable, hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreements, (iii) in
any report, statement, testimony or other submission to any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over such Seller, its Affiliates, or
Representatives, or (iv) as requested or required (by applicable Law,
regulation, stock exchange rule, or subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process), subject to the further provisions of this Section 6.07(b).
If a Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are requested or
required (by Law, regulation, stock exchange rule, or subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such MEMCOR®
Confidential Information, such Seller will promptly notify Buyer in order to
permit Buyer (at its sole cost and expense) to seek a protective order or take
other appropriate action. In such circumstances, such Seller will reasonably
cooperate in Buyer's efforts to obtain a protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such MEMCOR®
Confidential Information. If, in the absence of a protective order, such
Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are, based
on the advice of such Seller's outside legal counsel, required as a matter of
Law to disclose such MEMCOR® Confidential Information, then such Seller, such
Affiliate, or such Representative may disclose to the party requesting or
requiring disclosure or as it orders only that part of such MEMCOR®
Confidential Information as is required by Law to be disclosed and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment therefor.
Upon Buyer's request, each Seller will, at its election, return or destroy,
and cause its Affiliates and Representatives to return to Buyer or destroy,
all such MEMCOR® Confidential Information.

Section 6.08 Non-Compete.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (b) below, each Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, in any manner whatsoever during
the period from the Closing Date to the earlier of (x) the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, and (y) the occurrence of a Change of Control
of Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. (the "Restricted Period"), anywhere in the
world, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with
any other Person, manufacture microfiltration and ultrafiltration, low
pressure, hollow fiber membrane modules of the type currently manufactured by
the Operating Companies in the MEMCOR® Product Line for use in the physical
removal of non-dissolved contaminants from water for drinking water and
wastewater applications (the "Restricted Manufacturing Activity").

(b) Notwithstanding any provisions or restrictions contained in this Section
6.08, nothing in this Section 6.08 shall prohibit or restrict a Seller, or its
Affiliates, from:



85 (i) owning as a passive investment less than five percent (5%) in the
aggregate of the publicly traded voting securities of any entity that engages
in the Restricted Manufacturing Activity;

(ii) acquiring, owning and operating a Person the activities of which consist
of Restricted Manufacturing Activity so long as such activities contribute
less than either 30% or $20 million of the consolidated total revenues of such
Person measured for the twelve (12) month period ended immediately prior to
the date of such acquisition; and

(iii) being acquired by one or more Persons that engage in the Restricted
Manufacturing Activity.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" of a Person means (a)
the acquisition by any person or group (including a group within the meaning
of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended), other than such Person or any of its subsidiaries, of beneficial
ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of a majority of the combined voting power
of such Person's then outstanding voting securities, or (b) the sale of all or
substantially all the assets of such Person and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

(d) Sellers shall provide prompt written notice to Buyer of a Change of
Control of Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.

Section 6.09 Employee Non-Solicit. During the period from the Closing Date to
the earlier of (x) the one (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, and (y) the
occurrence of a Change of Control of Evoqua Water Technologies Corp., each
Seller shall not, and shall cause such Seller's Affiliates not to, either
individually or in partnership, jointly or in conjunction with any other
Person, directly or indirectly solicit, hire, engage, retain the services of
(as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any employee
of the MEMCOR® Product Line immediately prior to Closings, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
general advertising, web postings or a solicitation program (including through
search firms) that are not specifically targeted at Buyer's (or its
Affiliate's) employees, consultants or independent contractors and any hiring
of Persons who respond to such advertising, postings or programs.

Section 6.10 Reasonableness of Covenants. Sellers acknowledge and agree with
Buyer that: (a) Section 6.08 or Section 6.09 are reasonable in the
circumstances and are necessary to protect the value of the business acquired
by Buyer; (b) Sellers will receive a substantial financial benefit as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; Section 6.08 or Section
6.09 were a material inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement; the
breach by any Seller of any of the provisions of Section 6.08 or Section 6.09
would cause serious and irreparable harm to Buyer and the MEMCOR Product Line
which could not adequately be compensated for in damages; and (c) the
principles of law to be applied to the interpretation of Section 6.08 or
Section 6.09 are those that generally apply to restrictive covenants given by
a seller on the sale of a business. Sellers consent to and agree that Buyer
shall be entitled to an order specifically enforcing the provisions of Section
6.08 or Section 6.09, or an order of injunction being issued against it
restraining it from



86 any breach of such provisions. The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall not
derogate from any other remedy which Buyer may have in the event of such a
breach.

Section 6.11 Further Assurances.

(a) From time to time following the Closing, the Parties shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge, and deliver all
reasonable further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases, and
acquittances and such instruments, and shall take such reasonable actions as
may be necessary or appropriate to make effective the Contemplated
Transactions as may be reasonably requested by the other Party; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.11(a) shall require either Party or
its Affiliates to expend any money, commence, or participate in any Action or
incur Liabilities with respect to, or to offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any Third Party following the Closing.

(b) In furtherance, and not by way of limitation, of the foregoing, if after
the Closing, (i) any Party or any of such Party's Affiliates discovers that
any of the assets (other than Intellectual Property or Technology) of the AU
Subsidiaries that are not primarily or exclusively used, or held for use, in
the MEMCOR® Product Line as currently conducted, as conducted during the
period covered by the Financial Statements (taking into account ordinary
course and recurring changes and other immaterial changes to the MEMCOR®
Product Line during or subsequent to such period), and as contemplated to be
conducted at the Closing were inadvertently or mistakenly contributed to the
AU Subsidiaries, then Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including
the AU Subsidiaries) to (A) promptly cease using such assets and (B) cooperate
with Sellers to transfer or assign such assets to Sellers (or their
designee(s)) with no requirement of additional consideration to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and execute and deliver any amendments or
supplements to the Transaction Agreements to transfer such assets to Sellers
(or its designee(s)) effective as of the Closing Date, and (ii) any Party or
any of such Party's Affiliates discovers that any of the assets (other than
Intellectual Property or Technology) primarily or exclusively used, or held
for use, in the MEMCOR® Product Line as currently conducted, as conducted
during the period covered by the Financial Statements (taking into account
ordinary course and recurring changes and other immaterial changes to the
MEMCOR® Product Line during or subsequent to such period), and as contemplated
to be conducted at the Closing were inadvertently or mistakenly not retained
by, or not transferred to, the AU Subsidiaries, then Sellers shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, (A) promptly cease using such assets and (B)
cooperate with Buyer to transfer or assign such assets to Buyer (or its
designee(s)) with no requirement of additional consideration to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and execute and deliver any amendments or
supplements to the Transaction Agreements to transfer such assets to Buyer
effective as of the Closing Date. The Parties agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to structure any transfer of assets referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence in a manner that minimizes Taxes and is
equitable from a legal perspective for the Parties and the AU Subsidiaries.

(c) If after the Closing, (i) any Party or any of such Party's Affiliates
discovers any Intellectual Property or Technology owned by Sellers as of the
Closing that is used, or held for use, primarily or exclusively in the
business of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (excluding the MEMCOR® Product
Line) as conducted on the Closing Date, as conducted during the period



87 covered by the Financial Statements (taking into account ordinary course and
recurring changes and other immaterial changes to the such business during or
subsequent to such period), and as contemplated to be conducted on the Closing
Date that was inadvertently or mistakenly assigned or licensed to Buyer, then
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Sellers to
license such Intellectual Property or Technology to Sellers (or its
designee(s)) with no requirement of additional consideration to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and execute and deliver any amendments or
supplements to the Transaction Agreements to license such Intellectual
Property or Technology to Sellers (or their designee(s)) effective as of the
Closing Date, (ii) any Party or any of such Party's Affiliates discovers any
Intellectual Property or Technology owned by Sellers or their Affiliates as of
the Closing, that is primarily or exclusively used, or held for use, in the
MEMCOR® Product Line (but, in the case of patents, exclusively used or held
for use in the MEMCOR® Product Line and owned by Sellers or its Affiliates as
of the Closing Date) as conducted on the Closing Date, as conducted during the
period covered by the Financial Statements (taking into account ordinary
course and recurring changes and other immaterial changes to the MEMCOR®
Product Line during or subsequent to such period), and as contemplated to be
conducted on the Closing Date that was inadvertently or mistakenly not
assigned or licensed to Buyer, then Sellers shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer to assign such Intellectual Property or
Technology to Buyer (or its designee(s)) with no requirement of additional
consideration to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and execute
and deliver any amendments or supplements to the Transaction Agreements to
assign such Intellectual Property or Technology to Buyer (or its designee(s))
effective as of the Closing Date, or (iii) any Party or any of such Party's
Affiliates discovers any Intellectual Property or Technology owned by Sellers
or its Affiliates as of the Closing that is used, or held for use, primarily
or exclusively in the MEMCOR® Product Line as conducted on the Closing Date,
as conducted during the period covered by the Financial Statements (taking
into account ordinary course and recurring changes and other immaterial
changes to the MEMCOR® Product Line during or subsequent to such period), and
as contemplated to be conducted on the Closing Date, and that was
inadvertently or mistakenly not assigned or licensed to the AU Subsidiaries or
Buyer, then Sellers shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with
Buyer to license such Intellectual Property or Technology to Buyer (or its
designee(s)) with no requirement of additional consideration to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and execute and deliver any amendments or
supplements to the Transaction Agreements to license such Intellectual
Property or Technology to Buyer (or its designee(s)) effective as of the
Closing Date. For clarity, except as provided in clause (ii) of this Section
6.11(c), neither Party shall be obligated to transfer or assign any

(a) At or after the Closing Date, but for the period beginning from the
Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and any of its
Affiliates as third party beneficiaries from and against any and all
Liabilities arising out of or in connection with any Surety Arrangements and
any and all present and future obligations and Liabilities of Sellers or any
of its Affiliates arising under or in connection with such Surety
Arrangements, including Seller's fees and other direct costs of carrying such
Surety Arrangements, payable in arrears within ten (10) Business Days of the
date of receipt of the invoice for the respective calendar quarter. Buyer
shall also procure that Sellers and any of its Affiliates be fully released by
the beneficiaries and issuers



88 of the respective Surety Arrangements from any Surety Arrangements by the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, it being understood that Buyer's
obligation to procure such release shall continue to exist after such period
to the extent such release has not yet been achieved.

(b) As long as and to the extent Sellers and any of its Affiliates are not
fully released from the Surety Arrangements by the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Sellers a monthly fee equal to (i) Seller's
fees and other direct costs of carrying such Surety Arrangements, plus (ii) a
monthly fee equal to 50 basis points per annum of the nominal amount
guaranteed in respect of each such Surety Arrangement outstanding as of the
last day of each calendar month, payable quarterly in arrears within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of receipt of the invoice for the respective
calendar quarter. For each year after the Closing Date commencing on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, the amount of the monthly fee in
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall increase (per year) by
50 basis points per annum.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, with effect as of Closing neither Sellers nor

extend any obligations or liabilities in connection with any of the Surety
Arrangements.

Section 6.13 Insurance. At the Effective Time, all of Sellers' insurance
coverage applicable to the AU Subsidiaries and the MEMCOR® Product Line and
the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets shall terminate. Buyer shall, or shall cause

Section 3.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, and any other desired
insurance coverage, with Buyer's own insurance coverage, effective at the
Effective Time.

ARTICLE VII 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01 Employment of All Transferring Employees.

(a) Terms and Conditions of Employment. Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall offer
employment to all employees of an Operating Company (not already employed by
an AU Subsidiary) working primarily in the MEMCOR Product Line. For a period
of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
shall be entitled to receive, while in the employ of Buyer (which employment
shall be "at will" unless otherwise specified by contract or applicable law),
the AU Subsidiaries, or any of its respective Affiliates, at least the same
salary and wages and substantially comparable bonus opportunities as were
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date ("Comparable
Employment"). The term "other material terms and conditions" in the
immediately preceding sentence is limited to practices that, if changed or
eliminated, could reasonably give rise to a claim against Sellers or its
Affiliates on or following the Closing for monetary damages under applicable
Law or Contract. In addition, for a period of at least one (1) year following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the AU
Subsidiaries) to provide each Continuing Employee, while in the employ of
Buyer (which employment shall be "at will" unless otherwise specified by
contract or applicable law), with employee benefits in the aggregate that are
comparable to the employee benefits provided to such



89 Continuing Employee under the applicable Employee Benefit Plans in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that, for purposes of this
covenant, pension benefits under Tax-qualified and non-Tax qualified defined
benefit pension plans, retiree health benefits, stock options, and other
equity awards shall be disregarded.

(b) Vacation and Paid Time Off. For a period of at least one (1) year
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide vacation benefits to Continuing Employees while they are in the employ
of Buyer or its Affiliates that are comparable to those provided under the
applicable vacation program of Sellers and its Affiliates; provided, however,
that, for a period of at least one (1) year following June 30, 2019 (unless a
longer period is required by Law), each Continuing Employee shall be entitled
to an annual credit of at least the number of vacation days such Continuing
Employee was entitled to be credited with annually under the applicable
vacation program of Sellers or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date, which annual credit shall be offset against any entitlement to vacation
days under the applicable vacation policy or program of Buyer. Effective as of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume or
retain, as the case may be, all obligations of Sellers and their Affiliates
for the accrued and unused vacation and paid time off of Transferring
Employees and Former MEMCOR® Product Line Service Providers, and shall
reimburse Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the AU Subsidiaries) for any
such accrued and unused vacation and paid time off required to be paid by any
of them to Transferring Employees or Former MEMCOR® Product Line Service
Providers. Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no obligation or Liability
to pay or provide any vacation or paid time off payments claimed by
Transferring Employees on or after the Closing Date to the extent such
obligation or Liability is reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

(c) Severance Benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide severance
benefits to any Continuing Employee who is laid off or terminated during the
one-year period following the Closing Date in an amount that is equal to the
severance benefits provided under the severance arrangements of Buyer
applicable to similarly situated employees, in each case to be calculated,
however, on the basis of such Continuing Employee's compensation and accrued
service with Buyer on and after the Closing Date.

(d) Credit for Service. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit
Continuing Employees for service earned or credited on and prior to the
Closing Date with Sellers and their Affiliates (including the AU
Subsidiaries), or any of their respective predecessors, in addition to service
earned with Buyer and its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, (i) to the
extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting, or the
calculation of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and comparable benefits
(but not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals) under any
retirement or other employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates for the benefit of the Continuing Employees on or after
the Closing Date and (ii) for such additional purposes as may be required by
applicable Law; provided, that, nothing herein shall result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the Continuing Employees.

(e) Health Coverage, Pre-existing Conditions; Coordination. Effective on the
Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall have established a group health
plan or plans providing



90 coverage to each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) that
provides the same type of group health plan benefits as provided to such
Continuing Employee under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan
under which such Continuing Employee is eligible immediately prior to the
Closing Date. In addition, and without limiting the generality of this Section
7.01(e): (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all benefit plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates (the "Buyer Benefit
Plans") to the extent coverage under such Buyer Benefit Plan replaces coverage
under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each
Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any Continuing Employee, Buyer shall cause (A) all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Buyer Benefit
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions and actively-at-
work requirements would apply under the analogous Employee Benefit Plan, and
(B) any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents under an Employee Benefit Plan during the portion of the
plan year prior to the Closing Date to be taken into account under such Buyer
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-
payment, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Benefit Plan. The
above notwithstanding, any waiver or other obligations of Seller with respect
to pre-existing conditions shall be subject to, and limited by, applicable
Law.

(f) Termination. Nothing in this Section 7.01 restricts the right of Buyer to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee.

(g) WARN Act. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith with each to
provide any notice required under the WARN Act or similar state or local laws,
and Buyer shall timely provide Seller with all information required to issue
any such notices required prior to the Closing Date. Buyer will be responsible
for providing any notification that may be required after the Closing under
the WARN Act or similar state or local laws, with respect to any U.S.
Transferring Employees.

Section 7.02 U.S. Plans.

(a) No Assumption of Seller Employee Benefit Plans. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in the Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
assume any obligations under or Liabilities with respect to, or receive any
right or interest in any trusts relating to, the Seller Employee Benefit
Plans.

(b) Participation in Seller Employee Benefit Plans. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that, (i) all Transferring Employees shall cease, effective as of the
Closing Date, any participation in and any benefit accrual under each of the
Seller Employee Benefit Plans, and (ii) Transferring Employees may continue
after the Closing Date to participate, in accordance with, and subject to,
their eligibility under the terms of the applicable Seller Employee Benefit
Plans as in effect from time to time under the Seller Employee Benefit Plans
that provide health, disability, severance, worker's compensation, life
insurance, or comparable benefits with respect to claims



91 incurred by Transferring Employees and their respective eligible spouses,
dependents or qualified beneficiaries, as applicable, on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse Sellers
promptly for any payments under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, upon receipt of periodic billing for such amounts, as well as
accrued and unpaid insurance premiums and other amounts as of the Closing Date

95 Section 8.01 Liability for Taxes. The Operating Sellers shall be liable for,
and indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from, any and all Excluded Taxes,
together with the amount of Loss which arises from, or relates to, any of the
Excluded Taxes. Buyer shall be liable for, and indemnify and hold the
Operating Sellers harmless from, all Taxes associated with the MEMCOR® Product
Line Assets and the conduct of the MEMCOR® Product Line for the Post-Closing
Tax Period and all Taxes associated with the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets and
the conduct of the MEMCOR® Product Line for a Straddle Period that are
apportioned to the portion of such period beginning after the Closing Date
under Section 8.02, except to the extent that any Taxes result from, or are
attributable to, a breach of the Tax Warranty.

Section 8.02 Apportionment of Taxes. In the case of any Straddle Period, all
property and ad valorem Taxes and assessments on the MEMCOR® Product Line
Assets for any Straddle Period shall be prorated between Operating Sellers and
Buyer, as of the close of business on the Closing Date based on the best
information then available, with (i) Operating Sellers being liable for such
Taxes attributable to any portion of a Straddle Period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date and such Taxes shall be allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and (ii) Buyer being liable for such Taxes attributable to any portion
of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date. Information available
after the Closing Date that alters the amount of property Taxes due with
respect to the Straddle Period will be taken into account and any change in
the amount of such Taxes shall be prorated between Operating Sellers and
Buyer. All prorations under this Section 8.02 shall be allocated so that items
relating to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date shall be allocated to the Operating Sellers based upon the number of days
in the Straddle Period on or prior to the Closing Date and items related to
the portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be
allocated to Buyer based upon the number of days in the Straddle Period after
the Closing Date. The amount of all such prorations shall, if able to be
calculated on or prior to the Closing Date, be paid on the Closing Date or, if
not able to be calculated on or prior to the Closing Date, be calculated and
paid as soon as practicable thereafter. Any refunds of property and ad valorem
Taxes with respect to the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets for any Straddle Period
actually received will be apportioned between Buyer and Operating Sellers in a
manner consistent with the allocation of Taxes as set forth in this Section
8.02.

Section 8.03 Cooperation and Records. After the Closing Date, the parties
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding relating to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request and at such other party's cost
and expense) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to
any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 8.03, access to, use of, and destruction of such records shall
be in accordance with Section 6.04.

Section 8.04 Contest Provisions. If, after the Closing, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receive notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments or other disputes, assessments or proceedings concerning Taxes
with respect to which Operating Sellers may incur indemnification liability
under this Agreement (a "Tax Proceeding"), Buyer shall promptly notify
Operating Sellers



96 of the Tax Proceeding in writing and in any event within ten (10) days after
receiving the notice of the Tax Proceeding, provided, however that the failure
to provide such notice shall not excuse the Seller Parties from their
indemnification obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that the
Operating Sellers are actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Operating Sellers shall have the right to represent its interests in
any Tax Proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Operating Sellers shall not be entitled to
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, a Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Except as provided in the
next sentence, Buyer, at its expense, shall be entitled to participate in any
Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Buyer shall not (i) be entitled to participate in any Tax Proceeding with
respect to a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which
includes Operating Sellers or any Affiliate of a member of the group filing
such Tax Return; or (ii) be entitled to any information regarding or copy of
any Tax Return described in the immediately preceding clause (i) (or portion
thereof). This Section 8.04 and not Section 10.02 (other than Section
10.02(d)) shall apply in determining the handling and control of a Tax
Proceeding.

Section 8.05 Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, documentary, stamp,
registration, value added and other similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") that are
payable in connection with the sale of the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets
pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by the party that is subject to such
Taxes under applicable Law. The party required by applicable Laws to file any
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such Taxes shall
prepare and file such Tax Returns, and Buyer and Operating Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate in the timely preparation and
filing of, and join in the execution of, any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer Taxes shall not include
income Taxes.

Section 8.06 Certain Tax Elections. Buyer or its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the AU Subsidiaries) may make an election pursuant to

except to the extent the Seller is actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

Section 8.09(c) where a Tax Enquiry under Section 8.09(a) or Tax Claim relates

loss, Liability, costs or other damage suffered as a result of a breach of any

details of the objection, including (i) the items in dispute, (ii) as far as
possible, the amount in dispute, and (iii) as far as possible, the adjustments
or amendments to the Relevant Return which they are seeking.

procedural fairness, and (iii) exercising the Expert's own skill, judgment and
experience.

its advisers, unless the Expert, in its absolute discretion, decides

(a) At least seven (7) Business Days before Closing, if the AU Seller is able,
it may sign and deliver a validly completed declaration that the Evoqua AU
Shares that it owns are not indirect Australian real property interests (as
that term is defined in section 855-25 of the Tax Act (1997)). The declaration
must satisfy the requirements in section 14-2103(3)(a) of Schedule 1 to the

amount of, any Loss suffered or incurred by Buyer if the declaration given by
the AU Seller under this Section 8.22 is false at the relevant times.

copy of the declaration referred to in Section 8.22(a) (and that satisfies the
requirements therein) at least seven (7) Business Days before Closing and it
does not know the declaration in Section 8.22(a) is false, it will not
withhold any amounts from the Purchase Price under Subdivision 14-D of
Schedule 1 to the TAA.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, AU Seller acknowledges that, if AU Seller does
not provide Buyer with a copy of a declaration in accordance with Section

that part of the Purchase Price that is allocated to the AU Shares in
accordance with Section 2.08.

Section 8.23 Transfer Taxes. The Buyer and/or each applicable Buyer Designee
shall be liable for, and shall pay, in a due and timely manner any stamp duty

connection with or attributable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
in the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns to the extent required
pursuant to applicable Law.

Agreement, all amounts payable or consideration to be provided under this

Seller shall treat the supply of the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets under this
Agreement as a GST-free supply of a going concern.

supply is provided. If a Tax invoice is not received prior to the provision of
the other consideration, the GST Amount is payable within ten (10) days of the
receipt of a Tax invoice. This Section 8.24 shall not apply to the extent that
the consideration for the supply is expressly stated to be GST inclusive or
the supply is subject to reverse charge.

(d) Liability Net of GST. In the event that any indemnity, reimbursement or
similar payment under this Agreement is based on any cost, expense or other
Liability, it shall be reduced by any input Tax credit entitlement in relation
to the relevant cost, expense or other Liability.

(e) Adjustment Events. If an adjustment event occurs in relation to a supply
made under or in connection with this Agreement, the GST Amount shall be
recalculated to reflect that adjustment and an appropriate payment shall be
made between the Parties.

(f) Survival. This Section 8.24 will not merge upon completion and will
continue to apply after expiration or termination of this Agreement.

(g) Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, words and phrases used
in this Section 8.24 that have a specific meaning in the GST Law shall have
the same meaning in this Section 8.24.

ARTICLE X 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.01 Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

(a) Subject to Section 10.03, the representations and warranties of Sellers
and Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive until
the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time they shall
terminate; provided, however, that the Fundamental Representations of
Operating Companies and the Fundamental Representations of Buyer (other than
the Tax Warranty) shall survive until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, further, that the representations and warranties under
Section 3.14 shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. The Tax Warranty and Tax indemnities under
Section 8.01 and Section 8.08 (and Buyer's related remedies under Section
10.01(b)(ii)) shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, at which time they shall terminate and
thereafter no claims shall be made for indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto. The covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement that by
their terms (i) do not contemplate performance after the Closing, shall not
survive the Closing (except for pre-closing breach thereof) and (ii)
contemplate performance after the Closing, shall survive the Closing
consistent with the terms of the relevant covenant or agreement subject to
applicable statute of limitations; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 10.01 shall impair a Party's rights under Section
11.03 in the event this Agreement has been validly terminated, and the other
Party had materially breached this Agreement prior to the time of such
termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if,
prior to the end of the applicable survival period, a party shall have
notified the other party in accordance with the requirements of Section
10.02(a) of a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE X (whether or not
formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim, shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
ARTICLE X notwithstanding the expiration of the relevant survival period
following the assertion of such claim and prior to its resolution.

(b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this ARTICLE X, Sellers shall
jointly and severally indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, successors and assigns (each a "Buyer Indemnified Party")
against, and shall hold each Buyer Indemnified Party harmless from and
against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any
Buyer Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representations of
Operating Companies,

(ii) Taxes to the extent either expressly allocated to Sellers or their
Affiliates or with respect to which the Operating Sellers would have an
indemnification obligation pursuant to ARTICLE VIII,



108 (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by any Seller Party in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement that survives the Closing or
breach of pre-Closing covenants by any Seller Party,

(iv) the discharge of water from the Leased Real Property to a sewer owned by
Hawkesbury City Council, to South Creek, onto land for irrigation, or
otherwise, prior to Closing,

(v) the Specified Indemnity set forth on Schedule A,

(vi) any Indebtedness (other than any Indebtedness related to the Settlement
Agreement) not repaid as of the Closing or included in the final and binding
Closing Statement as provided in Section 2.13,

(vii) consummation of the Pre-Closing Transactions, including any Taxes
resulting from or attributable to consummation thereof;

(viii) Fraud on the part of any Seller Party, and

(ix) any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability.

provided that, all indemnification by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement for
all matters, including for Fraud, shall not cumulatively and in the aggregate
exceed the amount of the Purchase Price proceeds received by Sellers. Any
amounts the Buyer recovers or is entitled to recover under the RandW Policy
shall be taken into account when calculating such aggregate maximum amount
that the Sellers are liable under the proviso of the immediately preceding
sentence. "Fundamental Representations of Operating Companies" means those
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.01, Section 3.02,
Section 3.05, Section 3.14 and Section 3.19. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement and except in the case of Fraud, with
respect to any Losses (x) based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of and Fundamental Representation of
Operating Companies, or (y) for Taxes, such Losses shall be satisfied first
from the RandW Policy to the fullest extent of applicable coverage thereunder
(if any), and second, to the extent such Losses are not covered in full by the
RandW Policy, directly against the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Losses for which indemnification is to be provided under Section 10.01(b)(v)
shall be limited to out of pocket costs and expenses and such Losses shall be
shared seventy five (75%) percent to Sellers and twenty five (25%) percent to
Buyer.

(c) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this ARTICLE X, Buyer shall
indemnify Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
successors, and assigns (each a "Seller Indemnified Party") against, and shall
hold each Seller Indemnified Party harmless from and against, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, each Seller Indemnified
Party based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representations of Buyer,



109 (ii) Taxes to the extent either expressly allocated to Buyer or with respect
to which Buyer would have an indemnification obligation pursuant to ARTICLE
VIII,

(iii) any breach of any non-Tax covenant or agreement by Buyer in this
Agreement that survives the Closing or breach of pre-Closing covenants by
Buyer or its Affiliates,

(iv) Fraud on the part of Buyer or its Affiliates,

(v) the MEMCOR® Product Line Liabilities, and

(vi) the ownership and operation of the MEMCOR® Product Line Assets following
the Closing;

provided, that, all indemnification by Buyer this ARTICLE X shall not in the
aggregate exceed the Purchase Price. "Fundamental Representations of Buyer"
means those representations and warranties and set forth in Section 4.01,
Section 4.02, Section 4.07 and Section 10.03(a).

(d) For purposes of Section 10.01(b)(i), when determining whether a
representation or warranty of an Operating Company has been breached or is
inaccurate, and the amount of any Losses related thereto, any knowledge
qualifier or Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifier contained
in any such representation or warranty shall be disregarded. For clarity and
the avoidance of double-counting, and notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else herein to the contrary, no Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for a matter to the extent that such matter (dollar-
for-dollar) shall have been taken into account in the post-Closing adjustments
to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.13.

Section 10.02 Notification of Claims; Cooperation; Insurance, Etc.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Person that may be
entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party")
shall promptly notify the Party liable for such indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing of any pending or threatened claim, demand or
circumstance that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a
third party against the Indemnified Party, but excluding a Tax Enquiry covered
in Section 8.09, such claim being a "Third Party Claim"), describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim, demand or circumstance (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party); provided, however, that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this ARTICLE X except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure, it
being understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered before the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in Section 10.01(a) for
claims with respect to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.
The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond to the Indemnified Party in writing to any claim that is not
a Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed



110 its indemnity obligation for any Losses with respect to such claim, the
parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute
and, if not resolved through negotiations, subject to Section 10.06, the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party under the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 10.02(a) with respect to any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to assume,
upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within a reasonable time
(applicable to the circumstances) of receipt of such notice of a claim, the
defense and control of any Third Party Claim and, in the event that the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such claim, it shall allow the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
maintain the defense or control of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is
failing to prosecute or defend the Third Party Claim vigorously, (iii) the RandW
Policy provides that the insurer will control the defense of prosecution of
such claim, or (iv) the amount of the Third Party Claim, if determined in
accordance with the claimant's demands, would reasonably be expected to result
in Losses, together with all other unresolved claims for indemnification by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties (as
applicable), the majority of which would not be available for recovery under
this ARTICLE X. The Person that shall control the defense of any such Third
Party Claim (the "Controlling Party") shall select counsel, contractors and
consultants of recognized standing and competence after consultation with the
other Party and shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim.

(c) The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense with counsel selected by it,
subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof;
provided that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable
fees and reasonable expenses of such separate counsel (i) to the extent
incurred by the Indemnified Party before the date that the Indemnifying Party
assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim; or (ii) if the
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party are both named as parties in a Third
Party Claim and, based on the advice of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A)
there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that makes it reasonably necessary for separate counsel to
represent the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, or (B) there are
one or more defenses or counterclaims with respect to such Third Party Claim
available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from
or relating to or associated with such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall
enter into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).



111 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 10.02, in the event that a
Third Party Claim in respect of which a Buyer Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party and the RandW Policy is covering the potential liability with
respect thereto (a "RandW Policy Claim"), Buyer and its designees (including,
without limitation, the insurance providers of the RandW Policy) shall be
entitled to assume, control the defense of and settle or compromise such RandW
Policy Claim, and Sellers shall not have any rights with respect thereto,
including the right to participate in, defend or settle, compromise or offer
to settle or compromise such RandW Policy Claim, except to the extent that
Sellers would have liability thereunder.

(e) Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Controlling Party
in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified Party;
provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall (A) pay all amounts arising out
of such settlement or judgment in accordance with the terms of such
settlement, (B) not encumber any material asset of any Indemnified Party or
agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or materially
adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified
Party's business and (C) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected
by such Third Party Claim; and (ii) such settlement or consent shall not
result in the finding or admission of any violation of Law or any other
admission of wrongdoing on the part of any Indemnified Party.

(f) Payments by any Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss shall be limited
to the amount of any Liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds receivable from any Third Party non-Affiliate
by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such
Losses (net of costs of recovery and increase in premiums), including the RandW
Policy, and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received or
reasonably expected to be received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any
such claim. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution, or
other similar agreements for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under
this Agreement. Each Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach that gives rise to such Loss.

Section 10.03 RandW Policy. Buyer represents, warrants and covenants to Sellers
that:

(a) A true, accurate and complete copy of the binder agreement for the
representation and warranty policy (the "RandW Policy") and the form of the RandW
Policy is attached as Exhibit C. The binder agreement for the RandW Policy is in
full force and effect and is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Buyer, and to the Knowledge of Buyer, the insurer(s) party
thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contractual contingencies
to which Buyer is a party related to the issuance of the RandW Policy other than
as expressly set forth in the binder agreements attached as Exhibit C. The RandW
Policy expressly provide that (i) the insurer has no



112 subrogation rights, and will not pursue any claim against Sellers or their
Affiliates, in each case, except in the case of Fraud by any such Person, and
(ii) Sellers are third-party beneficiaries of the insurer's subrogation waiver
and covenant not to pursue claims referenced in clause (i) of this sentence.

(b) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not amend, waive, or otherwise modify the
RandW Policy in any manner adverse to Sellers, including any amendment that
would allow the insurer thereunder or any other Person to subrogate or
otherwise bring any Action against Sellers or their Affiliates, if applicable,
of any of the foregoing based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the sole and exclusive
recourse for Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party for recovery of Losses for
breaches of any representations and warranties made by the Operating Companies
under this Agreement (other than Fundamental Representations of Operating
Companies) is the RandW Policy. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Buyer
Indemnified Party's rights under the RandW Policy.

Section 10.04 Tax Treatment. All indemnification payments made under this
Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 10.05 Gross Up for Tax. If an indemnification payment made under this
Agreement would result in an increase in the Tax payable in any year by, or
the reduction in any Tax loss, deduction, credit (other than franking credits)
or offset of, a Buyer Indemnified Party ("Tax Relief"), then the payment must
be grossed-up by the amount necessary to ensure that the net amount retained
by the Buyer Indemnified Party after deduction or payment of that Tax or the
reduction in the value of any Tax Relief equals the amount that the Buyer
Indemnified Party would have retained had that Tax not been payable or had
that Tax Relief not been reduced.

Section 10.06 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 2.13(c), the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than under the RandW
Policy and claims arising from Fraud on the part of a Party in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions) for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement, are set forth in ARTICLE VIII and this
ARTICLE X. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under Law and effective as of the Closing, any and
all rights, claims, and causes of action for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to this Agreement it may have against the other Parties and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based
upon any Law, except pursuant to the provisions set forth in ARTICLE VIII and
this ARTICLE X. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 10.01, nothing in
this Section 10.06 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy
on account of any Fraud by any Party.



113 ARTICLE XI 

TERMINATION

Section 11.01 Grounds for Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the
Contemplated Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
Date:

(a) by the mutual written agreement of Sellers and Buyer;

(b) by Buyer (i) if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to December 15,
2019, unless (ii) the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 shall not have been
satisfied at least two (2) Business Days before November 30, 2019, in which
event the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the date that is two (2)
Business Days after the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 shall have been
satisfied, but (iii) in no event later than December 31, 2019 (such applicable
date in (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately preceding, the "Outside Closing
Date"); provided, that, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.01(b) shall not be available if Buyer's failure to fulfill any of
its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in the
failure of, the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Closing Date;

(c) by Sellers if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside
Closing Date; provided, that, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 11.01(c) shall not be available if any Seller Party's failure
to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in the failure of, the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside
Closing Date;

(d) by Buyer if there has been a breach by any Seller Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
and the effect of such breach would be to cause the conditions to Buyer's
obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in Section 9.01 or Section 9.02
not to be capable of being satisfied, and such breach is not cured, or is not
reasonably capable of being cured, within 30 days of receiving written notice
of such breach or alleged breach from Buyer; it being understood and agreed
that this Agreement may not be terminated for such breach pursuant to this
Section 11.01(d) during such 30-day period or following such 30-day period if
such breach is cured during such 30-day period; provided, however, that such
30-day period shall not extend the Outside Closing Date; provided, further,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)
shall not be available if the failure of Buyer to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such
breach;

(e) by Sellers if there has been a breach by Buyer of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement and the effect of
such breach would be to cause the conditions to Seller's obligation to
consummate the Closing set forth in Section 9.01 or Section 9.03 not to be
capable of being satisfied, and such breach is not cured or is not reasonably
capable of being cured within 30 days of receiving written notice of such
breach or alleged breach from Seller; it being understood and agreed that this
Agreement may not be terminated for such breach pursuant to this Section
11.01(e) during such 30-day period or following such 30-day period if such
breach is cured during such 30-day period (provided, however, that such 30-day
period shall not



114 extend the Outside Closing Date); provided, further, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(e) shall not be
available if the failure of any Seller Party to fulfill any of its obligations
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such breach; or

(f) by either Party if there shall be in effect a final, non-appealable Order
of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining,
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions; it
being agreed that the Parties shall promptly appeal any adverse determination
which is appealable (and pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence);
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 11.01(f) shall not be available to a Party if such Order, or failure
to resolve, or have vacated or lifted, such Order, was primarily due to the
failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 11.02 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination and abandonment of this Agreement by Sellers or Buyer pursuant to
Section 11.01, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party. If this Agreement is validly terminated and the Contemplated
Transactions are abandoned as provided herein:

(a) each Party shall redeliver all documents, work papers and other material
of any other Party relating to the Contemplated Transactions, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the
same;

(b) all confidential information received by any Party with respect to the
business of any other Party or any of its Affiliates shall be treated in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; and

(c) all filings, applications and other submissions made to any Person,
including any Governmental Authority, in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from such Person.

Section 11.03 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated
and the Contemplated Transactions are abandoned in accordance with Section
11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect
(other than ARTICLE X, this ARTICLE XI, ARTICLE XII and Section 5.03 and
Section 5.08, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and be enforceable by the Parties and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein), and there shall be
no Liability or obligation on the part of any Party to any other Party, except
for material breaches of this Agreement or Fraud, in each case, prior to the
time of such termination. Nothing in this ARTICLE XI shall be deemed to impair
the right of any Party to compel specific performance by any other Party of
its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 12.02 Amendments and Modifications. Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by each Party.

Section 12.03 Waiver. No waiver hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set
forth in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of
the waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with
respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way
impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect or at
any other time. Neither the waiver by any Party of a breach of or a default
under any provision of this Agreement, nor the failure by any Party, on one or
more occasions, to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any
right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other
breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any such provision,
right, or privilege hereunder.

Section 12.04 Seller Disclosure Schedules and Buyer Disclosure Schedules
References. The disclosure of any matter in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, shall
be deemed to be a disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement and for all
Sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules,
as applicable, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Sections of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable,
but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission or indication by
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material for the purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure in a Section of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as
applicable, shall be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that any such
matter is required to be disclosed. No disclosure in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable,
relating to a possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. The disclosure of any matter in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, is not
to be treated as constituting or implying any representation, warranty,
assurance or undertaking by a Party not expressly set forth in this Agreement
or as adding to or extending the scope of any of a Party's representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules but not
otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

Section 12.05 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation
and execution of this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions, and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, including any advisor fees and
expenses, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are consummated, shall
be paid by the Person incurring such cost or expense, except that all such
unpaid expenses at Closing incurred by AU Subsidiaries not reflected in the
Closing



117 Statement shall be paid by AU Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 12.05 shall impair a Party's rights under Section 11.03 in the
event this Agreement has been validly terminated, and any of the other Parties
had materially breached this Agreement prior to the time of such termination.

Section 12.06 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of
Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
any purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void ab
initio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to assign
all or certain provisions of this Agreement, or any interest herein, and may
delegate any duty or obligation hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer (unless
doing so would restrict or delay the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions); provided, that, no such assignment or delegation shall relieve
Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 12.07 Parties in Interest. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure
solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except to the extent otherwise
provided in Section 12.06.

Section 12.08 Governing Law . This Agreement shall be construed, performed and
enforced in accordance with the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of Laws) as to
all matters, including matters of validity, construction, effect, performance,
and remedies, except to the extent that Australian law may be mandatorily
applicable.

Section 12.09 Jurisdiction.

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any Action with respect to
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (other than
with respect to any dispute arising under Section 2.13, which shall be
governed by the procedure specified therein), or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder brought by any other Party or its successors or
assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the courts of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the courts of the United States located within
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions in any court other than the
aforesaid courts.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.13 (which shall govern any dispute
arising thereunder), each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives and agrees
not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with
respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with Section 12.01; (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
Action commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment, or otherwise); and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable Law,



118 any claim that (A) such Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum; (B) the venue of such Action is improper; or (C) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 12.10 Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS OR THE EQUITY FINANCING. THIS WAIVER MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY
REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 12.10(a) AND EXECUTED BY EACH PARTY). THIS WAIVER
SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS RELATING
TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. The scope of this waiver is intended to be
all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and
that relate to the subject matter of the Contemplated Transactions, including
contract claims, tort claims, breach-of-duty claims, and all other common law
and statutory claims. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed
as a written consent to a trial by the court.

(b) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS; (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS; (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY; AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.10.

Section 12.11 Relationship of the Parties. The Parties agree that this is an
arm's-length transaction in which the Parties' undertakings and obligations
are limited to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement.
Buyer acknowledges that it is a sophisticated investor and that it has only a
contractual relationship with Sellers, based solely on the terms of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements, and the Confidentiality
Agreement, and that there is no special relationship of trust or reliance
between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

Section 12.12 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
In the event that any signature to this Agreement is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a portable document format (.pdf or
similar format) data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding
obligation



119 of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with
the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were
an original thereof. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by each other Party. Until and
unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by each other
Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

Section 12.13 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided herein
with respect to the DandO Indemnified Parties, the representations, warranties,
and agreements of the Parties contained herein are intended solely for the
benefit of the Party to whom such representations, warranties or agreements
are made, and shall confer no rights hereunder, whether legal or equitable, in
any other Person, and no other Person shall be entitled to rely thereon;
provided, however, that the Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that:
(a) the provisions of Section 6.03 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the DandO Indemnified Parties; and (b) the provisions
of Section 12.24 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, KandL Gates.

Section 12.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the other
Transaction Agreements and the other documents and instruments referred to
herein and therein), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Seller Disclosure
Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules set forth the entire agreement
and understanding of the Parties in respect of the Contemplated Transactions
and supersede all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements,
and understandings, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. There are no warranties, representations, or other
agreements between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements, or in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 12.15 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Contemplated
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Contemplated
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 12.16 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury to the other Parties would occur in the event that any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or were otherwise breached, and that such injury would not be adequately
compensable in damages because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of
damages that would be suffered in the event that this Agreement were breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the further provisions of this
Section 12.16, each Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy
to which it is entitled at law or in equity, to specific enforcement of, and
injunctive relief, without proof of actual damages, to prevent any breach or



120 violation of, the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, and the other Parties shall not take action, directly or
indirectly, in opposition to the Party seeking such relief on the grounds that
any other remedy or relief is available at law or in equity. Any requirements
for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived.
The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law, or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
To the extent any Party brings an Action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements prior to Closing, the Outside Closing Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the 20th Business Day following the
resolution of Action or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Sellers shall be entitled to specific performance to cause
Buyer to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

Section 12.17 Representation by Counsel. Each Party acknowledges to the other
Parties that it has been represented by independent legal counsel of its own
choice throughout all of the negotiations that preceded the execution of this
Agreement. Each Party further acknowledges that it and its counsel have had
adequate opportunity to make whatever investigation or inquiry they may deem
necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement
prior to the execution hereof.

Section 12.18 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement and the Table of Contents are for convenience of the Parties only,
and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

Section 12.19 Non-Recourse. No past, present, or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, agent, attorney or Representative of Seller, the
Operating Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates shall be deemed to
(a) have made any representations or warranties, or entered into any covenants
or agreements, in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; or (b) have
any personal liability to Buyer for any obligations or liabilities of Sellers
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Contemplated Transactions. It is
further understood that any Certification contemplated by this Agreement and
executed by an officer or other Representative of a Party shall be deemed to
have been delivered only in such officer's or Representative's capacity as an
officer or Representative, as applicable, of such Party (and not in his or her
individual capacity) and shall not entitle any Party to assert a claim against
such officer or Representative in his or her individual capacity.

Section 12.20 No Set-Off. The obligation of Buyer to pay to Sellers the
Purchase Price and any other payments hereunder, or under any agreements
entered into in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, shall not be
subject to any right of set-off, deduction or withholding against any of
Seller's obligations whatsoever, and Buyer hereby irrevocably waives any and
all such rights, unless required by Law.

Section 12.21 Inconsistencies with Other Agreements. In the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and those
in the other Transaction Agreements referred to herein, the provisions in the
body of this Agreement will prevail and govern.



121 Section 12.22 Obligations of Sellers and Buyer; Authority of Evoqua LLC.
Whenever this Agreement requires an Affiliate of Sellers to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Sellers to cause such Affiliates to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires an Affiliate of Buyer to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Buyer to cause such Affiliate
to take such action. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, all Sellers
hereby appoint Evoqua LLC as their agent and attorney-in-fact and otherwise
grant to Evoqua LLC all rights and powers to act for and on behalf of any one
or all Sellers for any and all purposes under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the right to
rely on Evoqua LLC for all such purposes herein and therein. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, all Affiliates of Buyer hereby appoint Buyer as
their agent and attorney-in-fact and otherwise grant to Buyer all rights and
powers to act for and on behalf of any one or all Affiliates of Buyer for any
and all purposes under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements,
and Sellers shall have the right to rely on Buyer for all such purposes herein
and therein.

Section 12.23 Interpretation.

(a) An item arising with respect to a specific representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth in" a balance sheet or
financial statements, to the extent any such phrase appears in such
representation or warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual, or other
similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial statements
that related to the subject matter of such representation, (ii) such item is
otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or financial statements
or (iii) such item is reflected on the balance sheet or financial statements
and is specifically set forth in the notes thereto. For the avoidance of
doubt, references to "Subsidiary" (or a comparable term) in any statement in
ARTICLE III shall be deemed to refer to such defined term (or comparable term)
determined as of the date on which such statement is made in ARTICLE III.

(b) The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of
similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to
refer to the date on the first page of this Agreement.

(c) The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement.

(d) References to Exhibits, Articles and Sections are to Exhibits, Articles
and Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

(e) All documents that have been made available to Buyer or its
Representatives by Sellers or its Representatives for review in the Data Room
and all other Evaluation Material shall be deemed provided, made available or
delivered to Buyer for purposes of this Agreement.

(f) Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural,
and any plural term the singular.



122 (g) Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation", whether or not they are in fact followed by those words or words
of like import.

(h) "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing and
other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible
form.

(i) References to any Contract are to that Contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof. The disclosure of the name of, or any party to, a Contract, or the
terms or conditions of a Contract, in any Section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules is subject to the restrictions set forth in such Contract or under
applicable Law with respect to such disclosure, and no representations or
warranties of Sellers in ARTICLE III shall be deemed to be untrue or
inaccurate by reason of the disclosure in such Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules being omitted or otherwise limited in order to comply
with such restrictions.

(j) References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of
that Person; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 12.23(j) is intended to authorize, nor shall it be deemed to have
authorized, any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by this
Agreement.

(k) The word "day", unless otherwise indicated, shall be deemed to refer to a
calendar day. References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise
specified, from and including or through and including, respectively. If the
last day for the giving of any notice or the performance of any act required
or permitted under this Agreement is a day that is not a Business Day, then
the time for the giving of such notice or the performance of such action shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.

(l) Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "Law", "Laws" or to a
particular Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as amended from time to
time, and to the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder.

(m) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in the Transaction
Agreements to dollar amounts and to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. Dollars.

Section 12.24 Conflicts and Privilege. Recognizing that KandL Gates has acted as
legal counsel to Sellers and the AU Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and
that KandL Gates intends to act as legal counsel to Sellers after the Closing,
the Parties acknowledge that the AU Subsidiaries have waived, on their own
behalf, and Buyer hereby waives, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with KandL Gates representing the AU Subsidiaries after the Closing. The Parties
also acknowledge that the AU Subsidiaries have agreed, and Buyer also agrees,
that, as to all communications among KandL Gates, on the one hand, and the AU
Subsidiaries and Sellers, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the
Contemplated Transactions and are in fact subject to attorney-client
privilege, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to Sellers, shall be owned and controlled by Sellers and
shall not pass to Buyer or the AU Subsidiaries.
