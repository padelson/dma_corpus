withheld from any amounts payable by Buyer to any Seller under this Agreement
pursuant to any applicable Tax Law, Buyer shall promptly (but in no event
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the time of such withholding)

jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by the Corporation or such Subsidiary or the nature and/or conduct of
the Corporations or such Subsidiarys, as applicable, business makes such

the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have timely filed, or will have timely
filed by the Closing Date, in each case in all material respects, all reports
that any Investor, Insurer, Agency or Governmental Entity, or other third
party requires that it file with respect to its business. To the Knowledge of
the Corporation, the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have not done or caused

insurance or commitment of any private mortgage insurer to insure, (2) any

24 (e) To the Knowledge of the Corporation, neither the Corporation nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice in writing indicating that an event
has occurred or circumstance exists (or would occur or exist upon notice or
the lapse of time or both) that could reasonably be expected to result in the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries not maintaining their Servicing Rights
in respect of any Servicing Agreement in all material respects.

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the aggregate fair market value
of the Servicing Rights, on the Closing Date, the Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will be the sole owner of the Servicing Rights, free and clear
of any Liens, except for Liens and similar claims pursuant to the Existing
Financing Facilities.

(g) Each HECM Loan, except for Investor Mortgage Loans, was underwritten in
accordance with all HUD/FHA requirements and standards applicable to reverse
mortgages and is fully insurable by HUD/FHA, which insurance is in full force
and effect, and all prior transfers, if any, of the HECM Loan has been, and
the transactions herein contemplated are, in compliance with all applicable
HUD/FHA regulations (including, without limitation, the HUD Handbook). No
HECM Loan, except for Investor Mortgage Loans, is subject to any defect that
could diminish or impair the HUD/FHA insurance and no circumstances exist with
respect to the HECM Loans that could permit the HUD/FHA to deny coverage, in
whole or in part, under the related HUD/FHA insurance except for ordinary
deductions from the mortgage insurance payments that are part of the HUD/FHA
Regulations. Each related HUD/FHA policy calls for the assignment of the HECM
Loan to HUD as opposed to the co-insurance option. The entire amount of the
insurance premium due has been paid to HUD/FHA and no portion is shared by the
Seller or, if the monthly premium option has been chosen for such HECM Loan,
all such premiums due on or before the Closing Date have been duly and timely
paid. Each Mortgage note and the related Mortgage meets all applicable HUD/FHA
standards.

 

(h) Each HECM Loan, except for Investor Mortgage Loans, was originated,
pooled, and, if applicable, sold (and if sold and pooled, serviced,) in all
respects, in compliance with material Laws.

(i) For each HECM Loan, except for Investor Mortgage Loans, the related
original Mortgage has been recorded or is in the process of being recorded in
the appropriate jurisdictions wherein such recordation is required to perfect
the lien thereof.

the Ginnie Mae Guide for pooling to back one or more issuances of Ginnie Mae

of the Ginnie Mae Guide. To the Knowledge of the Corporation, each
Participation is eligible for pooling to back one or more issuances of Ginnie
Mae HMBS, including, but not limited to, the participation requirements set
forth in Section 35-5 of the Ginnie Mae Guide. To the Knowledge of the
Corporation, each HECM Loan with respect to which a Participation has been
included in an HMBS Pool satisfies the mortgage eligibility requirements set
forth in Section 35-6 of the Ginnie Mae Guide. To the Knowledge of the
Corporation, no HECM Loans with respect to which a Participation has been
included in an HMBS Pool were "Defective Mortgages" as defined in the Ginnie
Mae Guide at the time of pooling into a HMBS Pool.

 



25 (k) _Section 3.11(k)_ of the Disclosure Schedules contains a true and
complete list of all (i) existing repurchase obligations of the Corporation

number, type and amount of each such HECM Loan Repurchase Obligation and the
basis for the repurchase obligation. Neither the Corporation nor any of its
Subsidiaries has in the past breached, violated or defaulted under, nor is it
currently in breach, violation or default of any of their HECM Loan Repurchase

and the provision by the Sellers to WIMC in writing of all the information
relating to the Sellers required to be included in the Registration

shares of WIMC Common Stock comprising the Stock Consideration, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with WIMC in providing to WIMC all of the information
relating to Sellers required to be included in the Registration Statement,
including without limitation, furnishing to WIMC the information relating to

request of the Seller Representative, WIMC shall register or qualify such
shares of WIMC Common Stock under applicable state securities laws (if any).
After the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, WIMC shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Registration Statement and
any such registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws
effective, current and available until the earliest of (i) such time as all
shares of WIMC Common Stock covered thereby have been sold or can be sold
under Rule 144 of the Securities Act without any limitation, (ii) no such
shares of WIMC Common Stock are beneficially owned by Sellers or (iii) the
first anniversary of the effective date of such registration statement.

of the registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement
thereto (in each case including all exhibits), an electronic version of a copy
of the prospectus contained in such registration statement and any

Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and
such other documents, including documents incorporated by reference,
as Seller may reasonably request.

(c) WIMC shall pay all filing fees, fees of its counsel and accountants and
all of its other expenses (for the avoidance of doubt, WIMC shall not pay any
underwriting or brokerage fees or Sellers counsel fees or other expenses) in
connection with such registration and resale under the Securities Act, and
such registration or qualification under applicable state securities Laws (if
any).

(d) WIMC shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers from and against any
Losses in connection with or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make
the statements not misleading in the Registration Statement, except to
the extent that such Loss is caused by any such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement based upon information relating to any Seller that is
supplied by a Seller for inclusion in the Registration Statement.

 



47 (e) Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless WIMC from and against any Losses
in connection with or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the
statements not misleading in any such registration statement (including any
document incorporated by reference therein), to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such Loss is caused by any such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement based upon information relating to the Sellers that is
supplied by the Sellers for inclusion in the Registration Statement.

(f) Each of Sellers understands and agrees that the WIMC Common Stock received
by each of the Sellers as Stock Consideration hereunder will contain a legend
substantially as follows until such time that such WIMC Common Stock is
transferred pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or in accordance
with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
or until such time as WIMC may notify the transfer agent for such WIMC Common
Stock that the legend shall be removed:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

(g) Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement referred to in
_Section 6.9(a)_, WIMC shall promptly (and in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the effectiveness) notify the transfer agent for the
WIMC\'s Common Stock that the restrictive legend in subsection (f) above shall
be removed from such Common Stock.

(h) WIMC will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of the
WIMC Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(i)(B_) of this
Agreement to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject
to official notice of issuance.

(i) If at any time WIMC is not required to file reports in compliance with
either Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, WIMC shall
reasonably promptly and at its expense, upon the written request of a Seller,
make available adequate current public information with respect to WIMC
within the meaning of Rule 144(c)(2) under the Securities Act.

(j) If WIMC agrees to file a re-sale shelf registration statement (other than
the Registration Statement or a registration statement solely covering equity
securities issued pursuant to a Plan) covering shares of WIMC Common Stock
owned by a stockholder and such re-sale shelf registration statement is to be
declared effective by the SEC sooner than it is contemplated by _Section
6.9(a)_ that the Registration Statement is to be declared effective, WIMC will
use its reasonable best efforts to accelerate the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to delay the
effectiveness of such other registration statement so that it is declared
effective no earlier than the Registration Statement.

 



48 6.10 Allowable Transaction Expense. Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall cause
the Corporation to pay an aggregate amount not to exceed the Allowable

the Corporation and the Sellers as of the Effective Date which will be
entitled to receive Transaction Expenses.

carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

(b) During the period between the Effective Date and the Closing, on or before

7.2 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing Date, each Seller shall (and
shall cause its Related Persons to) keep confidential and not use in any
manner, any and all confidential information relating to the Corporation and
its Subsidiaries or WIMC or WIMCs Affiliates that remains in or comes into
such Sellers or such Related Persons possession in any form. The foregoing
shall not preclude a Seller from (a) disclosing such confidential information
if compelled to disclose the same by judicial or administrative process or by
other requirements of any applicable Law (subject to the following provisions
of this _Section 7.2_), (b) discussing or using such confidential information
if the same hereafter is in the public domain (other than as a result of a
breach of this Agreement) or (c) discussing or using such confidential
information if the same is acquired from a Person that is not known to such
Seller to be under an obligation to keep such information confidential. If any
Seller is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests
for information or documents in legal, administrative, arbitration or other
formal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar
process) to disclose any such confidential information, such Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer of any such request or requirement so that Buyer may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and waive compliance with
the provisions of this _Section 7.2_. If, in the absence of a protective
order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Buyer, any Seller is
required to disclose such information, such Seller, without liability
hereunder, may disclose that portion of such information which such Seller is
legally required to disclose.

 



49 7.3 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the six-
month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Wage and Benefits Continuation
Period_ "), Buyer shall provide employees of the Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by either the Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with
a salary or hourly wage rate that is no less than the salary or hourly wage
rate as provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Further, during the Wage and Benefits Continuation Period, Buyer
shall arrange for Continuing Employees to either continue to participate in
the Benefit Plans in existence immediately prior to the Closing Date, or to
participate in the employee benefit plans of Buyer or Buyers Affiliates that
that provide benefits that are substantially comparable to those provided to
Buyers employees (collectively, the " _New Plans_ ").

(b) Buyer agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall and shall
cause each of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to grant Continuing
Employees credit for any service with such company earned prior to the
Closing Date to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable
Benefit Plan (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes, and (ii) for purposes
of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations, under the New
Plans, in each case, except as would result in duplication of benefits. In
addition, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (A) each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage under such
New Plans replace coverage under comparable Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employee participated prior to Closing, (B) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at
work requirements and similar limitations of such New Plan to be waived for
such Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Benefit Plans, and
(C) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid
during the portion of the plan year of the Benefit Plan ending on the date
such Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying such deductible,
co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses requirements applicable to
such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) _Section 7.3(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth the aggregate
accrued bonuses, as of the Closing Date, for Continuing Employees in respect
of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012 (the " _Accrued Bonus_ "). Prior
to the Closing Date, the Corporation shall pay, or cause to be paid, the
Accrued 2012 Bonus to the Continuing Employees.

 



50 (d) In order to facilitate satisfying the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, the Corporation shall, on or prior to the
Closing Date, (x) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
appropriate waivers with respect to any payments or benefits that could
reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments" and that are provided under any
contractual arrangement with any "disqualified individual" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and (y) submit to
a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation (or other relevant entity) for
their approval of all "parachute payments" for which there is no contractual
entitlement or with respect to which any contractual entitlement has been
waived in accordance with clause (x) above; provided that (i) such
stockholder vote shall be structured in a manner intended to meet the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder, (ii) the Corporation shall first obtain the Buyer\'s written
consent regarding the intended documentation, form and provisions of such
stockholder vote (provided that the Buyer shall review such documentation,

representation that the waivers contemplated under clause (x) above may be
obtained using the Corporation\'s commercially reasonable efforts.

 

(e) This _Section 7.3_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.3_,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
7.3_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 7.3_
will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee of the Corporation or any Continuing Employees. Nothing in this
_Section 7.3_ is intended to interfere with the Buyers right from and after
the Closing, subject to compliance with any applicable Contracts, Benefit
Plans and Laws, to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan, New Plan or the
employment of any Continuing Employee.

 

7.4 Release. In consideration of the premises contained herein, the
consideration to be received by each Seller pursuant to this Agreement for
the sale of the goodwill of the Business, and in consideration of and as an
inducement to Buyer to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, each Seller
on behalf of itself and its Related Persons, hereby releases and forever
discharges WIMC, Buyer and the Corporation, and each of their respective past,
present and future officers, directors, representatives, Affiliates,
stockholders, successors and assigns (in their capacities as
such) (individually, a " _Released Party_ " and collectively, " _Released
Parties_ ") from any and all claims, demands, proceedings, causes of action,
Orders, obligations, Contracts, Indebtedness and Liabilities
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law
and in equity, which such Seller or any of such Sellers Related Persons now
has, have ever had or may hereafter have against the respective Released
Parties arising contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing Date or on
account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring
contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing Date, including any rights to
indemnification or reimbursement from any Released Party, whether pursuant to
their respective constituent documents, Contract or otherwise and whether or
not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date;
_provided_ that nothing contained herein shall operate to release any
obligations of Buyer arising under (a) that certain Indemnification Agreement
executed by the Corporation and the directors of the Corporation, dated March
29, 2007 (the " _Indemnification Agreement_ "), or any other obligation to
indemnify directors or officers set forth in (i) the Governing Documents of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) in any other agreement (collectively the " _D andO
Indemnification Obligations_") or (b) this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents including, but not limited to, the Sellers rights under _Article
10_. Each Seller on behalf of itself and its Related Persons hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any
Proceeding of any kind against any Released Party, based upon any
matter purported to be released hereby.

 



51 7.5 Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.

 

(a) Except as specifically provided in this _Section 7.5, (i)_ for a period
beginning on the Effective Date and ending with respect to the JAM Sellers,
18 months after the Closing Date, no JAM Seller shall (A) provide any
financing to any existing portfolio company of any of the JAM Sellers that
will be used to fund the servicing of HECM Loans in the United
States, including, without limitation, the development, marketing, selling or
other distribution of software processing or other technology products
relating to servicing HECM Loans (a " _JAM Restricted Business_ "), or (B)
make a new investment in any private Person that, as of the date of such
investment, engages in a JAM Restricted Business, including any entity listed
on _Schedule 7.5_ , or has the intention of engaging in a JAM Restricted
Business, and (ii) for a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending
with respect to the Sellers other than a JAM Seller, on the later of (A) 18
months after the Closing Date, and (B) the end of any non-compete provision of
any employment agreement between such Seller other than a JAM Seller and the
Corporation (in each case the " _Non-Compete Period_ "), no such Seller other
than a JAM Seller shall, nor shall any of such Sellers other than a JAM
Sellers controlled Affiliates directly or indirectly, engage in, assist
others in engaging in, or have an interest in any Person that engages in, or
knowingly encourage or facilitate another Person to engage in the origination
or servicing of HECM Loans in the United States, including, without
limitation, the development, marketing, selling or other distribution of
software processing or other technology products relating to HECM Loans (a "
_Restricted Business_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 7.5_ shall not operate to
prevent or restrict with respect to any Seller, any such Sellers or any
Affiliate of any such Sellers passive investment in capital stock or other
ownership interests of any Person traded on any national securities exchange,
if such Seller or Affiliate is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a
group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own
10% or more of any class of securities of such Person.

(c) For a period ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Sellers agree that none of the Sellers nor any of their controlled Affiliates
will, directly or indirectly, (i) induce, encourage or solicit any such
officer or employee to leave his or her position with Buyer, the Corporation
and/or any Subsidiary of WIMC or of the Corporation, as the case may be, or to
accept any other position with any other Person or (ii) induce, encourage or
solicit any such officer or employee to violate the terms of such officer or
employees employment Contracts, or any other employment arrangement, with
Buyer, the Corporation and/or any Subsidiary of WIMC or of the Corporation;
_provided_ that the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to (x) any
employee who had ceased to be employed by Buyer, the Corporation and any
Subsidiary of WIMC or of the Corporation at least six (6) months prior to any
such action by such Seller or its Affiliate or (y) any employee who responds
to general solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward Buyer,
the Corporation or any Subsidiary of WIMC, of the Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates. As used in this _Subsection 7.5(c)_, the term
"controlled Affiliate" when applied to the JAM Sellers shall mean an Affiliate
of a JAM Seller in which the JAM Seller owns greater than 50% of the voting
Equity Interest of such Affiliate or 50% or more of the board of such
Affiliate is designated by, or affiliated with, the JAM Seller.

 



 



52 (d) The Sellers acknowledge and agree that their obligations set forth in
this  _Section 7.5_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for the agreement of the Sellers in this _Section 7.5_, Buyer would not have
entered into this Agreement. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that
the undertakings of the Sellers in this _Section 7.5_ constitute an
independent covenant by each of the Sellers and shall not be affected by the
performance or nonperformance by any party hereto of any other term or
provision of this Agreement. Each Seller acknowledges that it has consulted
with its own counsel with regard to this _Section 7.5_ and, after such
consultation, agrees that the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_ are
reasonable and proper, have been negotiated fully and fairly and represent an
agreement based on the totality of the Contemplated Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the sole
consideration for the obligations set forth in this  _Section 7.5_ is the
agreement to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and no portion of the
Purchase Price is allocable to the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.5_.

 

7.6 Restated Financial Statements.

(a) On or before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause its accountants to
prepare and deliver to Buyer the following audited financial statements,
restated to conform to the GAAP requirements as applied by WIMC
(collectively, the " _Restated Financial Statements_ "): Audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and
2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, members equity and
comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows, including any required footnote
disclosures, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011
restated to reflect the HECM/HMBS issuances as financing transactions rather
than sales.

(b) During the period between the Effective Date and the Closing, on or before
the date that is ten (10) Business Days following each month ending after the
Effective Date, the Sellers shall cause the Corporation or its accountants to
deliver to Buyer a schedule in the form of __Annex A__ , reflecting the
calculation of operating income (except for the purposes of Annex A all
Transaction Expenses shall be excluded from such calculation) of the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries prepared on a consistent basis in accordance
with past practices for the year-to-date period ending on such prior month
end.

7.7 Refinancing. If WIMC engages in a transaction or series of related
transactions that constitute a refinancing of all or substantially all of the
Indebtedness outstanding under either the WIMC First Lien Credit Agreement or
WIMC Second Lien Credit Agreement (a " _Refinancing_ "), the issuer of each
Note and the Escrow Note shall pay the entire unpaid principal amount of each
Note and the Escrow Note then outstanding and all then accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, after giving effect to any reduction in the principal of the
Escrow Note in accordance with _Section 10.7(c)_, within ten (10) Business
Days of the completion of such Refinancing; provided that if a Refinancing
occurs prior to the release of the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, all amounts paid hereunder in respect of principal of the Escrow
Note will be deposited with the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account and all
amounts paid hereunder with respect to accrued and unpaid interest on the
Escrow Note shall be paid to the Sellers.

 



53 7.8 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

 

(a) Subject to the accuracy or the representations made in _Section 3.13_,
Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing
in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as provided in the Governing
Documents of such entities or otherwise in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Indemnification Agreement,
with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full
force and effect and that each of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on
its own behalf, will perform and discharge its obligations to provide such
indemnity and exculpation. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law,
such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and each of
the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall advance expenses in connection with
such indemnification as provided in such Governing Documents or its other
applicable agreements. The indemnification and liability limitation or
exculpation provisions of the Governing Documents of the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, as of the Closing Date or at any time prior to the
Closing Date, were directors, officers, employees or agents of any of the
Corporation of any of its Subsidiaries, unless such modification is required
by applicable Law.

 

(b) Contemporaneously with the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Corporation to,
and the Corporation shall, purchase and maintain in effect, without any
lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who are covered
by any directors and officers liability insurance policies of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of the Effective Date or
the Closing Date, for a period of four (4) years following the Closing Date
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing that is at least equal
to the coverage provided under the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable;
_provided_ that the Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does
not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing Date. 

(c) The directors, officers, employees and agents of each of the Corporation
and its Subsidiaries that are entitled to the indemnification, liability
limitation, exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 7.8_ are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.8_. This _Section
7.8_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the
Corporation.

 



54 7.9 Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act. Buyer shall be responsible
for any notice requirement or other obligation to any person under the
federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act or any similar state law
(" _WARN_ ") arising from or triggered by (a) the termination of employment of
any employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at the time of or
after Closing, or (b) Buyers decision not to retain any person employed by
the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing. So that Buyer
may evaluate any potential WARN issue, the Corporation shall prepare a list
of all terminations of employment by the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries within ninety (90) days preceding the Closing, including employee
name, date of termination, reason for termination, facility and operating
unit (the " _Termination List_ "). Conditioned upon the Termination List being
accurate in all material respects, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Seller Indemnified Party, from any and all Losses arising under
this _Section 7.9_ for which Buyer is responsible as set forth above,
including any Losses with respect to any former employees as listed on the
Termination List, any person employed by the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing and/or any person employed by Buyer after the
Closing.

have amended the terms of such Existing Financing Facilities in compliance
with such agreement and to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer,
effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent necessary for such Existing
Financing Facilities to continue as so amended on and after the Closing Date.

INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 General Indemnification.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article 10_, from and after the
Closing Date, the Sellers, severally and not jointly, hereby agree to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless WIMC and all of WIMCs Affiliates and each
of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, equityholders,
successors and assigns (each, a " _WIMC Indemnified Party_ " and,
collectively, the " _WIMC Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and
all Losses incurred or suffered by any WIMC Indemnified Party arising out of,
based upon or resulting from any of the following:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in or referred to
in _Article 3_ (other than the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 3.15_), _Article 4_ or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf
of any Seller or the Corporation pursuant to _Section 9.1_;

 

(ii) any breach by any Seller or the Corporation of, or any failure of any
Seller or the Corporation to perform, any of the covenants, agreements or
obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement; or

(iii) any Excess Transaction Expenses (to the extent not deducted from the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Article 2_ ).

(b) Subject to the provisions of this  _Article 10_, from and after the
Closing Date, WIMC hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Seller and their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, equityholders, successors and assigns
(each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, based upon or
resulting from any of the following:

 



58 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in or referred to
in  _Article 5_ or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of WIMC
pursuant to _Section 9.2_;

(ii) any breach by Buyer of, or any failure of Buyer to perform, any of the
covenants, agreements or obligations contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement; or

(iii) any Business operations conducted after the Closing.

(c) If a Person entitled to indemnification under this _Article 10_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall incur or suffer any Losses in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under this _Article 10_ against the
Person(s) required to provide indemnification under this _Article 10_
(collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall
assert a claim for indemnification by promptly providing a written notice
(the " _Notice of Loss_ ") to the Indemnifying Party (or in the case of any
notice required to be given to a Seller, to the Sellers Representative)
stating, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis of such Notice of Loss.
The Notice of Loss shall be provided to the Indemnifying Party as soon as
practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware that it has incurred or
suffered a Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to _Section 10.2_,
any failure to provide the Indemnifying Party with a Notice of Loss, or any
failure to provide a Notice of Loss in a timely manner as aforesaid, shall not
relieve any Indemnifying Party from any Liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party under this  _Section 10.1_ except to the extent that the
ability of such Indemnifying Party to defend such claim is materially
prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such Notice of Loss. If
the Notice of Loss relates to a Third Party Claim, the procedures set forth
in _Section 10.1(d)_ shall be applicable. If the Notice of Loss does not
relate to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)
days from the date of receipt of such Notice of Loss to object to any of the
subject matter and any of the amounts of the Losses set forth in the Notice of
Loss, as the case may be, by delivering written notice of objection thereof to
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to send a notice of
objection to the Notice of Loss within such 30 day period, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have agreed to the Notice of Loss and shall be
obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the portion of the amount specified
in the Notice of Loss to which the Indemnifying Party has not objected. If
the Indemnifying Party sends a timely notice of objection, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to settle (without an obligation to settle) such claim for
indemnification. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party do not
settle such dispute within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Partys
receipt of the Indemnifying Partys notice of objection, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek enforcement of their
respective rights under this _Article 10_.

 



59 (d) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the assertion
of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a third
party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which the Indemnified Party
shall seek indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall so notify in
writing the Indemnifying Party, but subject to _Section 10.2_ any failure so
to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party under this _Section
10.1_ except to the extent that the ability of the Indemnifying Party to
defend the Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to give such notice. In no event shall the Indemnified Party
admit any Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim or settle,
compromise, pay or discharge such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect to any such claim as to which
the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to assume the defense (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) of any such
claim through counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party by notifying the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of such notice from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
that any such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party (at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to employ counsel to
represent it at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if there are one or
more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from
or additional to those available to any Indemnifying Party or if there is
otherwise a potential conflict between the interests of the Indemnified Party
and any Indemnifying Party, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of
such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party agrees to render to the other parties such assistance as
may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of any such claim, which assistance shall include, to the extent
reasonably requested by a party, the retention, and the provision to such
party, of records and information reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees of the other party available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
materials provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise, or
offer to settle or compromise, or otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless such
settlement includes only the payment of monetary damages (which are fully paid
by the Indemnifying Party), does not impose any injunctive or equitable relief
upon the Indemnified Party, does not require any admission or acknowledgment
of liability or fault of the Indemnified Party and contains an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. Neither the
Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates may settle, compromise, or offer
to settle or compromise, or otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim for
which the Indemnifying Party may have a Liability under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



60 (e) With respect to any claim as to which the Indemnifying Party shall have
acknowledged in writing the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify
the Indemnified Party hereunder, after written notice by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of the election by the Indemnifying Party to
assume control of the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party hereunder for any costs or
fees subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except if the Indemnified Party has the right to employ
counsel to represent it at the expense of the Indemnifying Party as set forth
in _Section 10.1(d)_. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the notice required pursuant to _Section
10.1(d)_ as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend such claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the
reasonable cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The party controlling
the defense of any Third Party Claim shall in any event defend any such
matters vigorously and in good faith.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
10.1_, to the extent there is any inconsistency between this _Section
10.1(e)_ and _Section 10.5_ as to any Tax Claim, _Section 10.5_ shall
control.

10.2 Survival. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date
(the " _General Survival Date_ "), except that (i) the representations and
warranties made in _Sections 3.1_ ,  _3.3, 3.22_ , _4.1_ , _4.3_ and _4.5_
and the first sentence of _Section 3.2(a)_ (and any corresponding
representations made in the certificates delivered by the Corporation and the
Sellers pursuant to  _Section 9.1_) (collectively, the " _Seller Fundamental
Representations_ ") and _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_ (and any corresponding
representations made in the certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to 
_Section 9.2_) (the " _WIMC Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive for
a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date and (ii) the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 3.15_ and Section _3.18_ (and any
corresponding representations made in the certificates delivered by the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.1_) shall survive until the date that is sixty
(60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(after giving effect to any extensions or waivers). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any representation or warranty (and the indemnification obligations
of the parties hereto with respect thereto) that would otherwise terminate in
accordance with this _Section 10.2_ will continue to survive if good faith
written notice (including reasonable detail and reasonable specificity, to the
extent known, as to nature and amount) for indemnification shall have been
given in accordance with this _Article 10_ on or prior to such termination
date, until such claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise
resolved as provided herein. Neither the Buyer nor the Sellers shall have any
liability with respect to claims first asserted in connection with any
representation or warranty after the applicable survival period specified
therefor in this _Section 10.2_. All covenants and agreements in this
Agreement will terminate on the Closing Date other than those covenants
and agreements which by their terms are to be performed after the Closing
Date, which in each case shall survive until fully performed; _provided that_
, nothing herein shall prevent WIMC and its permitted assignees, on the one
hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, from making any claim hereunder, or
relieve WIMC or its permitted assignees, or the Sellers from any liability
hereunder, after such time for any breach thereof.

 



61 10.3 Limitation on Liability.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 10.3(c)_, the Sellers shall not have any liability
pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(i)_ or pursuant to _Section 10.4_ for any
Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
$1,500,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which event the Sellers shall be
liable for indemnification pursuant to  _Section 10.1(a)(i)_ or pursuant to
_Section 10.4_ for the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeding $375,000
(the " _Deductible_ "), including the Threshold Amount, up to but not
exceeding (i) $9,000,000 with respect to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)(i)_, plus (ii) $5,000,000 with respect to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.4_ (the " _Indemnity Cap_ "). In addition, the Sellers shall
not have any liability pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.4_
for any Losses with respect any individual matter in which the amount of
Losses claimed is less than $10,000, and any such Losses shall not be included
in any analysis of whether the Threshold Amount or the Deductible Amount has
been exceeded.

(b) Subject to  _Section 10.3(d)_, Buyer shall not have any liability
pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ for any Losses unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Threshold Amount, in which
event Buyer shall be liable for indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.1(b)(i)_ for the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeding the
Deductible Amount, including the Threshold Amount, up to but not exceeding the
Indemnity Cap. In addition, the Buyer shall not have any liability pursuant
to _Section 10.1(a)(i)_ for any Losses with respect any individual matter in
which the amount of Losses claimed is less than $10,000, and any such Losses
shall not be included in any analysis of whether the Threshold Amount or the
Deductible Amount has been exceeded.

(c) The limitations on liability set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ shall not
apply with respect to Losses resulting from (i) any breach of any of the
Seller Fundamental Representations, or (ii) fraud or willful misrepresentation
with respect to (x) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article 3_ or _Article 4_ or (y) any certificate delivered by or on behalf
of Sellers or pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

(d) The limitations on liability set forth in _Section 10.3(b)_ shall not
apply with respect to Losses resulting from (i) any breach of any of the WIMC
Fundamental Representations or the covenant and agreement set forth in
_Section 7.9_ or (ii) fraud or willful misrepresentation with respect to (x)
any breach of a representation or warranty contained in _Article 5_ or (y)
any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to _Section
9.2_.

(e) In calculating the amount of the Losses to any Indemnified Party, such
Losses shall be reduced by (i) any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses from any third party (including
insurance proceeds) and (ii) any Tax savings or Tax benefit (for the avoidance
of doubt, net of any tax detriment arising from indemnification) that is
actually realized by such Indemnified Party or an Affiliate thereof as a
result of the fact or circumstances giving rise to the Losses. Such
Indemnified Party will provide a calculation of such Tax savings or Tax
benefit in reasonable detail; provided that no Tax Returns or other supporting
information will be provided by such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) Sellers shall not have any
liability pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.4_ for Losses to the
extent such Losses are attributable to any additional Liabilities, including
Tax Liabilities, that arise due to the restatement of the Corporation\'s
financial statements pursuant to _Section 7.6_, or to the extent such Losses
are due to (1) Buyers breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements herein and/or (2) actions and inactions of Buyer or
its Affiliates which constitute willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence and (y) Sellers shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section
10.1_ for Losses to the extent such Losses are shown as expressly reserved on
the Corporations financial statements prior to the Closing Date.

 



62 (f) The indemnification obligations hereunder of any Indemnifying Party shall
be subject to a duty on the part of the Indemnified Party to mitigate to the
extent required by Law any Loss of which the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified party shall be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement in
respect of any Loss to the extent such Person (or any of its Affiliates) has
been previously indemnified or reimbursed in respect of such Loss pursuant to
any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents.

 

10.4 Tax Indemnity.

(a) Subject to _Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_, from and after the Closing
Date, the Sellers, severally and not jointly, hereby agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the WIMC Indemnified Parties from and against any of
the following:

(i) any liability for Taxes with respect to any taxable period of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessors) for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ ");

(ii) any liability for Taxes with respect to the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date;

(iii) any Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from any breach of
(A) any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.15_ (relating to
Taxes) or (B) any covenant set forth in _Section 6.1(b)(xv)_; and

(iv) any and all liability (as a result of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or otherwise) for Taxes of Seller or any other person (other than
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) which is or has ever been affiliated
with Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or with whom Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been
required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date;

provided, in the case of clauses (i) through (iv) above, Sellers shall be
liable only to the extent that such Taxes or other liabilities exceed the
amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes or liabilities (excluding any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) on the Latest Balance Sheet, as such reserved amount is adjusted
for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with past
custom and practice of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries in filing their
Tax Returns and taking into account the results of the operations of the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries from the date of the Latest Balance
Sheet through the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party
pursuant to this _Section 10.4_ shall terminate at the close of business on
the sixtieth (60th) day following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to
any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

 



63 (c) In the case of any taxable period that begins on or before and ends after
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of Taxes allocable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed
to be:

(i) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and

(ii) In the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as franchise
Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon
occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount
of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

For purposes of this _Section 10.4(c)_, any item determined on an annual or
periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the
Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period.

10.5 Tax Claims.

(a) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority either (i) relating to
any Pre-Closing Period or (ii) which, if successful, might result in an
indemnity payment to the Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.6_ (including any Tax
Claims described in _Section 10.5(d)_), then the Buyer shall give notice to
the Sellers Representative in writing of such claim and of any counterclaim
the Indemnified Party proposes to assert (each a " _Tax Claim_ "); provided,
however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to any a Pre-Closing Period,
Sellers Representative shall, solely at Sellers cost and expense, control
all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax
Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing,
may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with
respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed
and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest
the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers Representative shall not settle such Tax Claim without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and Buyer, and counsel of its own choosing,
shall have the right to participate fully, at its sole cost and expense, in
all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if it reasonably
determines that such Tax Claim could have a material adverse impact on the
Taxes of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in a taxable period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date.

 



64 (c) Sellers Representative and Buyer shall jointly control and participate in
all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of
the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, and shall
bear their own respective costs and expenses. Neither Sellers Representative
nor Buyer shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent
of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(d) Buyer shall control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating
to a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date.
Sellers Representative, and counsel of its own choosing, shall have the
right to participate at its sole cost and expense in all aspects of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if Sellers Representative reasonably
determines that such Tax Claim could result in Sellers having an obligation
to indemnify Buyer for all or a portion of such Tax Claim pursuant to _Section
10.4_, and Buyer shall not settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written
consent of Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

10.6 Payment.

 

(a) Upon a determination of liability under this _Article 10_, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the
amount so determined within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of such
determination. If there should be a dispute as to the amount or manner of
determination of any indemnity obligation owed under this Agreement the
Indemnifying Party shall nevertheless pay when due such portion, if any, of
the obligation that is not subject to dispute. Subject to _Section 10.7_,
upon the payment in full of any claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person, firm,
corporation or other entity with respect to the subject matter of such claim.

(b) Any items as to which any WIMC Indemnified Party is entitled to payment
under this Agreement shall be paid to such WIMC Indemnified Party first
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (first from the then
outstanding principal amount of the Escrow Note, and second from any funds on
deposit in the Escrow Account), to the extent that such amounts are sufficient
to pay such items, and then from the Sellers directly. The responsibility
for payment of any items as to which any WIMC Indemnified Party is entitled
under _Sections 10.1(a)_ or _Section 10.4_ (up to the Indemnity Cap except
in the case of payments covering Losses resulting from (i) any breach of
any of the Seller Fundamental Representations or (ii) fraud or willful
misrepresentation with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty
contained in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ or in any certificate delivered by or
on behalf of Sellers or pursuant to _Section 9.1_) shall be borne by the
Sellers pro rata in accordance with the Sellers respective percentage
interests as set forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules,
whether or not, in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty, all
Sellers made such representation or warranty.

 



65 10.7 Escrow. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall, pursuant to the provisions of 
_Section 2.4_, deliver to the Escrow Agent, as agent of Buyer, the Escrow
Note, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
which will be executed at the Closing. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow
Note in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement, which shall, among other things, provide that, (a) any
interest that becomes due and payable under the Escrow Note will be paid to
the Sellers Representative, and will not be held by the Escrow Agent,
whether or not there are any pending claims for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article 10_, (b) any claims for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 10_ shall first be satisfied from the then outstanding principal
amount of the Escrow Note and second from any funds in the Escrow Account and
(c) any amount by which the Escrow Note is reduced in satisfaction of a claim
pursuant to this _Article 10_  shall be used to reduce the principal of the
Escrow Note; provided, however, that the amounts payable under the Escrow Note
and funds in the Escrow Account shall not be paid to the Sellers
Representative to the extent that the then-remaining principal amount of the

such filing is necessary to comply with law or for consistency with past or
existing procedures, practices and accounting methods.

 



67 11.2 Cooperation. Sellers, the Corporation, each of Corporations
Subsidiaries and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other

for any Pre-Closing Period or (ii) for which Sellers have indemnified the
Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.4_, in each case, shall be for the account of
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such refunds of Taxes shall be

(determined on a marginal basis) to the carryback of any item relating to a
taxable period that begins after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Period_
") of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items, of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates,
including Buyer).

Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Sellers and Buyer. Each
party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party
entitled to receive the refund, the amount of such refund (net of any costs
incurred to obtain such refund and net of any income Taxes of Buyer, the
Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries attributable to the receipt of such
refund or credit) within ten (10) days after such refund is received.

payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
law.

or tax sharing agreements (excluding any agreement the primary purpose of
which is not the sharing, allocation of, or indemnity for, any Tax and in
which such provisions regarding Tax are typical of such agreements) with
respect to each of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to be terminated as of
the Closing Date, and shall ensure that such agreements are of no further
force or effect as to any of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries on and after
the Closing Date and that there shall be no further liabilities or obligations
imposed on any of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries under any such
agreements.

filing, recordation, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including
any penalties and interest with respect thereto) incurred or payable, if any,
resulting directly from the transactions contemplated under the Transaction

Sellers and one half (1/2) by the Buyer, when due and the party primarily or
customarily responsible under applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns

shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
12.1(e)_ if any Seller or the Corporation is then in material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

(ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, statements,

shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction from all of the
Sellers, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Sellers.
The Corporation and Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Sellers Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of every Seller.

shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State

transactions of the type provided for in this Agreement shall be selected by
each of the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative within a further fifteen
(15) days and those two arbitrators shall mutually agree upon a third

to the arbitration hearing as follows: (a) exchange of witness lists and
copies of documentary evidence and documents relating to or arising out of
the issues to be arbitrated, (b) depositions of all party witnesses and (c)

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any present or future rule
of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected
in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Contemplated Transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

13.9 Table of Contents; Headings. The table of contents and the headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

13.10 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
if the signatures hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall
become effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or scanned
pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to
this Agreement.

13.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided_ , that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the date on which the Confidentiality
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



74 13.12 Specific Performance. Each of the Sellers, the Buyer and the Corporation
agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the other
parties shall, except as set forth in _Section 10.9_ with respect to the

specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity.
