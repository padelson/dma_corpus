Second Step Effective Time (as defined below), the separate corporate
existence of the Interim Surviving Entity shall cease and FCB shall continue,
as the surviving corporation of the Second Step Merger, as a corporation
chartered under the laws of the State of North Carolina (FCB in such capacity

and the Interim Surviving Entity shall duly execute and deliver articles of
merger for filing with the North Carolina Secretary of State (the " _Second
Step NC Articles of Merger_ ") and a certificate of merger for filing with the

electronic exchange of documents at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date
which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable law) of all the conditions set forth in Article

unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by CIT and
BancShares. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

1.4 _Conversion of CIT Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of BancShares, CIT or the holder of
any securities of BancShares or CIT:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of CIT issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _CIT Common Stock_ "), except for shares of CIT Common Stock owned
by CIT or BancShares (in each case other than shares of CIT Common Stock (i)
held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned
by third parties or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by CIT or BancShares in
respect of debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.06200 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") of the Class A common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
BancShares (the " _BancShares Class A Common Stock_").

(b) All the shares of CIT Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ," it being
understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall be deemed
to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of CIT Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of CIT Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) a New Certificate representing the number of whole shares of
BancShares Class A Common Stock which such shares of CIT Common Stock have
been converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional
shares which the shares of CIT Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2, in each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior
to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of BancShares Class A Common
Stock, the Class B common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of BancShares (the
'' _BancShares Class B Common Stock_," and together with the BancShares Class
A Common Stock, the " _BancShares Common Stock_ ,") or CIT Common Stock shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or reverse
stock split, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio
to give BancShares and the holders of CIT Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that
nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit CIT or
BancShares to take any action with respect to its securities or otherwise that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of CIT Common Stock that are owned by CIT or
BancShares (in each case other than shares of CIT Common Stock (i) held in
trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held
in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties
or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by CIT or BancShares in respect of debts
previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
BancShares Class A Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

1.5 _BancShares Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
BancShares Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
BancShares and shall not be affected by the Merger. 1.6 _CIT Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of BancShares, CIT or the holder of any
securities of BancShares or CIT:

(a) Each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT (" _CIT Series A Preferred
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive a share of a newly
created series of preferred stock of BancShares having such rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions,
taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to the holders
thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and
limitations and restrictions, taken as a whole, of the CIT Series A Preferred
Stock (taking into account that CIT will not survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any adjustment to the right of
optional redemption by BancShares that is reasonably necessary to obtain Tier
1 Capital treatment from the Federal Reserve Board for such preferred stock)
(all shares of such newly created series, collectively, the " _New BancShares
Series B Preferred Stock_ ") and, upon such conversion, the CIT Series A
Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

(b) Each share of 5.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B,
par value $0.01 per share, of CIT (" _CIT Series B Preferred Stock_ ," and
together with the CIT Series A Preferred Stock, the " _CIT_ _Preferred Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive a share of a newly
created series of preferred stock of BancShares having such rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions,
taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to the holders
thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and
limitations and restrictions, taken as a whole, of the CIT Series B Preferred
Stock (taking into account that CIT will not survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any adjustment to the right of
optional redemption by BancShares that is reasonably necessary to obtain Tier
1 Capital treatment from the Federal Reserve Board for such preferred stock)
(all shares of such newly created series, collectively, the " _New BancShares
Series C Preferred Stock_ ," and together with the New BancShares Series B
Preferred Stock, the " _New BancShares Preferred Stock_ ") and, upon such
conversion, the CIT Series B Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time.

1.7 _Treatment of CIT Equity Awards_

(a) CIT RSU Awards. Except as otherwise agreed between BancShares and CIT,
each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of CIT Common Stock,
including any deferred restricted stock unit award (each, a " _CIT RSU Award_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than a
CIT Director RSU Award (as defined below) shall, at the Effective Time,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a number of restricted stock units in respect of
shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock equal to the product (with the
result rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of
CIT Common Stock subject to each such CIT RSU Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time determined based on target level performance (to the extent
applicable) multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each converted award shall
in all other respects be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms, payment timing and rights to receive dividend equivalents)
applicable to the existing CIT RSU Award under the applicable equity plan and
award agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) CIT Director RSU Awards. Except as otherwise agreed between BancShares and
CIT, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of CIT Common Stock
that (i) is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) is held by a member of the CIT Board of Directors, (iii) will
automatically vest upon the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and
(iv) is not subject to a deferral election (each, a " _CIT Director RSU Award_
"), shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the number of shares of CIT
Common Stock subject to such CIT Director RSU Award, less applicable Tax
withholding, which shall be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date and in no event later than five (5) days following
the Closing Date.

(c) CIT Performance Unit Awards. Except as otherwise agreed between BancShares
and CIT, each performance unit award in respect of shares of CIT Common Stock
(a " _CIT Performance Unit Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a number
of restricted stock units in respect of shares of BancShares Class A Common
Stock equal to the product (with the result rounded up to the nearest whole
share) of (i) the number of shares of CIT Common Stock subject to each such
CIT Performance Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
determined based on target level performance multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. Each converted award shall in all other respects be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including rights to receive dividend equivalents)
applicable to the existing CIT Performance Unit Award under the applicable
equity plan and award agreement as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that vesting shall be subject only to continued
service of the holder through each applicable final performance date and shall
not be subject to any performance goals or metrics following the Effective
Time.

(d) The CIT Board of Directors (or appropriate committee with delegated
authority therefrom) shall take such action (including, if appropriate,
amending the terms of the CIT Group Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ")) as is necessary to ensure that (i) the offering period in effect
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final Offering_ ") shall end at least
five business days prior to the Closing Date, (ii) each individual
participating in the Final Offering shall receive notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement no later than fifteen days prior to the Closing
Date, (iii) each ESPP participant's accumulated contributions under the ESPP
shall be refunded to such participant as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time and shall not be used to purchase shares of CIT Common Stock,
and (iv) the ESPP shall terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time and no
further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, CIT, the Board of Directors of CIT and the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors of CIT, as applicable (or
appropriate committee with delegated authority therefrom), shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7.

1.8 _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $$0.0001
per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective
Time be converted into and become one share of common stock, no par value, of
the Interim Surviving Entity.

1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger and the Second Step
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted
as a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code.

1.10 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Second Step Merger, CIT Bank,
National Association, a wholly owned Subsidiary of CIT (" _CIT Subsidiary
Bank_ "), will merge with and into FCB (the " _Bank Merger_ "). FCB shall be
the surviving entity in the Bank Merger (FCB in such capacity as the surviving
corporation of the Bank Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Bank_ ") and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate
existence of CIT Subsidiary Bank shall cease. Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, FCB and CIT Subsidiary Bank will enter into an agreement and plan
of merger in form and substance agreed by BancShares and CIT, which shall be
customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger_
_Agreement_ "). Each of BancShares and CIT shall approve the Bank Merger
Agreement and the Bank Merger as the sole stockholder of FCB and CIT
Subsidiary Bank, respectively, and BancShares and CIT shall, and shall cause
FCB and CIT Subsidiary Bank, respectively, to, execute certificates or
articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary
to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") immediately
following the Second Step Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall become
effective at such time and date as specified in the Bank Merger Agreement in
accordance with applicable law, or at such other time as shall be provided by
applicable law.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _BancShares to Make Consideration Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, BancShares shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company mutually agreed upon by BancShares and CIT, which BancShares and
CIT agree in advance may be BancShares' customary stock transfer agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article II for the
benefit of the holders of Old Certificates (which for purposes of this Article
II shall be deemed to include certificates or book-entry account statements
representing shares of CIT Preferred Stock), certificates or, at BancShares'
option, evidence in book-entry form, representing shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock and/or
New BancShares Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and
Section 1.6, respectively (collectively, referred to herein as " _New_
_Certificates_ "), and cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such cash and New Certificates, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of BancShares Class A Common
Stock or New BancShares Preferred Stock payable in accordance with Section
2.2(b), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, BancShares and CIT shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates
representing shares of CIT Common Stock or CIT Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive BancShares Class A Common Stock or New BancShares
Preferred Stock, as applicable, pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates
representing the number of whole shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares or shares of New BancShares Preferred
Stock, as applicable, which the shares of CIT Common Stock or CIT Preferred
Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any
dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). CIT shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent such information
regarding the record holders of CIT Common Stock and CIT Preferred Stock which
is reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as
specified herein. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) (A) a New Certificate representing that
number of whole shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock to which such holder
of CIT Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Article I and (B) a check representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or (ii) (A) a New
Certificate representing that number of shares of New BancShares Preferred
Stock to which such holder of CIT Preferred Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and (B) a check representing the
amount of any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or
distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the number of whole shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock or
shares of New BancShares Preferred Stock which the shares of CIT Common Stock
or CIT Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to BancShares
Class A Common Stock or New BancShares Preferred Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the
surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the whole shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock or
shares of New BancShares Preferred Stock that the shares of CIT Common Stock
or CIT Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of BancShares Class A Common
Stock or New BancShares Preferred Stock is to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof
that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of
BancShares Class A Common Stock or New BancShares Preferred Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of CIT of the shares of CIT Common Stock or CIT Preferred Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of BancShares Class A
Common Stock or New BancShares Preferred Stock, as applicable, as provided in
this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BancShares Class A
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old
Certificates (or in satisfaction of the obligations set forth in Section 1.7
in respect of CIT Equity Awards), no dividend or distribution with respect to
BancShares Class A Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of BancShares.
In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, BancShares shall pay to
each former holder of CIT Common Stock or any CIT Equity Awards who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-
sale prices of BancShares Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq as reported by The
Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of twenty (20) full trading
days ending on and including the business day that is two (2) business days
immediately prior to the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after
taking into account all shares of CIT Common Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of BancShares Class A Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4 or Section 1.7. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately
bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of CIT for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to BancShares. Any former holders of CIT Common Stock or CIT Preferred
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to BancShares for payment of the shares of BancShares Class A Common
Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the BancShares Class A Common Stock deliverable in respect of
each former share of CIT Common Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, or the shares of New BancShares Preferred Stock and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the New BancShares Preferred Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of CIT Preferred Stock such holder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of BancShares, CIT, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of CIT Common Stock or CIT Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. BancShares and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon the stock transfer books and records of CIT to establish the
identity of those entitled to receive shares of BancShares Class A Common
Stock or BancShares Preferred Stock or any other amounts issuable or payable
in accordance with this Agreement, which books and records shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute regarding the ownership of CIT
Common Stock or CIT Preferred Stock, BancShares and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock or
BancShares Preferred Stock or any other amounts issuable or payable in
accordance with this Agreement in escrow with an independent third party and
shall thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims or liability with
respect thereto.

(g) BancShares shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
BancShares Class A Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of CIT Common Stock, CIT Preferred Stock or
CIT Equity Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
BancShares or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of CIT Common Stock, CIT Preferred
Stock or CIT Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding
was made by BancShares or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
BancShares or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as BancShares or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of BancShares Class
A Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, or the shares of New
BancShares Preferred Stock, as applicable, deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

(iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article III to the extent it is

statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), CIT hereby represents and warrants to the
BancShares Parties as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

(a) CIT is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a bank holding company duly
registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC
Act_ "). CIT has the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate
all its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. CIT engages in activities and holds properties only of the types
permitted to bank holding companies by the BHC Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. CIT is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing, qualification or
standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or
to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CIT. As used in
this Agreement, the term " _Material_ _Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect
to the BancShares Parties, CIT or the Surviving Bank, as the case may be, any
effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development
(including such effect, change, event circumstance, condition, occurrence or
development with respect to any matter whether or not pending as of the date
of this Agreement that causes such matter (even if not a Material Adverse
Effect previously) to constitute a Material Adverse Effect thereafter) that,
either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed
to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations (including the Pandemic Measures) of general applicability to
companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate,
or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries (including any such changes arising out of the
Pandemic), (D) changes, after the date hereof, resulting from hurricanes,
earthquakes, tornados, floods or other natural disasters or from any outbreak
of any disease or other public health event (including the Pandemic), (E)
public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly
required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of
the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(F) a decline in the trading price of a party's common stock or the failure,
in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial
forecasts, but not, in either case, including any underlying causes thereof;
except, with respect to subclause (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the
effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to similar companies in the
banking industry) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Pandemic_ " means any outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics relating to SARS-
CoV-2 or COVID-19, or any evolutions or mutations of thereof, or any other
viruses (including influenza), and the governmental and other responses
thereto; the term " _Pandemic Measures_ " means any quarantine, "shelter in
place", "stay at home", workforce reduction, social distancing, shut down,
closure, sequester or other directives, guidelines or recommendations
promulgated by any Governmental Entity, including the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, in each case, in
connection with or in response to the Pandemic; and the term " _Subsidiary_ "
when used with respect to any person, means any subsidiary of such person
within the meaning ascribed to such term in either Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC or the BHC Act. True and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation of CIT, as amended (the " _CIT Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") and the amended and restated bylaws of CIT, as amended (the
" _CIT Bylaws_ "), in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
have previously been made available by CIT to the BancShares Parties.

(b) Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CIT, each Subsidiary of CIT
(a " _CIT Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified
to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in
good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing and
(iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There
are no restrictions on the ability of CIT or any Subsidiary of CIT to pay
dividends or distributions except, in the case of CIT or a Subsidiary that is
a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all similarly regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of CIT that is an insured depository institution are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit
Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or
threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the CIT Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all Subsidiaries of CIT that would constitute
"significant subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X
of the SEC as of the date hereof, as well as each such Subsidiary's
jurisdiction of incorporation, organization, or formation and CIT's and/or a
CIT Subsidiary's percentage ownership of each such Subsidiary. There is no
person whose results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders'
equity or financial position are consolidated in the financial statements of
CIT other than the CIT Subsidiaries. Neither CIT nor any CIT Subsidiary is in
violation, in any material respect, of its respective certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, or other organizational or governing documents.

of or ownership interest in CIT or any its Subsidiaries, or contracts,
commitments, understandings or arrangements by which CIT or any its
Subsidiaries may become bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock

issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any of the
foregoing (collectively, " _CIT Securities_ ", and any of the foregoing in
respect of Subsidiaries of CIT, collectively, " _CIT Subsidiary_ _Securities_
"). Other than CIT Equity Awards, no equity-based awards (including any cash
awards where the amount of payment is determined, in whole or in part, based
on the price of any capital stock of CIT or any of its Subsidiaries) are
outstanding. There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or
other agreements in effect to which CIT or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
with respect to the voting or transfer of CIT Common Stock, capital stock or

any liens, claims, title defects, mortgages, pledges, charges, encumbrances
and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable (except, with respect to Subsidiaries that are depository

with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.

Agreement, and the CIT Subsidiary Bank has full corporate power and authority

its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by CIT, the performance by CIT of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly approved by the Board of Directors of CIT. The Board of Directors of
CIT has determined that the consummation of the transactions contemplated

Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors of CIT Subsidiary Bank and CIT as

transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by CIT and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the BancShares Parties) constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of CIT, enforceable against CIT in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,

(b) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by CIT,
nor the execution, delivery, or performance of the Bank Merger Agreement by

CIT or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clauses
(x) and (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults that,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on CIT.

United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and
except where the failure to timely file (or furnish, as applicable) such
report, form, correspondence, registration or statement or to pay such fees
and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CIT. As of their respective
dates, such reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, and
other filings, documents, and instruments were complete and accurate and
complied with all applicable laws, in each case, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a

material fees and assessments due and payable in connection with such reports,
forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, and other filings,
documents, and instruments. Subject to Section 9.14, except for normal
examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of CIT and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or
has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of CIT, investigation into the
business or operations of CIT or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1,

have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CIT.

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

(a) The financial statements of CIT and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the CIT Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of CIT and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial position of CIT and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end
audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of CIT and its Subsidiaries have since December 31, 2017, been, and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements, except as would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on CIT. Since December 31, 2017, no independent public
accounting firm of CIT has resigned (or informed CIT that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of CIT as a result
of or in connection with any disagreements with CIT on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CIT, neither CIT nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for
those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of CIT included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2020 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since June 30, 2020, or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of CIT and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership of CIT or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CIT. CIT (x) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and (f), respectively, of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to
ensure that material information relating to CIT, including its Subsidiaries,
is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
of CIT by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to CIT's outside auditors
and the audit committee of CIT's Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect CIT's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in CIT's internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to CIT's auditors and audit
committee and true, correct and complete copies of such disclosures have been
made available by CIT to the BancShares Parties. There is no reason to believe
that CIT's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2018, (i) neither CIT nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of CIT, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of CIT or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of CIT or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that CIT or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no employee of or attorney representing CIT or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by CIT or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws or banking laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by CIT or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of CIT or any committee thereof or the Board of Directors or similar
governing body of any CIT Subsidiary or any committee thereof, or to the
knowledge of CIT, to any director or officer of CIT or any CIT Subsidiary.

3.7 _Broker 's Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Keefe, Bruyette
and Woods, Inc. and Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, neither CIT nor any CIT Subsidiary
nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees,
commissions or finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. CIT has disclosed to the BancShares Parties as
of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the
engagement by CIT of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. and Morgan Stanley and Co.
LLC related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since December 31, 2019, there has not been any effect, change, event,
circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on CIT.

(b) Since December 31, 2019, CIT and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "ordinary course," with respect to either
party, shall take into account the commercially reasonable actions taken by
such party and its Subsidiaries in response to the Pandemic and the Pandemic
Measures.

3.9 _Legal and Regulatory Proceedings_.

(a) Subject to Section 9.14, except as would not reasonably be expected to,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
CIT, neither CIT nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are
no outstanding or pending or, to the knowledge of CIT, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against CIT or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers
or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) Subject to Section 9.14, there is no material injunction, order, judgment,
decree, or regulatory restriction imposed upon CIT, any of its Subsidiaries or
the assets of CIT or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would apply to BancShares or
any of its affiliates).

3.10 _Taxes_.

(a) Each of CIT and its Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed or caused to be
timely filed, taking into account any extensions, all U.S. federal income Tax
Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it and such

attributable to interest or exchange rate changes. Except as would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on CIT, each swap, cap, floor, option agreement, future and
forward contract and other similar derivative transactions and risk management
arrangements (each a " _Derivative Transaction_ "), which CIT or any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into for its own account, or which the CIT or any of
its Subsidiaries has agreed to enter into for their own account, was or will

statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (ii) Liens for real property
Taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) easements, rights of way, and other
similar encumbrances of record that do not materially affect the value or use
of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties and (iv) such
nonmonetary imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens (other than
leases or other occupancy agreements) as do not materially affect the value or

conducted. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CIT: (a) (i) to
the knowledge of CIT, the use of any Intellectual Property by CIT and its
Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the rights
of any person and is in accordance with any applicable license pursuant to
which CIT or any CIT Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual
Property, and (ii) since December 31, 2017, no person has asserted in writing
to CIT that CIT or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or

ARTICLE IV 



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BANCSHARES PARTIES

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the BancShares
Parties to CIT concurrently herewith (the " _BancShares Disclosure Schedule_
"); _provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii)
the mere inclusion of an item in the BancShares Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
the BancShares Parties that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of
Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections
of Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as
disclosed in any BancShares Reports filed by BancShares since December 31,
2016, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), the BancShares Parties hereby represent and warrant to CIT as
follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

(a) BancShares is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act. BancShares has the corporate power and
authority to own, lease or operate all its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. BancShares engages in activities
and holds properties only of the types permitted to bank holding companies by
the BHC Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. BancShares
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated
by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on BancShares. True and complete copies of the (i)
restated certificate of incorporation of BancShares, as amended (the "
_BancShares Certificate of Incorporation_ ") (ii) amended and restated bylaws
of BancShares (the " _BancShares Bylaws_ "), (iii) articles of incorporation
of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub_ _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), (iv)
bylaws of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ "), (v) articles of
incorporation of FCB (the " _FCB Articles of Incorporation_ "), and (vi)
bylaws of FCB (the " _FCB Bylaws_ "), in each case as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the BancShares
Parties to CIT.

(b) Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BancShares, each Subsidiary
of BancShares (a " _BancShares Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership, leasing or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing and (iii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of BancShares or any Subsidiary of BancShares to
pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of BancShares or a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all similarly regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of BancShares that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all
premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are
pending or threatened. Section 4.1(b) of the BancShares Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of BancShares that
would constitute "significant subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the SEC as of the date hereof, as well as each such
Subsidiary's jurisdiction of incorporation, organization, or formation and
BancShares' and/or a BancShares Subsidiary's percentage ownership of each such
Subsidiary. There is no person whose results of operations, cash flows,
changes in stockholders' equity or financial position are consolidated in the
financial statements of BancShares other than the BancShares Subsidiaries.

material respect, of its respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or
other organizational or governing documents.

BancShares Parties, collectively, " _BancShares Subsidiary Securities_ "). No
equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of a
BancShares Party or any of their Subsidiaries) are outstanding. There are no
voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect

or other equity ownership interests of each of the BancShares Subsidiaries,
free and clear of any Liens, and all such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized

Subsidiaries that are depository institutions, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §
55) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof.

"), and the approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors of
FCB and BancShares as FCB's sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of any BancShares Party are necessary to approve this Agreement or

duly and validly executed and delivered by each BancShares Party and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by CIT) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each BancShares Party, enforceable against each

any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and except where the failure to

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on BancShares. As of their respective dates, such
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, and other
filings, documents, and instruments were complete and accurate and complied
with all applicable laws, in each case, except as would not reasonably be

forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, and other filings,
documents, and instruments. Subject to Section 9.14, except for normal

initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of BancShares,
investigation into the business or operations of BancShares or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2018, except where such proceedings or
investigations would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on BancShares. Subject to

Effect on BancShares _._

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

(a) The financial statements of BancShares and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the BancShares Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of BancShares and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial position of
BancShares and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared

except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of BancShares and its Subsidiaries have since December
31, 2017, been, and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on BancShares. Since December 31, 2018, no independent
public accounting firm of BancShares has resigned (or informed BancShares that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
BancShares as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
BancShares on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on BancShares, neither BancShares
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of BancShares included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2020
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2020, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of BancShares and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership of BancShares or
its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BancShares. BancShares (x)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and (f),
respectively, of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to BancShares, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of BancShares by others
within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to BancShares'
outside auditors and the audit committee of BancShares' Board of Directors (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
BancShares' ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in BancShares'
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to BancShares' auditors and audit committee and true,
correct and complete copies of such disclosures have previously been made
available by BancShares to CIT. There is no reason to believe that BancShares'
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2018, (i) neither BancShares nor any of its Subsidiaries,

accountant or representative of BancShares or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of BancShares or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that BancShares or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee of or
attorney representing BancShares or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by BancShares or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws or banking laws, breach of fiduciary

their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of BancShares or any committee thereof or the Board of Directors or
similar governing body of any BancShares Subsidiary or any committee thereof,
or to the knowledge of BancShares, to any director or officer of BancShares or
any BancShares Subsidiary.

Companies, neither BancShares nor any BancShares Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. BancShares has disclosed to CIT as of the date
hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by
BancShares of Piper Sandler Companies related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereunder.

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since December 31, 2019, there has not been any effect, change, event,
circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a

and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes are pending.

be included as a prospectus. BancShares and CIT, as applicable, shall use
reasonable best efforts to make such filings within thirty (30) days of the
date of this Agreement. Each of BancShares and CIT shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filings, and to keep the S-4 effective for
so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and BancShares and CIT shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint
Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders. BancShares shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or

contemplated by this Agreement, and CIT shall furnish all information
concerning CIT and the holders of CIT Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary

them within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger, the Second Step Merger, and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. BancShares and CIT shall
have the right to review for a reasonable period of time in advance, and, to
the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to CIT or BancShares, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity,
including the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 and any other filing made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein, and each party shall
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences, in each case subject to applicable law. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Requisite_ _Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean
all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders and approvals (and the
expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof)
(i) from FINRA, the Federal Reserve Board or the relevant Federal Reserve
Banks acting under delegated authority pursuant to the BHC Act and Regulations
W and Y, and pursuant to Regulation K and Section 25A of the Federal Reserve
Act (to establish an Edge Act corporation to own the foreign subsidiaries of
CIT), the FDIC pursuant to the Bank Merger Act and FDI Act, the Antitrust
Division of the US Department of Justice, and the North Carolina Commissioner
of Banks pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 53C-7-201 to 53C-7-209; and (ii) set
forth in Section 3.4 or Section 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger, the Second
Step Merger, and the Bank Merger) or those the failure of which to be obtained
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on BancShares or the Surviving Bank.

(c) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any request
for information and resolve any objection that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to require any BancShares Party or CIT or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, to, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities or
third parties, take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on BancShares or the Surviving Bank (assuming for this purpose
that the Surviving Bank consists of FCB and CIT and their respective
Subsidiaries taken as a whole) (a " _Materially_ _Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ "), provided that the sale of one or more branches of BancShares or
CIT in a geographic banking market shall not constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there would be, a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition.

(d) The BancShares Parties and CIT shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4
or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
BancShares, CIT or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger, the Second Step Merger, the Bank Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) The BancShares Parties and CIT shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, or
that the receipt of any such approval will be delayed. 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to Section 9.14, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws (including the Pandemic Measures), each of BancShares, FCB, Merger Sub,
and CIT, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger, the Second Step Merger, and the other
matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information
technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party
in preparing to execute after the Effective Time the conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each of BancShares, FCB, Merger Sub, and CIT shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents that the BancShares Parties or CIT, as the case may be, is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law), (ii) the information set forth on
Section 6.2(a) of the CIT Disclosure Schedule and (iii) all other information
concerning its business, properties, assets, liabilities and personnel as such
party may reasonably request. No BancShares Party nor CIT nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of the BancShares Parties' or CIT's, as the case may be, customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties), contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or to the extent that the BancShares Parties or CIT, as the case may
be, reasonably determines, in light of Pandemic or the Pandemic Measures that
such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any of its employees.
The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of BancShares, FCB, and Merger Sub on one hand, and CIT on the other
hand, shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party
or parties, as applicable, or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated June 8, 2020, between BancShares and CIT (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the operations of the other parties prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the parties shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

6.3 _Stockholders ' Approvals_.

(a) Each of BancShares and CIT shall call a meeting of its stockholders (the "
_BancShares Meeting_ " and the " _CIT Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the
purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite CIT Vote and the Requisite BancShares
Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and (b) if so
desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily
brought before a meeting of stockholders in connection with the approval of a
merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and each of CIT and
BancShares shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. Such meetings
may be held virtually, subject to applicable law and the organizational
documents of each party. Subject to Section 6.3(b), each of BancShares and CIT
and their respective Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from the stockholders of BancShares and CIT, as applicable, the
Requisite BancShares Vote and the Requisite CIT Vote, as applicable, including
by communicating to the respective stockholders of BancShares and CIT its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement) that, in the case of BancShares, the stockholders of BancShares
approve this Agreement (the " _BancShares Board_ _Recommendation_ "), and in
the case of CIT, that the stockholders of CIT approve this Agreement (the "
_CIT_ _Board Recommendation_ "), and each of BancShares and CIT and their
respective Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the BancShares Board Recommendation, in the case of BancShares, or the CIT Board Recommendation, in
the case of CIT, (ii) fail to make the BancShares Board Recommendation, in the
case of BancShares, or the CIT Board Recommendation, in the case of CIT, in
the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of
the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through (iv), a "
_Recommendation Change_ ") or (v) execute or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.12(a) entered into in compliance with
Section 6.12(a)) providing for an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, prior to the receipt of the Requisite BancShares
Vote, in the case of BancShares, or the Requisite CIT Vote, in the case of
CIT, each of the Boards of Directors of BancShares and CIT may submit this
Agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall constitute a Recommendation Change), in which event such Board
of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to its
stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), if (i)(A) such Board of Directors has received an Acquisition
Proposal, which it believes in good faith, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal (in which event, subject to
compliance with this Section 6.3(b), the Board of Directors of CIT may cause
CIT to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and the Board of
Directors of BancShares may cause BancShares to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(g)) or (B) an Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii)
such Board of Directors, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in
good faith that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result
in a violation of its fiduciary duty under applicable law, in each case, if,
but only if, (1) BancShares and CIT, as applicable, have complied in all
material respects with Section 6.12, (2) BancShares or CIT, as applicable,
delivers to the other party at least four (4) business days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, and furnishes to the other party
a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is
taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal, a copy of the proposed transaction
agreement(s) and all other documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal),
(3) prior to taking such action, BancShares or CIT, as applicable, negotiates,
and causes its financial, legal, and other advisors to negotiate, in good
faith with the other party, during the four (4) business day period following
BancShares' or CIT's, as applicable, delivery of the notice referred to in
such sub-clause (2) above (to the extent the party receiving such notice
desires to so negotiate), and (4) after the conclusion of such four (4)
business day period, the Board of Directors of BancShares or CIT, as
applicable, determines in good faith, after giving effect to all of the
adjustments (if any) which may be offered by the other party pursuant to sub-
clause (3) above, that, in the case of actions described in clause (i)(A)
above, such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
and in case of actions described in either clause (i)(A) or clause (i)(B)
above, it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the
BancShares Board Recommendation or the CIT Board Recommendation, as applicable
(it being agreed that, if such actions are being taken in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, in the event that, following delivery of the notice
referred to in sub-clause (2) above, there is any material revision to the
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including, any revision in price, the four
(4) business day period during which the parties agree to negotiate in good
faith shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2)
business days remain to negotiate subsequent to the time BancShares or CIT, as
applicable, notifies the other party of any such material revision (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions)). As used in this Agreement,
the term " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, change, effect,
development, condition, circumstance or occurrence that (I) improves or would
be reasonably likely to improve the business, financial condition or results
of operations of BancShares and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or CIT and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable, (II) is not known by or
reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of BancShares or the Board of
Directors of CIT, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement and (III)
does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal, the end or reduction of the
Pandemic or the lifting or expiration of the Pandemic Measures; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither of the following shall be considered
or taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred: (x) changes in the trading price or trading volume of the CIT Common
Stock (it being understood that the underlying cause of such change may be
taken into account to the extent not otherwise excluded by this definition),
or (y) the fact alone that BancShares or CIT, as applicable, meets or exceeds any internal or published forecasts or
projections for any period (it being understood that the underlying cause of
such over-performance by BancShares or CIT, as applicable, may be taken into
account to the extent not otherwise excluded by this definition).

(c) Notwithstanding any Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been
terminated, the BancShares Meeting and CIT Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of BancShares and CIT at such
meetings for the purpose of the stockholders of BancShares and CIT considering
and voting on approval of this Agreement and any other matters required to be
approved by the stockholders of BancShares and CIT in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, unless this
Agreement has been terminated, neither BancShares nor CIT shall submit to or
for a vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Each of BancShares and CIT shall adjourn or postpone the BancShares
Meeting and CIT Meeting, as applicable, if (i) as of the date of such meeting
there are insufficient shares of common stock of BancShares or CIT, as
applicable, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute the
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, (ii) as of the date
of such meeting BancShares or CIT, as applicable, has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary for the approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of BancShares or CIT, as applicable, or (iii)
required by applicable law in order to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the
stockholders of BancShares or CIT, as applicable, a reasonable amount of time
prior to such meeting; _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii),
neither BancShares nor CIT shall be required to adjourn or postpone the
BancShares Meeting and CIT Meeting, as applicable, (x) more than two (2) times
or (y) more than ten days for any one postponement or adjournment or more than
20 days in the aggregate.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of the BancShares Parties and CIT shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly
with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger, the Second Step Merger, and the Bank
Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by CIT or the BancShares Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Second Step Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) to
obtain the tax opinions referenced in Section 7.2(c) and Section 7.3(c),
including by executing and delivering representations contained in
certificates of officers of BancShares, FCB, and CIT reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to BancShares' and CIT's counsel.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_.

(a) BancShares shall cause the shares of BancShares Class A Common Stock and
New BancShares Series C Preferred Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

(b) To the extent requested by BancShares, prior to the Effective Time, CIT
shall cooperate with BancShares and use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws
and the rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Entity of CIT securities from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
CIT securities under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Commencing on the Effective Time and ending on December 31 of the year in
which the Closing occurs (and including any later payments in respect of such
period), BancShares shall provide employees of CIT and its Subsidiaries who at
the Effective Time become employees of BancShares or its Subsidiaries (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with the following compensation and benefits: (i) a
base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than
the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash and equity-based
short-term and long-term incentive compensation or bonus opportunities
(including sales incentives) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than the short-term and long-term incentive compensation or bonus
opportunities (including sales incentives), in the aggregate, provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that (x) BancShares may
make any incentive compensation or bonus opportunities (or any portion
thereof) referred to in this clause (ii) payable in cash in lieu of equity and
(y) CIT shall deliver to BancShares at least ten (10) business days prior to
the Closing Date a schedule setting forth the amounts for each of the elements
of compensation set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) for each Continuing
Employee), and (iii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Promptly after the date hereof, CIT and
BancShares shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the CIT
Benefit Plans and BancShares Benefit Plans with a view towards determining
appropriate benefit plans and programs with respect to continuing employees of
CIT and BancShares (" _Surviving Bank Benefit Plans_ "), which Surviving Bank
Benefit Plans will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and among other
things, treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent
basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic
location, tenure, qualifications and abilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
CIT and BancShares agree that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time until the second anniversary of the Closing, each Continuing Employee who
is involuntarily terminated will be provided with the severance benefits that
otherwise would have been payable to such employee, after giving effect to
service crediting described in Section 6.6(b), under the CIT Employee
Severance Plan, as amended and restated effective July 1, 2017. Following the
second anniversary of the Closing, each Continuing Employee shall be eligible
to participate in and receive severance benefits under those Surviving Bank
Benefit Plans of the Surviving Bank in which similarly situated employees of
the Surviving Bank are eligible to participate (after giving effect to service
crediting described in Section 6.6(b)).

(b) For purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual
(except not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits) under the BancShares Benefit Plans, CIT Benefit Plans and any
Surviving Bank Benefit Plans, service with or credited by BancShares, CIT or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or predecessors for Continuing Employees
or continuing employees of BancShares or its Subsidiaries shall be treated as
service with BancShares to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous CIT Benefit Plan or BancShares Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time. With respect to any CIT Benefit Plan, BancShares
Benefit Plan or Surviving Bank Benefit Plan in which any employees of
BancShares or CIT (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Bank or BancShares shall: (i) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under the analogous BancShares Benefit Plan or CIT Benefit Plan, as the case
may be, and (ii) provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time (or, if later, prior to the time such employee commenced participation in
any Surviving Bank Benefit Plan) under any BancShares Benefit Plan or CIT
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous CIT or BancShares Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any CIT Benefit Plan,
BancShares Benefit Plan or Surviving Bank Benefit Plan in which such employee
first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

(c) BancShares and FCB hereby acknowledge that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall constitute a "change in control," "change of control"
or term or concept of similar import of CIT and its Subsidiaries under the
terms of the CIT Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, BancShares
or FCB agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all BancShares Benefit
Plans and CIT Benefit Plans.

(d) If requested by BancShares in a writing delivered to CIT not less than the
earlier of (x) ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement and (y) ten
(10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of CIT (or
the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the CIT Group
Inc. Savings Incentive Plan (the " _CIT 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the
day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time. If BancShares requests that the CIT 401(k) Plan be terminated,
(i) CIT shall provide BancShares with evidence that such plan has been
terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable
review and comment by BancShares) not later than two (2) days immediately
preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the Continuing Employees shall be eligible
to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by BancShares or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _BancShares
401(k) Plan_ "), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation
in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. BancShares and CIT shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to
the CIT 401(k) Plan and/or the BancShares 401(k) Plan, to permit the
Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the BancShares 401(k)
Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash or notes (in the case of loans),
in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such employee
from the CIT 401(k) Plan.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of BancShares or CIT or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Bank, CIT, BancShares or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Bank, CIT,
BancShares or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate
the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of BancShares or
CIT or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. For the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing
Employee shall be an employee at will. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any CIT Benefit Plan, BancShares
Benefit Plan, Surviving Bank Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any particular CIT Benefit Plan, BancShares Benefit Plan,
Surviving Bank Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former
employee, officer, director or consultant of BancShares or CIT or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Bank or BancShares shall
indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each
case to the extent (subject to applicable law) such persons are indemnified as
of the date of this Agreement by CIT pursuant to the CIT Certificate of
Incorporation, the CIT Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of
any Subsidiary of CIT and any indemnification agreements in existence as of
the date hereof and disclosed in Section 6.7(a) of the CIT Disclosure
Schedule, each present and former director, officer or employee of CIT and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _CIT_ _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of CIT or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of
advancement of expenses, any CIT Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such CIT Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Bank
or BancShares shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by CIT ( _provided_ ,
that the Surviving Bank or BancShares may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Surviving
Bank nor BancShares shall be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an
amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by CIT for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums
for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the
Surviving Bank or BancShares shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance which, in such entity's good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, BancShares or CIT, in consultation with, but only upon
the consent of BancShares, may (and at the request of BancShares, CIT shall
use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a
six (6)-year "tail" policy under CIT's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) The obligations of the Surviving Bank, CIT or BancShares under this
Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a
manner so as to adversely affect any CIT Indemnified Party without the prior
written consent of the affected CIT Indemnified Party. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each CIT
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Bank or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all its assets
or deposits to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in
each such case, the Surviving Bank will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Bank will expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of BancShares, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of CIT, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving
Bank or BancShares with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
Second Step Merger, or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by BancShares.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. The BancShares Parties, on one hand, and CIT, on the
other hand, shall each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change,
event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i) that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a __ condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that
any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to
any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9
or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or
noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

6.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. The BancShares Parties, on one hand, and CIT,
on the other hand, shall give the other party prompt notice of any stockholder
litigation against such party or its directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall give the other party
the opportunity to participate (at such other's party's expense) in the
defense or settlement of any such litigation. The BancShares Parties, on one
hand, and CIT, on the other hand, shall give the other the right to review and
comment on all filings or responses to be made by such party in connection
with any such litigation, and will in good faith take such comments into
account. The BancShares Parties, on one hand, and CIT, on the other hand,
shall not agree to settle any such litigation without the other party's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ , that the other party shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of such party
and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief
after the Effective Time upon the Surviving Bank, BancShares, or any of their
affiliates.

6.11 _Corporate Governance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of BancShares shall take all actions necessary to cause, effective
as of the Effective Time, the Boards of Directors of the Surviving Bank and
BancShares to consist, as of the Effective Time, of fourteen (14) directors
(i) eleven (11) of whom shall be persons designated by BancShares and (ii)
three (3) of whom shall be persons designated by CIT. The eleven (11)
directors designated by BancShares shall be selected from among the current
directors of BancShares as of the date hereof, and the three (3) directors
designated by CIT shall be selected from among the current directors of CIT as
of the date hereof, which shall include Ellen R. Alemany.

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, have or participate in any discussions with
any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet,
letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (whether
written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.12)
in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the receipt of the Requisite BancShares Vote, in the case of BancShares, or
the Requisite CIT Vote, in the case of CIT, a party receives an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this
Section 6.12, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal
if, but only if, the board of directors of such party concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such actions would more likely than not
result in a violation of its fiduciary duty under applicable law, and subject
to providing twenty four (24) hours' prior written notice of its decision to
take such action to CIT or BancShares, as applicable, and identifying the
person making the Acquisition Proposal and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to
furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided
pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on
terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with such party. Each party will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than CIT or BancShares, as applicable, with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and will withdraw and terminate access
that was granted to any person (other than to CIT or BancShares, as
applicable, and their respective affiliates and Representatives) to any "data
room" (virtual or physical) that was established in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition to the obligations
set forth above, each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours)
advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information or inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), will provide the other party with an unredacted copy of
any such Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other
materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised, on a current basis, of the
continuing status thereof, including the material terms and conditions thereof
and any material changes thereto, and shall provide to the other party copies
of any written materials received by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As
used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, with respect to
BancShares or CIT, as applicable, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any offer, proposal, solicitation or inquiry relating to, or
any third-party indication of interest in, or the filing of any regulatory
application or notice, from or by any person relating to, (i) any acquisition
or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party,
(ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a
party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
party, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of the consolidated assets of the party. As used in this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
which the board of directors of BancShares or CIT, as applicable, determines,
in good faith, after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, and
other aspects of such proposal (including the amount, form, and timing of
payment of consideration, the financing thereof, any associated break-up or
termination fees, including those provided for in this Agreement, expense
reimbursement provisions, and all conditions to consummation) and the person
making the proposal, and after consulting with its financial advisor (which
shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm) and outside legal counsel, is (i) more favorable from a
financial point of view to BancShares' or CIT's, as applicable, stockholders
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) reasonably
likely to be timely consummated on the terms set forth; _provided_ , _however_
, that for purposes of this definition of Superior Proposal, references to
"twenty-five percent (25%) or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "seventy-five percent (75%) or more."

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.13 _Public Announcements_. CIT and BancShares agree that the initial press
release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties
agrees that no public release or announcement or statement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by
applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental
Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the
other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on,
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance or (ii) for such
releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such
releases, announcement or statements made after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with this Section 6.13.

6.14 _Change of Method_. CIT and BancShares shall be empowered, upon their
mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or structure of effecting the combination of CIT and BancShares
(including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ , that if
the structure of effecting the combination of CIT and BancShares set forth in
Article I would result in the failure to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals on a timely basis to permit the Closing Date to occur on or before
the Termination Date (despite the parties hereto using their reasonable best
efforts), then BancShares and CIT shall revise the structure of effecting the
combination of CIT and BancShares set forth in Article I such that (a) at the
Effective Time, CIT shall be merged with and into BancShares, with BancShares
continuing as the surviving entity and (b) immediately following such merger,
CIT Subsidiary Bank shall be merged with and into FCB, with FCB continuing as
the surviving entity _provided_ , _further_ , that no such change shall (i)
alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of BancShares Class
A Common Stock received by holders of CIT Common Stock in exchange for each
share of CIT Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of CIT's
stockholders or BancShares' stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of CIT or BancShares pursuant to this
Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties
agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement
executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.1.

6.15 _Takeover Restrictions_. None of CIT, the BancShares Parties or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Restriction to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the
Second Step Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger, the Second Step Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Restriction now or hereafter
in effect. If any Takeover Restriction may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members
of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Restriction on any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability
of any such Takeover Restriction.

6.16 _Treatment of CIT Indebtedness_. Upon the Effective Time, BancShares
and/or BancShares Bank shall assume the due and punctual performance and
observance of the covenants to be performed by CIT under the agreements set
forth on Section 6.16 of the CIT Disclosure Schedule (including the Senior and
Subordinated Notes) to the extent set forth in such agreements. In connection
therewith, BancShares and CIT shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts
to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, officer's certificates or
other documents, and the parties hereto shall cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof, required to
make such assumption effective as of the Effective Time and obtain the
consents of the holders of such indebtedness to the extent such consent is
required under the documents governing such indebtedness.

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. CIT and BancShares agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain CIT Insiders, both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that CIT Insiders not
be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of shares of CIT Common Stock and CIT Preferred Stock into shares
of BancShares Class A Common Stock and New BancShares Preferred Stock in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of this Section 6.17. CIT shall __ deliver to BancShares in a
reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information
regarding those officers and directors of CIT subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _CIT Insiders_ "),
and the Board of Directors of BancShares and of CIT, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in
any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required
to cause (in the case of CIT) any dispositions of CIT Common Stock, CIT
Preferred Stock or CIT Equity Awards by the CIT Insiders, and (in the case of
BancShares) any acquisitions of BancShares Class A Common Stock or New
BancShares Preferred Stock by any CIT Insiders who, immediately following the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be officers or directors of
BancShares subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

6.18 _Railcar Tape_. CIT shall deliver to the BancShares Parties an updated
Railcar Tape that is true, correct and complete in all material respects
within ten (10) business days after the end of each calendar month between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, and on the first such delivery date, CIT
shall deliver to the BancShares Parties, true correct and complete copies of
all lease agreements entered into by CIT or any of its Subsidiaries, as
lessor, providing for the lease of Railcars.

6.19 _CIT Ex-United States Subsidiaries Structuring Transactions_. In
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and unless
adjusted by either (a) the reasonable determination of BancShares, with the
prior written consent of CIT (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or (b) mutual written consent of BancShares and CIT, one or more to-
be-formed merger or acquisition Subsidiaries of a to-be-formed Edge Act
Corporation Subsidiary (the " _Edge Act Subsidiary_ ") of FCB shall enter into
one or more merger or equity purchase transactions with the ex-United States
Subsidiaries of CIT, whether or not incorporated, through which the ex-United
States Subsidiaries of CIT will become Subsidiaries of the Edge Act
Subsidiary, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement. In
connection therewith, BancShares and CIT shall cooperate with each other and
use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any agreements and plans of
merger, stock purchase agreements, or other documents, which are necessary or
advisable to consummate such transactions, with the timing of such
transactions to be reasonably determined by BancShares, whether prior to, at,
or after the Effective Time.

6.20 _Certain Additional Structuring Transactions_. In connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if BancShares reasonably
determines, with the prior written consent of CIT (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), that (a) one or more Subsidiaries of CIT or
(b) any assets of CIT or any Subsidiaries of CIT are either (x) not able to be
held by FCB or a Subsidiary of FCB after consummation of the Merger or (y)
able to be held by FCB or a Subsidiary of FCB after consummation of the Merger
but such holdings would be materially adverse to BancShares or FCB, then
BancShares may direct that, in each case, such Subsidiaries or assets shall be
transferred to either BancShares or a Subsidiary of BancShares designated by
BancShares, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement. In
connection therewith, BancShares and CIT shall cooperate with each other and
use reasonable __ best efforts to execute and deliver any agreements and plans
of merger, stock purchase agreements, or other documents, which are necessary
or advisable to consummate such transactions, with the timing of such
transactions to be reasonably determined by BancShares, whether prior to, at,
or after the Effective Time. ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of the BancShares Parties and CIT;

(b) by either the BancShares Parties or CIT if any Governmental Entity that
must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger,
the Second Step Merger, or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final
and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction, decree or other legal
restraint or prohibition permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger, the Second Step Merger, or the
Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein;

(c) by either the BancShares Parties or CIT if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before October 15, 2021 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either the BancShares Parties or CIT ( _provided_ , that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there
shall have been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or
any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or
warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of
CIT, in the case of a termination by the BancShares Parties, or the BancShares
Parties, in the case of a termination by CIT, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the BancShares
Parties or CIT as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, and none of the BancShares Parties, CIT, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Section 6.2(b) (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.13 (Public
Announcements), this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination
of this Agreement and Section 4 of the Voting Agreement shall survive
termination of this Agreement as contemplated therein.

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of CIT or shall have been made directly to the stockholders
of CIT or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least
two (2) business days prior to the CIT Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case with respect to CIT and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either the BancShares Parties or CIT pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
without the Requisite CIT Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 were satisfied or were capable of
being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by the BancShares Parties pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (B) prior
to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, CIT
enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as
that referred to above), then CIT shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay BancShares, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal
to $64,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent
(50%)."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by CIT pursuant to Section
8.1(f) or by the BancShares Parties pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then CIT shall
pay BancShares, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within
two (2) business days of the date of termination.

(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of BancShares or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of BancShares or any person shall have publicly announced (and
not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the BancShares Meeting)
an Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to BancShares and (A) (x)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either the BancShares Parties or
CIT pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite BancShares Vote having
been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2 were satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such
termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by CIT pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the
date of such termination, BancShares enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then BancShares
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and
the date of consummation of such transaction, pay CIT the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same-day funds; _provided_ , that for purposes of this
Section 8.2(c)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to
"twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the BancShares Parties
pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or by CIT pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then
BancShares shall pay CIT, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination
Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination.

(d) In no event shall either party be required to (i) pay the Termination Fee
more than once or (ii) pay the Termination Fee and be subject to a claim for
liabilities or damages from the other party hereto.

(e) Each of the BancShares Parties and CIT acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if BancShares or CIT,
as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the
costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys' fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit. In addition, if BancShares or CIT, as the case
may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then
such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on
which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the
date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on
the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full. The Termination Fee and other amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and, except in the case of
fraud, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the BancShares Parties and CIT in
the event this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances described in
Section 8.2 pursuant to which the Termination Fee is payable.

ARTICLE IX 



GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after the receipt of
the Requisite BancShares Vote or the Requisite CIT Vote; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the receipt of the Requisite BancShares Vote or the
Requisite CIT Vote, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of BancShares or CIT, as applicable, any amendment of this
Agreement that requires such further approval under applicable law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to

condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement (or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) shall

costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

9.6 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in

limitation." The word "or" shall not be exclusive. References to "the date
hereof" shall mean the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the

CIT listed on Section 9.6 of the CIT Disclosure Schedule, and the "
_knowledge_ " of BancShares means the actual knowledge of any of the officers

other schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this
Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. Nothing contained
herein shall require any party or person to take any action in violation of
applicable law (including the Pandemic Measures).

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when __ counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including and together with the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the CIT Disclosure Schedule, the BancShares
Disclosure Schedule and the other documents and instruments referred to
herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

9.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of
law principles.

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the
State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 9.5.

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

9.11 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in
contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as otherwise provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

9.12 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties' obligation to consummate the Merger and the Second
Step Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) except in the case of fraud, if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances described in Article VIII that
require payment of the Termination Fee, a party's right to receive payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Sections 8.1 or 8.2 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of such party or any other person, whether or not this
Agreement has been terminated and all other remedies (including equitable
remedies and the remedies set forth in Section 9.12(a)) are waived against the
party paying the Termination Fee and any of its affiliates for any and all
losses, damages and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with this
Agreement and upon payment of the Termination Fee the paying party and its
affiliates shall have no further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than as provided in Sections 5(i) and 5(j) of the Voting Agreement) and (ii)
except with respect to claims for willful breach, bad faith or fraud, the sole
recourse under this Agreement to any party for a breach of this Agreement or
any provision hereof by the other party shall be a claim for actual monetary
damages which shall not exceed a cap of $64,000,000 and such cap shall be
reduced by any Termination Fee paid for any reason by the breaching party.

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.14 _Confidential Supervisory Information_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall
be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would involve
the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including confidential
supervisory information as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as identified
in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8)) of a Governmental Entity by any party to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable
law. For purposes of clarity, a representation relating to receipt of
regulatory approvals on a timely basis shall not be given, or continue to be
given, to the extent the reason for it no longer continuing to be accurate
involves such confidential supervisory information. To the extent legally
permissible, appropriate substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or
taken under circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding sentences
apply.

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

[Signature Page Follows] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date
first above written.
