right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), (i) the number
of GSME Shares that will constitute the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted downward so that the aggregate value thereof, at an assumed value of
$10.00 per share, equals the 2010 Actual Net Income multiplied by 15.0,
rounded to the nearest whole share, and (ii) the number of GSME Shares to be
delivered to the Plastec Shareholders set forth in Sections 1.3(a)(i) and
(ii), and each reference to the Earnout Shares or portions thereof set forth
in Section 1.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall be similarly
proportionally adjusted downward.

 

 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding GSME Shares are changed into a different number of shares or
different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend,
extraordinary cash dividend, or dividend payable in any other securities
occurs or is declared with a record date within such period, or any similar
event occurs, the Merger Consideration to be delivered to the Plastec
Shareholders on the Closing Date shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
the Plastec Shareholders with the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

immediately succeeding Fiscal Year to be earned in full by the Plastec
Shareholders if Merged Plastec achieves the applicable Net Income Target in
such immediately succeeding Fiscal Year or in part as determined by the
application of the Pro-rating Mechanism if Merged Plastec comes within the

Shares; and provided further that if, as a result of the Pro-rating
Mechanism, there are 2011 Earnout Shares and/or 2012 Earnout Shares that have
not been earned, the Pro-rating Mechanism as applied to the 2013 Net Income
Target shall treat the deferred 2011 Earnout Shares and the deferred 2012
Earnout Shares in the same manner as the 2013 Earnout Shares.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If the 2011 Net Income of Merged Plastec is less than eighty percent
(80%) of the 2011 Net Income Target, all of the 2011 Earnout Shares will be
deferred to Fiscal Year 2012 and added to the amount of 2012 Earnout Shares
and, subject to the remainder of this paragraph, will be earned in full if
Merged Plastec achieves the 2012 Net Income Target for Fiscal Year 2012 or
earned in part as determined by the Pro-rating Mechanism (if triggered in
accordance with this Section 1.8). If the 2012 Net Income of Merged Plastec
is less than eighty percent (80%) of the 2012 Net Income Target, all of the
2012 Earnout Shares will be deferred to Fiscal Year 2013 and added to the
amount of 2013 Earnout Shares and will be earned in full if Merged Plastec
achieves the 2013 Net Income Target for Fiscal Year 2013 or earned in part as
determined by the Pro-rating Mechanism (if triggered in accordance with this
Section 1.8); provided, however, that if the Net Income of Merged Plastec is
less than eighty percent (80%) of both the (x) the 2011 Net Income Target and
(y) the 2012 Net Income Target in the relevant Fiscal Years, then all of the
2011 Earnout Shares and the 2012 Earnout Shares shall be deferred and added
to the amount of 2013 Earnout Shares, with all such Earnout Shares being
earned in full if Merged Plastec achieves the 2013 Net Income Target or
earned in part as determined by the Pro-rating Mechanism (if triggered in
accordance with this Section 1.8). At the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2013, the
Plastec Shareholders shall be entitled to be issued the Earnout Shares that
are earned pursuant to this Section 1.8, if any, based upon Merged Plastec's
Fiscal Year 2013 Net Income, and no further Earnout Shares shall be issued to
the Plastec Shareholders.

 

 

(d) The Pro-rating Mechanism, as applied to each Plastec Shareholder
individually, will be calculated as follows:

Solely for purposes of illustration, an example of the foregoing is set forth
in Schedule 1.8.

 



 

(e) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the audit report on Merged
Plastec's financial statements for the Fiscal Years ending April 30 of 2011,
2012 and 2013, Merged Plastec shall deliver to the GSME Committee (as defined
in Section 1.10) and the Shareholders' Committee (as defined in Section 1.11)
a notice (each a "Notice") setting forth (i) Merged Plastec's Net Income for
such Fiscal Year, (ii) the number of Earnout Shares that shall be issued
pursuant to the terms of Section 1.8(a) through (d) as a result of Merged
Plastec's Net Income in such Fiscal Year and (iii) the allocation thereof to
each Plastec Shareholder pursuant to the terms of Section 1.8(a), (b) and
(d). Unless the GSME Committee or the Shareholders' Committee disagrees with
the Notice, each shall counter-sign such Notice and deliver it to GSME, which
shall take all necessary actions so that any Earnout Shares that have been
earned by the Plastec Shareholders are immediately issued. If either the GSME
Committee or the Shareholders' Committee disagrees with the Notice, the
Parties shall attempt to resolve such dispute by voluntary settlement. If a
voluntary settlement is reached within thirty (30) days after the date on
which the GSME Committee and the Shareholders' Committee have received the
Notice, the GSME Committee, the Shareholders' Committee and Merged Plastec
shall execute a revised Notice with the agreed upon figures and GSME shall
take all necessary actions so that any Earnout Shares that have been earned
by the Plastec Shareholders are immediately issued. If the GSME Committee and
the Shareholders' Committee cannot resolve a dispute prior to the expiration
of thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice, then the dispute shall be
submitted (at the direction of either the GSME Committee, the Shareholders'
Committee or both) for arbitration as provided for in Section 11.13 hereof.
The arbitrator shall render a decision within ninety (90) days of being
appointed and such decision and award ("Decision") shall be in writing (with
copies delivered to Merged Plastec, the GSME Committee and the Shareholders'
Committee) and shall be final and conclusive on GSME, the GSME Committee and
the Shareholders' Committee and, promptly after receiving a copy of the
Decision, GSME shall take all necessary actions so that any Earnout Shares
that have been earned by the Plastec Shareholders are immediately issued.
Each approved and executed Notice or Decision shall be referred to as a
"Final Notice." All fees and costs of such arbitrator shall be borne by
GSME.

(f) The number of Earnout Shares issuable to the Plastec Shareholders
pursuant to this Section 1.8 shall be proportionately increased or decreased,
or subject to such other adjustment, in the event of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or
a stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend or dividend payable in any
other securities is declared prior to such Earnout Shares being issued, as
may be necessary or appropriate so that the Earnout Shares or other
consideration issued to the Plastec Shareholders with respect to achieving
any Net Income Target shall provide the Plastec Shareholders with the same
economic and other benefits of ownership as the Plastec Shareholders would
have received if the number of Earnout Shares issued with respect to
achieving such Net Income Target had been issued to the Plastec Shareholders
at Closing.

 

 

1.9 Indemnity Escrow. To provide a contingent fund for the payment
of amounts, if any, due to GSME pursuant to the indemnity obligations of
the Insiders and the Investors set forth in Article VIII, at the Closing,
ten percent (10%) of the GSME Shares ("Indemnity Escrow Shares") to be
issued and delivered to the Insiders and the Investors pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i) at the Closing (the "Escrow Fund") shall be deposited into escrow,

bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by Plastec and Plastec does not know of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union or other labor organization to organize any

sheets of Plastec included in the Financial Statements. Plastec has good,
valid and marketable title to the real property owned by it, and except as

exceptions, variances, reservations, covenants or other title defects or
limitations of any kind, other than liens for Taxes (as defined in Section

under any of such leases, any existing material default or event of default
of Plastec or, to Plastec's Knowledge, with respect to any other party (or
any event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material default), except where the lack of such validity and effectiveness
or the existence of such default or event of default would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Plastec.

thereto with material obligations thereunder is in breach of or in default
under, and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a breach of or default under, any Plastec Contract, and no party
to any Plastec Contract has given any written notice of any claim of any such
breach, default or event, which, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Plastec. Each Material
Plastec Contract that has not expired or been terminated by its terms is in
full force and effect, subject to all of the terms and conditions of each
such Material Plastec Contract, and except as may be further limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

liability, general comprehensive liability and product liability insurance

Policies are to Plastec's Knowledge adequate in amount and scope for
Plastec's business and operations, including any insurance required to be

Actions/Filings (as defined in Section 2.21(c)) necessary to the conduct by
Plastec of any material portion of its business (as presently conducted and
as presently proposed to be conducted) or used or held for use by Plastec,
and true, complete and correct copies of which have heretofore been delivered
to GSME or GSME's counsel. Each such Governmental Action/Filing is in full
force and effect and no such Governmental Action/Filing must be renewed prior
to April 30, 2011, and Plastec is in compliance with all of its obligations
with respect thereto except where the failure to be in compliance would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect upon Plastec. No
event has occurred and is continuing which requires or permits, or after
notice or lapse of time or both would require or permit, and, except as may
result from the status of GSME as a holder of the shares of Merged Plastec,
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
ancillary documents will not require or permit (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both), any modification or termination of any such
Governmental Actions/Filing except such events which, either individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect upon Plastec.

 

 

(b) No Governmental Action/Filing is necessary to be obtained, secured or
made by Plastec that has not already been obtained, secured or made to enable
it to continue to conduct any material portion of its businesses and
operations and use any material portion of its properties after the Closing
through April 30, 2011 in a manner which is consistent with current practice.

 

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Governmental Action/Filing"
shall mean any franchise, license, certificate of compliance, authorization,
consent, order, permit, approval, consent or other action of, or any filing,
registration or qualification with, any federal, state, municipal, foreign or
other governmental, administrative or judicial body, agency or authority.

 

 

2.22 Interested Party Transactions. No employee, officer or director of
Plastec or immediate family member thereof is indebted to Plastec, nor is
Plastec indebted (or committed to make loans or extend or guarantee credit)
to any such Person, other than (i) for payment of salary and bonus for
services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of or
otherwise authorized by Plastec or in connection with such Person's duties as
an officer, director or employee of Plastec, and (iii) for other employee
benefits in the ordinary course of business. To Plastec's Knowledge, none of
such individuals has any direct or indirect material ownership interest in
any Person which is an Affiliate of Plastec or with which Plastec has a
material contractual relationship, or in any Person that competes with
Plastec, except that each employee, shareholder, officer or director of
Plastec and members of their respective immediate families may own less than
five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock in publicly traded companies that
may compete with Plastec. To the Knowledge of Plastec, no Plastec
Shareholder, officer, director or other Affiliate of the Plastec Shareholders
is, directly or indirectly, interested in any Material Plastec Contract with
Plastec (other than such contracts as relate to any such Person's ownership
of capital stock or other securities of Plastec or such Person's employment
with Plastec).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22

Agreement, duly approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Knowledge of Plastec, any officer, director, employee, agent or Affiliate of
Plastec has (a) used any funds of Plastec for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity; (b)
made any payment in violation of applicable law to any foreign or domestic
government official or employee or to any foreign or domestic political party
or campaign or violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended; or (c) made any other payment in violation of applicable
law.

operations in the United States, its territories or possessions and has no
assets (including bank accounts) located therein.

 

 

2.27 Representations and Warranties Complete. To Plastec's Knowledge,
the representations and warranties of Plastec included in this Agreement and
any list, statement, document or information set forth in, or attached to,
any Schedule provided pursuant to this Agreement or delivered hereunder, are

warranties of Plastec set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
until the end of the Escrow Period or such later date as may be set forth in

standing under the law of the Cayman Islands and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and

or operate and to carry on its business as it is now being or currently
planned by it to be conducted, except where the failure to have such
Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on GSME or GSME Sub. Complete and correct
copies of the Charter Documents of each of them, as amended and currently in
effect, have been heretofore delivered to Plastec. Neither is in violation of
any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

(b) Each is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on GSME or GSME Sub. At or prior to the Closing, GSME
will be duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation
and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement makes such qualification
or licensing necessary.

 

 

4.2 Subsidiaries. Other than GSME's ownership of GSME Sub, neither GSME nor
GSME Sub owns, directly or indirectly, any ownership, equity, profits or
voting interest in any other Person nor has any agreement or commitment to

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.3: (i) no GSME Shares or GSME

documents and agreements relating thereto.

 

 

(d) The GSME Shares to be issued by GSME pursuant to this Agreement, upon
issuance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly

is a party or by which GSME or GSME Sub is bound with respect to any equity
security of any class of GSME or GSME Sub.

perform this Agreement, and each ancillary document executed or delivered, or
to be executed or delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) carry out

contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of GSME (including the approval by its Board of
Directors) and all necessary company action on the part of GSME Sub
(including the approval by its Board of Directors), and no other corporate or
company proceedings on the part of GSME or GSME Sub are necessary to

hereby, other than the GSME Shareholder Approval (as defined in Section

GSME and GSME Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
thereof by the other Parties, constitutes the legal and binding obligation of

superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date
of such filing and as so amended or superseded) contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to

the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was or will be

involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, do not contain footnotes as permitted by the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Exchange Act) and each fairly
presents or will fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of GSME at the respective dates thereof and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were, are or will be subject to normal
adjustments which were not or are not expected to have a Material Adverse

6.1 Proxy Statement; Special Meeting.

 

 

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Plastec shall
deliver to GSME audited consolidated financial statements (including any
related notes thereto) of Plastec for the Fiscal Year ended April 30, 2010
(the "2010 Audited Financial Statements"). As soon as is reasonably
practicable after receipt by GSME from Plastec of all financial (including
the 2010 Audited Financial Statements) and other information relating to
Plastec as GSME may reasonably request for its preparation, GSME shall
prepare proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of
GSME Shares to vote, at a meeting of holders of GSME Shares to be called and
held for such purpose (the "Special Meeting"), in favor of (i) the approval
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "GSME
Shareholder Approval"), (ii) the change of the name of GSME to a
name mutually agreed upon by GSME and Plastec, (iii) an increase in the
number of authorized ordinary GSME Shares to one hundred million
(100,000,000) and (iv) an adjournment of the Special Meeting if, at the time
it is called to order, there are insufficient votes to obtain GSME
Shareholder Approval or the holders of eighty-one percent (81%) or more in
interest of the GSME Shares issued in GSME's IPO and outstanding immediately
before the Closing shall have exercised their rights to convert their shares
into a pro rata share of the Trust Fund in accordance with GSME's Charter
Documents. Such proxy materials shall be in the form of a proxy statement to
be used for the purpose of soliciting such proxies from holders of GSME
Shares for the matters to be acted upon at the Special Meeting (the
"Proxy Statement"). Plastec shall furnish to GSME all information concerning
Plastec as GSME may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of
the Proxy Statement. Plastec and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such proxy materials prior to their
distribution to GSME's shareholders and GSME will not distribute any
documents containing information that Plastec has reasonably determined
is incorrect or misleading and notified GSME in writing thereof.

 

 

(b) As soon as practicable following the preparation of the definitive Proxy
Statement, GSME shall distribute the Proxy Statement to the holders of GSME
Shares and, pursuant thereto, shall call the Special Meeting in accordance
with the Companies Law (Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the "Companies Law")
and GSME's Charter Documents and, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, solicit proxies from such holders to vote in favor of the approval
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other matters presented for approval or adoption at the Special Meeting.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) GSME shall use its best efforts to ensure that the Proxy Statement (i)
includes the information GSME believes would have been required to be
provided to shareholders had GSME not been a "foreign private issuer" (as
defined in the Exchange Act) but still had a class of equity securities
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and (ii) complies with all
applicable provisions of the Companies Law and GSME's Charter Documents in
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the
solicitation of proxies thereunder, and the calling and holding of the
Special Meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, GSME shall ensure that the
Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which the Proxy Statement is
first distributed to the shareholders of GSME, and as of the date of the
Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
(provided that GSME shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness
of any information relating to Plastec or any other information furnished by
Plastec for inclusion in the Proxy Statement). Plastec represents and
warrants that so long as GSME is in compliance with the terms of this Section
6.1, the information relating to Plastec supplied by Plastec for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement will not, as of the date on which the Proxy Statement is
first distributed to the shareholders of GSME or at the time of the Special
Meeting, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of
the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statement therein not false
or misleading.

 

 

(d) GSME, acting through its Board of Directors, shall include in the Proxy
Statement the unanimous recommendation of its Board of Directors that the
holders of GSME Shares vote in favor of the approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall otherwise use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the GSME Shareholder Approval.

 

 

(e) Plastec and each of the Plastec Shareholders shall cooperate with GSME
and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all information reasonably
requested by GSME in connection with any application or other filing made to
secure listing for trading or quotation of GSME's securities on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the NYSE Amex LLC or another national securities exchange
following the Effective Time.

 

 

6.2 Public Disclosure. From the date of this Agreement until (a) the later
of (x) the Closing or (y) the Effective Time or (b) the termination of this
Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to jointly prepare
all press releases and public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and
the transactions governed by it, and no Party shall issue or otherwise make
any public announcement or communication pertaining to this Agreement or the
Merger without the prior consent of GSME (in the case of Plastec and the
Plastec Shareholders) or Plastec (in the case of GSME or GSME Sub), except as
required by any legal requirement or by the rules and regulations of, or
pursuant to any agreement of, a stock exchange or trading system. Each Party
will not unreasonably delay, withhold or condition approval from the others
with respect to any press release or public announcement. If any Party
determines with the advice of counsel that it is required to make this
Agreement and the terms of the transaction public or otherwise issue a press
release or make public disclosure with respect thereto, it shall, at a
reasonable time before making any public disclosure, consult with the other
Parties regarding such disclosure, seek such confidential treatment for such
terms or portions of this Agreement or the transaction as may be reasonably
requested by the other Parties and disclose only such information as is
legally compelled to be disclosed. This provision will not apply to
communications by any Party to its counsel, accountants and other
professional advisors.

reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of GSME, GSME Sub and Plastec represents
and warrants to each other that all such information shall be true and
correct in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

Plastec during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all information
concerning the business, including the status of product development efforts,
properties, results of operations and personnel of Plastec, as GSME may

pursuant to this Section 6.5 will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

6.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,

shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such stock, assets or

shareholders upon GSME's liquidation if GSME fails to consummate a business

kind against GSME to collect from the Trust Fund or the L/C any monies that
may be owed to it by GSME for any reason whatsoever, including but not

concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and annexed hereto with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or

the period indicated, except that such statements need not contain notes and
may be subject to normal adjustments that are not expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Plastec.


 

6.12 Access to Financial Information. Plastec will, and will cause its

of Plastec's financial information used in the preparation of its Financial

6.23 Tax Treatment. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger

the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and this Agreement is
intended to be a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the
purpose of qualifying the Merger as a Tax-free transaction for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes. Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and will not take any action
inconsistent with the Merger qualifying as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code. Each of GSME and Plastec covenants and agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to defend in good faith all challenges to the
treatment of the Merger as a reorganization as described in this Section
6.23, and none of the Parties will take or cause to be taken any action which
would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying
as a reorganization under Section 368(a). Each of GSME and Plastec agree that
if such Party becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization described in
Section 368(a) of the Code, it will promptly notify the other Parties in
writing of such fact or circumstance. If applicable, each of GSME and Plastec
will comply with all reporting and record-keeping obligations set forth in
the Code and the U.S. Department of Treasury regulations that are consistent
with the Merger qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that no Party is making any representation or warranty as to the
qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code
or as to the effect, if any, that any transaction consummated prior to the
Closing Date has or may have on any such reorganization status. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that each: (i) has had the opportunity to obtain
independent legal and Tax advice with respect to the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for paying its own Taxes,
including without limitation, any adverse Tax consequences that may result if
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not determined to qualify
as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.

 

 

6.24 Continuing Business. For a period of one (1) year from the
Effective Time, GSME will continue at least one (1) significant historic
business line of Plastec, or use at least a significant portion of Plastec's
historic business assets in a business, each within the meaning of U.S.
Department of Treasury Regulation 1.368-1(d).

prior to such date. The 2010 Audited Financial Statements shall be audited by
Grant Thornton and shall comply with IFRS.

 

 

6.27 Termination of Shareholders Agreements. Plastec and the Plastec
Shareholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
termination, effective as of the Effective Time, of (a) the Subscription and
Shareholders' Agreement, dated as of October 28, 2005, relating to Plastec
among Plastec and certain of the Plastec Shareholders (the "2005

involving Plastec under which any of the Plastec Shareholders or any other
person has the right to vote, purchase or subscribe for shares of Plastec or
any of the Subsidiaries ("Other Shareholder Agreements" and together with

whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any insurance
and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under such
insurance, and the Indemnifying Representative shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of Third Party Claim at its expense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Defense. The Indemnifying Representative shall have the right, at its
option (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(c)) and at its
own expense, by written notice to the Indemnified Representative, to assume
the entire control of, subject to the right of the Indemnified Representative
to participate (at its expense and with counsel of its choice) in, the
defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as to which such
Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint a recognized
and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Representative
to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying
Representative is permitted and elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim:

 

 

(i) the Indemnifying Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend
such Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Representative
reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Representative shall have the right to approve any
settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and

 

 

(ii) the Indemnified Representative shall cooperate fully in all respects
with the Indemnifying Representative in any such defense, compromise or
settlement thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel,
and the Indemnified Representative shall make available to the
Indemnifying Representative all pertinent information and documents under
its control.

 

 

(c) Limitations of Right to Assume Defense. The Indemnifying Representative
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the applicable Indemnitee(s);
or (iii) there is a reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may
materially and adversely affect the applicable Indemnitee(s) other than as a
result of money damages or other money payments.

 

 

(d) Other Limitations. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to provide
copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant available data
shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any Third Party Claim
by any Indemnitee against the Indemnifying Representative and shall
not affect the Indemnifying Representative's duty or obligations under this
Article VIII, except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure
shall have adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying Representative
to defend against or reduce its liability or caused or increased such
liability or otherwise caused the damages to the applicable Indemnitee(s) to
be greater than such damages would have been had the applicable Indemnitee(s)
given the Indemnifying Representative prompt notice hereunder. So long as the
Indemnifying Representative is defending any such action actively and in good
faith, the Indemnified Representative shall not settle such action without
the consent of the Indemnifying Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Representative shall make
available to the Indemnifying Representative all relevant records and other
relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under the
control of the Indemnified Representative, for the use of the Indemnifying
Representative and its representatives in defending any such action, and
shall in other respects give reasonable cooperation in such defense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Failure to Defend. If the Indemnifying Representative, promptly
after receiving a Notice of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party Claim
actively and in good faith, the Indemnified Representative will (upon further
written notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim as it may determine in its reasonable
discretion, provided that the Indemnifying Representative shall have the
right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably
delayed, withheld or conditioned.

 

 

(f) Indemnitee Rights. Anything in this Section 8.2 to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Representative shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Representative, settle or compromise
any action or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to
each of the applicable Indemnitee(s) a full and unconditional release from
all liability and obligation in respect of such action without any payment by
any Indemnitee.

 

 

(g) Representative Consent. Unless the Indemnifying Representative has
consented to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the
settlement shall not be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and
such amount shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

 

 

8.3 Insurance Effect. To the extent that any Losses that are subject
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII are covered by insurance,
the applicable Indemnitee(s) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance; provided that the
applicable Indemnitee(s) shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim
for indemnification under this Article VIII in respect of such Losses and the
time limitations set forth in Section 8.4 hereof for bringing a claim
of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency
of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by an Indemnitee for monies
from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss shall not,
however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions
contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by the
Indemnifying Representative. If an Indemnitee has received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Representative in respect of
any Loss and later receives proceeds from insurance or other amounts in
respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in
trust for the benefit of the Indemnifying Representative and shall pay to the
Indemnifying Representative, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum
equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to
the aggregate amount of any payments received from the Indemnifying
Representative pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Loss.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention
of the Parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled
to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility
to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Survival; Time Limitation. The representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any writing delivered by Plastec or
the Plastec Shareholders to GSME, or by GSME to the Plastec Shareholders,
in connection with this Agreement (including the GSME Closing Certificate,
the Plastec Closing Certificate and the Plastec Shareholder Closing
Certificates) and the obligation of GSME, the Insiders and the Investors to
indemnify the applicable Indemnitee(s) pursuant to Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b)
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the Escrow Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the representations, warranties and
covenants of Plastec in each of Section 2.1(a) (Organization), Section 2.2(b)
(Subsidiaries), Section 2.3 (Capitalization) and Section 2.4 (Authority
Relative to this Agreement) and of the Plastec Shareholders in Article III
shall survive without limitation as to time, (ii) the representations,
warranties and covenants of Plastec in each of Sections 2.14 (Title to
Property) and 2.15 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until the sixtieth
(60th) day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
(iii) the representations, warranties and covenants of GSME in each of
Section 4.1(a) (Organization), Section 4.2 (Subsidiaries), Section 4.3
(Capitalization) and Section 4.4 (Authority Relative to this Agreement) shall
survive without limitation as to time and (iv) the representations,
warranties and covenants of GSME in each of Sections 4.14 (Title to Property)
and 4.15 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until the sixtieth day following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations

 

 

(b) No claim for indemnification under this Article VIII shall be brought
after the end of the relevant period specified in Section 8.4(a). Any claim
made by an Indemnitee that is required to be made and is made prior to the
expiration of the Escrow Period or other relevant period specified in Section
8.4(a) shall be preserved despite the subsequent expiration of the Escrow
Period or such other relevant period and any such claim set forth in a Notice
of Claim sent prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period or such other
relevant period shall survive until final resolution thereof.

 

 

(c) Deductible. No amount shall be payable under Article VIII unless and
until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable
exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (the "Deductible")
but thereafter shall be required to indemnify the applicable Indemnitee(s) to
the full extent of their Losses from the first dollar thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses resulting with respect to the
representations, warranties and covenants referred to in the last sentence of
Section 8.4(a) ("Surviving Matters") and payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) shall not be included in the
calculation of the Deductible and an Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification with respect to such Losses and payments as though there were
no Deductible.


 

(d) Exclusive Remedy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and
after the Closing, the sole remedy of the Indemnities with respect to any and
all claims for damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be pursuant and subject to the requirements of the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article VIII. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Article VIII shall in any way impair,
modify or otherwise limit an Indemnitee's right to bring any claim, demand or
suit against the other Parties based upon such other Parties' actual fraud.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.5 Adjustment to Purchase Consideration. Amounts paid for indemnification
under Article VIII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration paid to the Plastec Shareholders, except as otherwise required
by a Legal Requirement.

 

 

8.6 Representative Capacities. The Parties acknowledge that the
Representative's obligations under this Article VIII are solely as a
representative of the Insiders and the Investors in the manner set forth in
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify
GSME under this Article VIII and that the Representative shall have no
responsibility for any expenses incurred by it in such capacity and that all
payments to GSME as a result of such indemnification obligations shall be
made solely from, and to the extent of, the Indemnity Escrow Shares. Out-of-
pocket expenses of the Representative for attorneys' fees and other costs
shall be borne in the first instance by GSME, which may make a claim for
reimbursement thereof against the Indemnity Escrow Shares upon the claim with
respect to which such expenses are incurred becoming an Established Claim (as
defined in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement). The Parties further acknowledge
that all actions to be taken by GSME pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
taken on its behalf by the GSME Committee in accordance with the provisions
of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement after the Closing, may apply all or a portion of
the Indemnity Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Article VIII. The Escrow Agent will hold the remaining portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Shares until final resolution of all claims for
indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

 

 

8.7 Indemnification of Plastec Shareholder Indemnitee. In the event that a
Plastec Shareholder Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified by GSME pursuant
to this Article VIII for Losses incurred by such Plastec Shareholder
Indemnitee, GSME shall issue to such Plastec Shareholder Indemnitee GSME
Shares with a Fair Market Value (as defined in the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement) equal to the amount of such Losses. In the event that Losses
suffered by a Plastec Shareholder Indemnitee and paid to the shareholders of
GSME are as a result of Losses suffered by GSME (by virtue of their ownership
interest in GSME), then each Plastec Shareholder Indemnitee shall be entitled
to recover a percentage of such Losses equal to such Plastec Shareholder
Indemnitee's percentage ownership of all issued and outstanding GSME Shares.

 

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 

TERMINATION

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) by either GSME or Plastec if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated by May 25, 2011 (the "Termination
Date") for any reason; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose
action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
failure of such consummation to occur on or before such date and such action
or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

 

(c) by either GSME or Plastec if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, decree, judgment or ruling or taken any other action, in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which order,

(d) by Plastec, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of GSME or GSME
Sub, or if any representation or warranty of GSME or GSME Sub shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Article
VII would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue; provided, that
if such breach by GSME or GSME Sub is curable by GSME or GSME Sub prior to
the Closing Date, then Plastec may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(d) for thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice from
Plastec to GSME or GSME Sub of such breach, provided GSME or GSME Sub
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it

that the conditions set forth in Article VII would not be satisfied as of the
time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall
have become untrue; provided, that if such breach is curable by Plastec or

terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) for thirty (30) days after

of such breach, provided Plastec or such Plastec Shareholder continue to
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being
understood that GSME may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
breach by Plastec or the Plastec Shareholders is cured during such thirty
(30)-day period);

adjournments thereof), this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby shall fail to be approved and adopted by the affirmative vote of the
holders of GSME Shares required under GSME's Charter Documents, or the
holders of eighty one percent (81%) or more in interest of the holders of
GSME Shares issued in GSME's IPO and outstanding as of the date of the record

held by them into cash in accordance with GSME's Charter Documents; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61

therein is applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery of written notice
of the terminating Party to the other Parties hereto. In the event of

to occur on or before the date stated therein.

permitted by law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the
other documents relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to which it is party.

 

 

11.4 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same document and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile or email
attachment to counsel for the other Parties of a counterpart executed by a

documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the letter of intent between

11.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

11.7 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States, any state of the United

this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, and each Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts.

in accordance with the law of the State of New York regardless of the law
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

 

 

11.9 Rules of Construction. Plastec, GSME, GSME Sub and Cathay agree
that they each have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

 

11.10 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties, except that GSME may assign its rights
hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary formed for such purpose; provided that
no such assignment by GSME shall relieve GSME of its obligations and
liabilities hereunder. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 11.10,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

 

11.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

 

 

11.12 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, any Party may,
to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any

11.13 Arbitration. Except as set forth in Section 11.7, the Parties hereto
agree that any action, proceeding or claim arising out of or relating in any
way to this Agreement shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration
in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Notice of a demand to arbitrate a dispute by
any Party shall be given in writing to the others at their last known
addresses. The arbitration shall be brought before the AAA International
Center for Dispute Resolution's offices in New York City, New York, will be
conducted in English and will be decided by a panel of three arbitrators
selected from the AAA Commercial Disputes Panel. The arbitrator panel's
decision shall be final and enforceable by any court having jurisdiction over
the Parties against whom enforcement is sought. The cost of such arbitrators
and arbitration services, together with the prevailing Party's legal fees and
expenses, shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party or as otherwise directed
by the arbitrators. The arbitrator shall supply a written opinion
supporting any award, and judgment may be entered on the award in any court
of competent jurisdiction. In the event that preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief is necessary or desirable in order to prevent a Party from
acting contrary to this Agreement or to prevent irreparable harm prior to
a confirmation of an arbitration award, then any Party is authorized and
entitled to commence a lawsuit solely to obtain equitable relief against any
other pending the completion of the arbitration in a court having
jurisdiction over the Parties. Each Party hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of New
York, New York County, for such purpose. All rights and remedies of the
Parties shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies
obtainable from arbitration.

 

 

11.14 Currency. All monetary amounts set forth herein are referenced in
United States dollars, unless otherwise noted.
