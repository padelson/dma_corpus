(d) any cash and cash equivalents, money market funds and marketable

"Kelley Book Value" of each of the vehicles listed on _Exhibit 1.4_, and at
the Closing, the Trust shall cause Sellers to pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the aggregate values of such vehicles.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Assumed Liabilities_. Upon the terms set forth in this Agreement,
on the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, perform and
discharge, as and when due, the following, and only the following, Liabilities
of each Seller (the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "):

 



 

(a) those Liabilities of such Seller reflected or reserved against on the face
of the Final Closing Statement, but only in the amounts so reflected or
reserved (and, in the case of Liabilities to service, repair, replace or re-
perform Products/Services, subject to _subclause (b)_ below);

 



      
 

 



 

(b) those Liabilities of such Seller to service, repair, replace or re-perform
Products/Services sold by such Seller prior to the Closing Date of the type
currently sold by such Seller, but only to the extent required and limited by
the written warranties for such Products/Services set forth in _Section 3.21_
of the Disclosure Schedule given by such Seller in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and to the extent of the amount of the
warranty accrual reflected on the face of the Final Closing Statement (the "
_Assumed Warranty Liabilities_ ");

 



 

(c) those Liabilities of such Seller arising from and after the Closing Date
under and pursuant to the Assumed Benefit Plans, except to the extent
otherwise set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_; and

 



 

(d) those Liabilities of such Seller arising from and after the Closing Date
under and pursuant to the Assumed Contracts (and, in the case of Liabilities
to service, repair, replace or re-perform Products/Services, subject to
_subclause (b)_ above).

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall assume Liabilities of any Seller with
respect to any goods delivered, or any services provided, to such Seller prior
to the Closing Date for which an invoice is delivered on or after the Closing
Date, but, in each case, only to the extent such Liabilities are reflected or
reserved against on the face of the Final Closing Statement. Buyers
assumption of and agreement to pay, perform and discharge, as and when due,
the Assumed Liabilities shall not prohibit Buyer from contesting with any
third party the amount, validity or enforceability of any of the Assumed
Liabilities, provided that Buyers doing so shall not change the
characterization of such Liabilities as Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Excluded Liabilities_. Except as and to the extent specifically
set forth in _Section 1.5_, Buyer is not assuming any Liabilities of any
Seller (or the Trust). Without limitation, and notwithstanding the provisions
of _Section 1.5_, Buyer is not assuming, and no Seller shall be deemed to
have assigned or otherwise transferred to Buyer, any of the Excluded
Liabilities. The Trust shall cause the Utility Sellers to, and DTUENY shall,
pay, perform and discharge, as and when due, all of the Excluded Liabilities.
Such agreement shall not prohibit any Seller from contesting with any third
party the amount, validity or enforceability of any of the Excluded
Liabilities, provided that such Sellers doing so shall not change the
characterization of such Liabilities as Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Nonassignable Contracts and Other Assets_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no assets of any Seller, including
Contracts, that otherwise would constitute Purchased Assets shall be deemed
sold, transferred or assigned to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement if the
attempted sale, transfer or assignment thereof to Buyer without the consent or
approval of any other Person would be ineffective, would constitute a breach
of contract or a violation of any Law or Order or would in any other way
adversely affect the rights of such Seller (or Buyer as transferee or
assignee) and such consent or approval is not obtained at or prior to the
Closing. In such case, to the extent possible: (a) the beneficial interest in
or to such assets (collectively, the " _Beneficial Rights_ ") shall in any
event pass at the Closing to Buyer under this Agreement; and (b) pending such
consent or approval, Buyer shall discharge the obligations of such Seller
under such Beneficial Rights (to the extent such obligations constitute
Assumed Liabilities) as agent for such Seller, and the Trust shall cause such
Seller to,

 



      
 

 



 

or DTUENY shall, as the case may be, act as Buyers agent in the receipt of
any benefits, rights or interest received from the Beneficial Rights. The
Trust and DTUENY shall use their reasonable best efforts (and bear their
respective costs of such efforts) to obtain and secure all consents and
approvals that may be necessary to effect the legal and valid sale, transfer
or assignment of the assets underlying the Beneficial Rights to Buyer without
any change in any of the material terms or conditions of such assets, and
Buyer shall provide such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the
Trust and DTUENY. The Trust and DTUENY shall make or complete such transfers
as soon as reasonably possible and cooperate with Buyer in any other
reasonable arrangement designed to provide for Buyer the benefits of such
assets, including enforcement at the cost and for the account of Buyer of any
and all rights of the applicable Seller against the other party thereto
arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party or
otherwise, and to provide for the discharge of any Liability under such assets
to the extent such Liability constitutes an Assumed Liability. If and to the
extent an arrangement acceptable to Buyer with respect to Beneficial Rights
cannot be made, then Buyer, upon written notice to Appointed Agent, shall have
no obligation under _Section 1.5_ or otherwise with respect to any such
asset, and such asset shall not be deemed to be a Purchased Asset and the
related Liability shall not be deemed an Assumed Liability.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase
Price_ ") for the Purchased Assets shall be (a) the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, (b) an amount equal to the Asset Value as reflected on the Final
Closing Statement and (c) the amounts that become payable in accordance with
_Section 2.4_, if any.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Payment_. The Purchase Price shall be paid as follows:

Buyer and Appointed Agent.

 



 

(b) _Payment of Indebtedness Payoff Amount_. At the Closing, Buyer shall

Closing Statement.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Indemnity Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver
to Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement an amount equal to $18,000,000 (the
" _Indemnity Escrow Deposit_ "). The Escrow Agreement will provide, among
other things, that, on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers
(through delivery to the Trust) will be entitled to receive 50% of the
Indemnity Escrow Deposit, less amounts that may be necessary to satisfy any
pending claims and, on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers
(through delivery to the Trust) will be entitled to the balance of the
Indemnity Escrow Deposit, less amounts that may be necessary to satisfy any
pending claims.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Payment of Closing Date Amount_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
the Trust (for the benefit and account of Sellers) an amount equal to the

_Acquisition Proceeds_ ").

 



 

(e) _Payment of Final Adjustment Amount_. On or before the fifth Business Day
following the determination of the Final Closing Statement (the " _Settlement

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Buyer shall

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Trust and
DTUENY shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of the Final
Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(f) _Payment of Earnout Amount_. At the time or times specified in _Section
2.4_, Buyer shall deliver to the Trust (for an on behalf of all Sellers) the
amounts that become payable under _Section 2.4_, if any.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Determination of Net Working Capital_.

 



 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As used in this Agreement, " _Closing Statement_ "
shall mean (collectively) as of a specified time (i) an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of Sellers showing the net book value of the categories of
assets and liabilities set forth in the Reference Closing Statement, but
reflecting only the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) a
statement reflecting the calculation of the Net Working Capital and (iii) a
statement reflecting the calculation of the Indebtedness Payoff Amount. The
Parties agree that each Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the preparation, and in the form, of the Reference Closing
Statement as to accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodologies. Without
limitation, for purposes of preparing the Preliminary Closing Statement, each
Seller shall complete a physical inventory as of the Effective Time, and Buyer
shall have the right to monitor and/or participate in such physical inventory.

 



 

(b) _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date:

 



 

(i) The Trust shall deliver to Buyer a schedule that sets forth the Trusts
reasonable, good faith estimate of the Closing Statement as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date, together with a calculation of the Asset Value
and the Acquisition Proceeds based thereon (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be based on Sellers
internal books and records as of the end of the last preceding month end for
which the required data is available. The Trust shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause Sellers to provide Buyer and its representatives with reasonable access
to all books and records reasonably necessary for Buyer to review the
calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement (including all books
and records that the Trust utilized in preparing the Estimated Closing
Statement and the chief financial officer of the Sellers) and discuss and
consider any adjustments to the Estimated Closing Statement that Buyer
proposes in good faith.

 



 

(ii) The Trust shall deliver to Buyer (A) a schedule that sets forth the
respective amounts, payees and wire transfer instructions with respect to each
item of the Indebtedness Payoff Amount included within the Estimated Closing
Statement and (B) the forms of payoff letters in customary form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Appointed Agent that will be executed at the Closing
by the lenders of such Indebtedness Payoff Amount, which payoff letters shall
include the lenders release, upon payment at the Closing, of all Liens of
such lenders affecting the Purchased Assets.

 



 

(c) _Preliminary Closing Statement_. Within 60 days after the Closing Date
(or, if later, within 60 days after the date that Sellers audited financial
statements are finalized), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Appointed Agent
a Closing Statement as of the opening of business on the Closing Date,
together with a calculation of the Asset Value and the Acquisition Proceeds
based thereon and the Proposed Adjustment Amount (the " _Preliminary Closing
Statement_ "). The Parties shall comply with the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.5_ with respect to the review and potential adjustment of the
Preliminary Closing Statement.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Earnout Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Preliminary Earnout Statement_. On or before April 15th of the calendar
year following the applicable Earnout Year, Buyer shall provide Appointed
Agent with an unaudited income statement of Buyer with respect to such Earnout
Year, together with a calculation of the Earnout Actual Gross Sales, Earnout
Actual Gross Profit and Earnout Payment Ratio for such Earnout Year (the "
_Preliminary Earnout Statement_ "). The Parties agree that such income
statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as applied by Buyer on a
consistent basis except (i) for the absence of footnote disclosure and (ii)
expenses historically treated by Sellers as operating expenses that, under
GAAP, are included in cost of sales (e.g., freight) shall be added to Earnout
Actual Gross Profit for purposes of calculating the Annual Earnout Payments to
which the Sellers are entitled, if any. The Parties shall comply with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.5_ with respect to the review and
potential adjustment of each Preliminary Earnout Statement.

 



 

(b) _Annual Earnout Payments_. On or before the fifth Business Day following
the determination of each Final Earnout Statement, Buyer shall pay to the
Trust (for the benefit and account of Sellers) an amount equal to the Earnout
Potential Payment _multiplied by_ the Earnout Payment Ratio reflected on such
Final Earnout Statement (the " _Annual Earnout Payment_ "). For the avoidance
of doubt, if the Earnout Payment Ratio reflected on such Final Earnout
Statement is zero, then Buyer shall have no obligations under this _Section
2.4(b)_ with respect to the applicable Earnout Year. For illustrative purposes
only, the attached _Exhibit 2.4(b)_ sets forth sample calculations for the
Earnout Annual Payment based on certain assumed facts specified thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Post-Closing Operation of the Business_. During the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on last day of the final Earnout Year, Buyer shall
(i) maintain the records of Buyer in a manner permitting accurate preparation
of financial statements consistent with _Section 2.4(a)_ and permitting the
good faith calculation of the Annual Earnout Payments, (ii) operate the
Business through Buyer and not in or through any Affiliate of Buyer (it being
understood that this provision shall not restrict the purchase and sale of
goods or services involving Affiliates in a manner generally consistent with
the conduct of business involving Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, prior to the Closing), (iii) supply goods to
Sellers (and provide rebates, credits and other allowances in connection with
such supply of goods) in a manner generally consistent with the conduct of the
business involving Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, prior to the Closing, and (iv) not take any action outside the
ordinary course of business with the intent to negatively impact the
achievement or payment of the Annual Earnout Payments.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Final Determination Process_.

 



 

(a) _Statement Objection_. Within 60 days after Buyer provides Appointed Agent
with the Preliminary Closing Statement or the Preliminary Earnout Statement
(as the case may be, the " _Subject Statement_ "), Appointed Agent shall
complete its review of the Subject Statement. Upon request, Buyer shall
provide Appointed Agent and its representatives with reasonable access to all
books and records reasonably necessary for Appointed Agent to review the
calculations set forth in the Subject Statement (including all books and
records that Buyer utilized in preparing the Subject Statement and a Buyer-
designated representative involved in preparing the Subject Statement).
Appointed Agent may object to the content of the Subject Statement, but only
on the basis that the amounts reflected in the Subject Statement were not
determined in accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ and _Section 2.3(c)_ in the
case of the Preliminary Closing Statement or _Section 2.4(a)_ and _Section
2.4(c)_ in the case of the Preliminary Earnout Statement or were determined
based on mathematical, clerical or similar error. Appointed Agent shall make
any such objection on or prior to the last day of such 60-day period by
providing Buyer with a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail a
description of the basis of the objection and the adjustments to the Subject
Statement that Appointed Agent believes should be made (a " _Statement
Objection_ ").

 



 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. If Appointed Agent timely provides Buyer with a
Statement Objection, then Buyer and Appointed Agent shall promptly attempt in
good faith to resolve any dispute or disagreement relating to the Subject
Statement (the " _Statement Dispute_ "). If Buyer and Appointed Agent are
unable to resolve the Statement Dispute within 30 days after delivery of the
Statement Objection, then, at any time thereafter, either Buyer or Appointed
Agent may elect to have the Statement Dispute resolved by Deloitte and Touche
LLP or another nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as
to which Buyer and Appointed Agent mutually agree (the " _CPA Firm_ "). The
CPA Firm shall, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, determine on

 



      
 

 



 

the basis of the standards expressly set forth in this Agreement, and only
with respect to the remaining accounting related differences so submitted to
the CPA Firm (and not by independent review), whether and to what extent, if
any, the amounts reflected in the Subject Statement require adjustment. In
connection with the engagement of the CPA Firm, Buyer and Appointed Agent
shall execute reasonable engagement letters and supply such other documents
and information as the CPA Firm reasonably requires or as such Party
reasonably deems appropriate. The CPA Firm shall be instructed to use every
reasonable effort to perform its services within 15 days after submission of
the Statement Dispute to it and, in any case, as soon as practicable after
such submission. In resolving the Statement Dispute, the CPA Firm (A) shall
utilize the criteria set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_ and _Section 2.3(c)_ or
_Section 2.4(a)_ and _Section 2.4(c)_ (as the case may be) and (B) shall not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by Buyer or Appointed Agent, or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by Buyer or Appointed Agent, as set forth in the Subject
Statement or the Statement Objection. Absent fraud or manifest error, the CPA
Firms determination of the Statement Dispute shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties. All fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in connection with the
services provided pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)_ shall be borne equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Trust and DTUENY, on the other hand.

 



 

(c) _Confidentiality_. Except to the extent required by applicable Law,
Appointed Agent shall not directly or indirectly disclose any content of the
Subject Statement to any Person (other than to its representatives and the CPA
Firm in connection with the resolution of a Statement Dispute pursuant to
_Section 2.5(b)_) without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Other Payments and Adjustments_. DTUENY shall, and the Trust
shall cause Utility Sellers to, pay directly to their respective employees the
amount of wages and other compensation (including bonuses) earned for all
periods prior to the Effective Time, and to the extent paid by Sellers, such
wages and other compensation shall not be accrued on the Final Closing

and Buyer shall thereby receive a credit on the Settlement Date in an amount
equal to the dollar amount of, all vacation, holiday and sick pay unpaid by
Sellers as of the Effective Time attributable to any period or partial period
of employment by Sellers prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent
that such vacation, holiday and sick pay is required to be paid by Sellers at

applicable thereto due or to become due, for the Active Transferred Employees
and (a) who as of the Effective Time have not taken all of their vacation,
holiday or sick time earned prior to Closing or (b) who have not earned
vacation, holiday or sick time as of the Effective Time but who would have
earned vacation, holiday or sick time for any such period or partial period of
employment prior to the Closing (on a pro rata basis) had they continued as
employees of a Seller to the date when such vacation, holiday or sick pay
would have accrued to them, and Buyer shall assume and honor all such
obligations of Sellers in respect of such vacation, holiday and sick time but
only to the extent of such accrual on the Final Closing Statement.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.7 _Method of Payment_. All cash payments under _Section 2.2_ shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account that the
recipient, at least 48 hours prior to the time for payment specified under
this Agreement, has designated.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Withholding_. To the extent applicable, Buyer shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amount payable under this Agreement any
withholding Taxes or other amounts required under applicable Law to be
deducted and withheld. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid (and shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE TRUST AND DTUENY**

 



 

As an inducement to Buyer to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Trust and
DTUENY make the following representations and warranties to Buyer, each of
which is true and correct on the date of this Agreement, shall remain true and
correct through and including the Closing Date with reference to the facts and
circumstances then existing (it being understood that, for representations and
warranties that speak as of a specific date or time, such representations and
warranties will be true and correct only as of such date or time) and shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Due Organization and Power_.

 



 

(a) _The Trust_. The Trust is duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of the State of Florida. The Trust has all requisite trust power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered by the Trust pursuant hereto and to
carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Trust directly
or indirectly owns all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of
Utility Sellers, free and clear of all Liens. Except as set forth in _Section
3.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Trust owns no assets other than life
insurance policies on the life of the settlor of the Trust and the direct or
indirect ownership of the Equity Interests of Utility Sellers and is not
subject to any liabilities.

 



 

(b) _Sellers_. Each Seller is a corporation or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each Seller has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority to own, operate and lease its
assets, to carry on its business as and where such is currently conducted, to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the other documents and instruments to
be executed and delivered by such Seller pursuant hereto and to carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each Seller is duly licensed or
qualified to do business as a foreign entity, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the assets owned or leased by it, or
the nature of its business, makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
with such exceptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
resulted, and are not reasonably likely to result, in a Material Adverse
Effect. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and
complete list of the jurisdictions in which each Seller is duly licensed or
qualified to do business as a foreign entity. No Seller owns, directly or
indirectly, any

 



      
 

 



 

Equity Interests of any Person (whether or not such Person is disregarded for
Tax purposes). Each Seller has delivered to Buyer correct and complete copies
of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable charter
documents, including all amendments thereto. Since January 1, 2006, no Seller
has engaged in any business other than the Business.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Authority_. The execution and delivery by the Trust and DTUENY of
this Agreement and the other documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered by the Trust and Sellers pursuant hereto and the consummation by the
Trust and Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly authorized by the Trust and Sellers. No other or further act or
proceeding (corporate, limited liability company or otherwise) on the part of
the Trust or any Seller (including their respective beneficiaries or
equityholders) is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the other documents
and instruments to be executed and delivered by the Trust and Sellers pursuant
hereto or the consummation by the Trust and Sellers of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement constitutes, and when executed
and delivered, the other documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered by the Trust and Sellers pursuant hereto will constitute, valid and
binding agreements of the Trust and Sellers (as applicable), enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as limited by (a) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally, and (b) laws relating to the availability of
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

 



 

Section 3.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery by the Trust
and DTUENY of this Agreement or the other documents and instruments to be
executed and delivered by the Trust and Sellers pursuant hereto nor the
consummation by the Trust and Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby will (a) violate any statute, law (including common law),
ordinance, rule or regulation (collectively, " _Laws_ ") or any order, writ,
injunction, judgment, plan or decree (collectively, " _Orders_ ") of any
government, court, arbitrator, department, commission, board, bureau, agency,
authority, instrumentality or other body, whether federal, state, municipal,
county, local, foreign, supranational or other (collectively, " _Governmental
Entities_ ") applicable to the Trust or any Seller, (b) subject to obtaining
the consents set forth in _Section 3.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, require
any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other action by or notice
to any Governmental Entity, (c) subject to obtaining the consents set forth in
_Section 3.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, violate or conflict with,
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default) under, result in the termination or give rise to a
right of termination or modification of, or accelerate the performance
required by, any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other comparable formation or charter documents of the Trust or any Seller or
of any material Contract to which the Trust or any Seller is party or by which
the Trust, any Seller or any Purchased Assets may be bound or affected or (d)
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Purchased Assets (other
than Liens created by Buyer or any of its Affiliates).

 



 

Section 3.4 _Financial Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Financial Statements_. _Section 3.4(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
contains correct and complete copies of (i) the unaudited combined financial
statements

 



      
 

 



 

(including balance sheets and statements of operations, retained earnings and
members capital, and cash flows) of Sellers and certain Affiliates for each
of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 (including
the notes contained therein or annexed thereto), which financial statements
have been reviewed by Margolin, Winer and Evans LLP, independent accountants for
Sellers for such years, (ii) an unaudited, combined balance sheet of Sellers
as of December 31, 2015 and the related income statement for the fiscal year
then ended and (iii) an unaudited combined balance sheet of Sellers as of
April 30, 2016 (the " _Recent Balance Sheet_ ") and the related income
statement for the four months then ended. All such financial statements (A)
are prepared from and consistent with such financial statements as have been
prepared and used by Sellers in the ordinary course of managing their
respective business and measuring and reporting its operating results, (B) are
prepared in accordance with the accounting methods, policies, practices and
procedures historically employed by Sellers in the ordinary course of
business, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodologies, and with the books and records of Sellers and (C) fairly
present in all material respects the assets, Liabilities, financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of Sellers as of the dates and for the
periods indicated.

 



 

(b) _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as and to the extent specifically set
forth on the face of the Recent Balance Sheet or in _Section 3.4(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, Sellers have no Liabilities that GAAP would require to be
reflected or reserved against on the face of a balance sheet other than
commercial Liabilities incurred since the date of the Recent Balance Sheet in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that,
individually and in the aggregate, have not resulted, and are not reasonably
likely to result, in a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Provision for Taxes_. The unpaid Taxes of the Sellers (i) did not, as of
the Recent Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (excluding any
provision for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Recent Balance Sheet (rather
than in any notes thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past
custom and practice of the Sellers in filing their Tax Returns. Since the date
of the Recent Balance Sheet, no Seller has incurred any Taxes other than Taxes
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent in type and amount with
past practice.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_. All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on
behalf of Sellers have been timely filed and, when filed, were correct and
complete in all material respects. All Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns have been, or will be, timely paid by Sellers. Sellers have duly
withheld, collected and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity all
Taxes that they are required to withhold, collect and pay in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any Person, including any equityholder, director,
employee, independent contractor or third party.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Tax Audits_. No claim has been made in writing by any Governmental Entity
in a jurisdiction where a Seller does not file Tax Returns that such Seller is
or may be subject to taxation in such jurisdiction. Any deficiencies proposed
as a result of any audits of any Seller by any Governmental Entity have been
paid or settled, and there are no present disputes as to Taxes payable by
Seller in connection with the Business or the Purchased Assets. Except as set
forth in _Section 3.5(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no
unexpired waivers or extensions of any statute of limitations with respect to
any Taxes of Seller and Seller is not a party to any action or proceedings by
any Governmental Entity for the collection or assessment of Taxes against it
in connection with the Business or the Purchased Assets. There are no Liens,
other than Permitted Liens, on any of the Purchased Assets that arose in
connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax.

 



 

(d) _Tax Status_. Each Seller that is a corporation properly and timely filed
a valid election under Section 1362 of the Code to be treated as an S
corporation as defined under Section 1361 of the Code for federal income tax
purposes and a corresponding valid election under the Laws of their respective
jurisdiction of organization, in each case, effective prior to the later of
January 1, 2006 or the date such Sellers incorporation. Such elections have
remained in effect since such dates. No Person has taken any action or failed
to take any action, nor has any event occurred, that would result in the
revocation or termination of any of such elections at any time.

 



 

(e) _Tax Rulings_. No Seller has requested or received any Tax ruling, private
letter ruling, technical advice memorandum, competent authority relief or
similar agreement from the IRS (or other authority responsible for the
administration or collection of Taxes). No Seller has received any Tax opinion
with respect to any transaction relating to such Seller other than
transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 



 

(f) _Tax Exemptions_. Each Seller is in compliance with the terms and
conditions of all applicable transferable Tax exemptions, Tax agreements and
Tax orders of any Governmental Entity to which it may be subject or to which
it may have claimed, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not have any adverse effect on such compliance.

 



 

(g) _Closing Agreements_. Except for a resolution of the New York State Sales
and Use Tax Exam described in _Section 3.5(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Seller entered into a closing agreement or other similar agreement with a
Governmental Entity relating to Taxes of such Seller with respect to a taxable
period for which the statute of limitations is still open.

 



 

(h) _Reportable Transactions_. No Seller has been a party to any "reportable
transaction" as defined under Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code or Section
1.6011-4(b) of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(i) _Section 280G Matters_. No Seller is party to any Contract that has
resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of
(i) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law) or (ii) any obligation to withhold Taxes pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.6 _Transferred Receivables_. All Transferred Receivables (a) arose
out of arms length transactions made in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (b) are the valid and legally binding
obligations of the Persons obligated to pay such amounts, (c) are collectible
(net of the reserves for doubtful accounts shown on the Final Closing
Statement) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
without the necessity of commencing Litigation, (d) are subject to no
counterclaim or setoff and (e) are not in dispute.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Inventory_. All Inventory reflected on the Recent Balance Sheet
(a) has been valued in a manner consistent with past practice, (b) is valued
at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market and (c)
consists of a quality and quantity usable and saleable in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice. All Inventory purchased since the
date of the Recent Balance Sheet consists of a quality and quantity usable and
saleable in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.
All Inventory is located at, or is in transit to or from, the Real Property,
other than an aggregate of approximately $40,000 of Inventory on consignment
in Maryland, New York and Rhode Island. All work-in-process consists of a
quality ordinarily produced in accordance with the requirements of the
Contracts to which such work-in-process relates and will require no material
rework with respect to services performed prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the date of the Recent Balance
Sheet until the date of this Agreement, (a) each Seller has conducted its
business only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (b)
there has not been: (i) any change, event, development, condition, occurrence
or combination of changes, events, developments, conditions or occurrences
that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or is reasonably
expected by the Trust or DTUENY to result, in a Material Adverse Effect; (ii)
any material loss, damage or destruction, whether or not covered by insurance,
relating to or affecting the business, assets or Liabilities of any Seller or
Real Property; or (iii) except as set forth in _Section 3.8_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, any action taken by any Seller that would have required
the consent of Buyer under _Section 5.1_ (other than _Section 5.1(b)(ix)_)
if such action was taken after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.9 _No Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no Litigation pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened or anticipated against any Seller or its equityholders, directors,
managers or officers (in such capacity) or its business, assets or
Liabilities. To Sellers Knowledge, no event has occurred or action taken that
is reasonably likely to result in any such Litigation. Neither any Seller nor
any portion of its business or assets is subject to any Order (excluding
Orders of general application).

 



 

Section 3.10 _Laws and Orders_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except for past violations for which Sellers are not subject to
any current Liability and cannot become subject to any future Liability,
Sellers (including their respective businesses and assets) are and have been
in compliance with all applicable Laws and Orders except for instances of
noncompliance where neither the

 



      
 

 



 

costs and penalties associated with noncompliance nor the costs associated
with rectifying the noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, are
material. Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, since January 1, 2013, no Seller has received notice of any
violation or alleged violation of any Laws or Orders in any material respect.
All material reports, filings and other instruments required to be filed by or
on behalf of any Seller with any Governmental Entity have been filed and, when
filed, were correct and complete in all material respects.

 



 

(b) _Permits_. Sellers have all material Permits required for the conduct of
the Business and the occupancy of the Real Property. All such Permits are set
forth in _Section 3.10(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, are in full force and
effect and, except as set forth in _Section 3.10(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, will not be affected or made subject to any loss, limitation or
obligation to reapply as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except for past violations for which Sellers
are not subject to any current Liability and cannot become subject to any
future Liability, Sellers (including their respective businesses and assets)
are and have been in compliance with all such Permits except for instances of
noncompliance where neither the costs and penalties associated with
noncompliance nor the costs associated with rectifying the noncompliance,
individually or in the aggregate, are material.

set forth in _Section 3.10(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no past
or present (or, to Sellers Knowledge, future) events, conditions,
circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, actions, omissions or plans
that are reasonably expected to (i) interfere materially with or prevent
compliance or continued compliance by the Business with all Environmental Laws
or (ii) give rise to any Liability, including Liability under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as

Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.11 _Real Property_. Sellers own no real property. _Section 3.11_ of
the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all real
property that Sellers lease, use or occupy (the " _Real Property_ "),
including all encumbrances, easements or rights of way of record (or, if not
of record, of which any Seller has actual notice or knowledge) granted on or
appurtenant to or otherwise affecting the Real Property. Except as set forth
in _Section 3.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the use of the Real Property as
currently used is a permitted use by right in the applicable zoning
classification. No public improvements have been commenced and, to Sellers
Knowledge, none are planned that may result in special assessments against or
otherwise materially adversely affect any Real Property. Seller has received
no written notice of a (i) planned or proposed increase in assessed valuations
of any Real Property, (ii) Order requiring repair, alteration or correction of
any existing condition affecting any Real Property or the systems or
improvements thereat or (iii) condition or defect that could give rise to an
Order of the type described in _subclause (ii)_. To Sellers Knowledge, there
is no existing, proposed or contemplated plan to construct, modify or realign
any street, highway, power line or pipeline that would adversely affect the
current or planned use or occupancy of any Real Property.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Title to and Condition of Properties_.

 



 

(a) _Title_. Sellers have good and marketable title to (or, as applicable, a
valid and subsisting leasehold interest or license rights in) all of the
Purchased Assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and
those Liens set forth in _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Except
for those assets that are subject to the personal property leases set forth in
_Section 3.14_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Sellers have good and marketable
title to all of the Purchased Assets. None of the Purchased Assets is subject
to any restrictions with respect to the transferability or divisibility
thereof or any right to recovery by any previous owner of such property under
any theory of Law or contractual right. No Seller is using any assets that are
not owned, licensed or leased by it. At the Closing, Buyer will receive good
and marketable title to (or, as applicable, a valid and subsisting leasehold
interest or license rights in) all of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens and Liens created by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) _Condition_. All equipment, machinery and other operating assets
constituting Purchased Assets, as well as all buildings, plants and other
structures (including all fixtures and systems located thereon) owned or

generally followed in the industry.

 



 

Section 3.13 _Insurance_. _Section 3.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a correct and complete list of all policies of insurance in effect with
respect to Sellers and their respective business, assets or Liabilities
(collectively, the " _Insurance Policies_ "). All of the Insurance Policies

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (b) laws relating to the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable

that could result in cancellation of any Insurance Policy prior to its
scheduled expiration date. None of the insurance carriers providing coverage
under the Insurance Policies has declared bankruptcy or provided notice of
insolvency to any Seller. To Sellers Knowledge, each Seller has duly and
timely made all claims that it has been entitled to make under the Insurance
Policies. There is no claim by any Seller pending under any Insurance Policy
as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies, and to Sellers Knowledge, there is no basis
for denial of any pending claim under any Insurance Policy. Since January 1,
2006, all products liability and general liability Insurance Policies
maintained by or for the benefit of any Seller have been "occurrence" policies
and not "claims made" policies. The Trust has delivered correct and complete

Section 3.15 _No Default_. No Seller is in default in any material respect
under any Assumed Contract, nor has any event or omission occurred that,
through the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute
a default in any material respect thereunder or cause the acceleration of any
Sellers obligations thereunder or result in the creation of any Lien on any
of the Purchased Assets. To Sellers Knowledge, no third party is in default
in any material respect under any Assumed Contract, nor has any event or
omission occurred that, through the passage of time or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute a default in any material respect thereunder or give
rise to an automatic termination or right of discretionary termination
thereof. Each Assumed Contract is in full force and effect and is a valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Seller that is party thereto and, to
Sellers Knowledge, the other party or parties thereto in accordance with its
terms.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.16 _Labor Matters_. No employees of any Seller are legally organized
or recognized as a labor organization or represented by any labor union, labor
organization or works council with respect to their employment with such
Seller, and no question concerning representation is threatened relating to

labor disputes, any union organization attempts or any work stoppages due to
labor disagreements. There is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint
pending or threatened against any Seller. There is no labor strike, slowdown,

Section 3.18 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Disclosure_. _Section 3.18(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
correct and complete list of all "employee benefit plans," as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ "), and all other employee compensation and benefit
programs, funds, plans or Contracts that are maintained by any Seller, or to
which any Seller is obligated to contribute, for current or former directors,
managers, officers or employees with respect to which any Seller has or may
have any liability, or that otherwise cover any employees of the Business,
including any deferred-compensation, equity-based, retirement, retention,
welfare-benefit, medical insurance or hospitalization, death benefit, life
insurance, disability, insurance, severance, salary continuation,
unemployment, savings, vacation, cafeteria, bonus, incentive or fringe benefit
program, plan, policy, arrangement or Contract, whether or not reduced to

that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple
Employer Plan") and to which any Seller contributes or has an obligation to
contribute, and no Seller nor any Person who could be considered a single
employer with any Seller has ever maintained or been obligated to contribute
to any such multiemployer plan or Multiple Employer Plan or otherwise has any
Liability, contingent or otherwise, with respect to any such plan. None of the
Benefit Plans is or ever has been a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and neither any Seller nor any Person who could be
considered a single employer with any Seller has any Liability, contingent or
otherwise, with respect to a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code. No Benefit Plan provides medical or dental benefits with respect
to current or former directors, officers, managers or employees of any Seller
beyond their termination of employment, other than (i) coverage mandated by
Sections 601 et seq. of ERISA and 4980B(f) of the Code or similar state Law,

form and operation with its own terms and applicable Law in all material
respects, Sellers, to the extent due, have timely made all required
contributions thereto, each fiduciary of each Benefit Plan who is an employee

applicable Laws with respect thereto and each fiduciary of each Benefit Plan
who is not an employee or director of any Seller has, to Sellers Knowledge,
complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws with respect
thereto; (ii) all material notices, reports and information relating to the
Benefit Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or provided to
participants or their beneficiaries have been timely filed and provided, and
the information included therein was correct and complete in all material
respects; (iii) there is no Litigation pending (other than routine claims for
benefits being reviewed pursuant to the plans internal claim and approval
process) or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Benefit
Plan or against the assets of any Benefit Plan nor has there been in the past
six years any material dispute with or investigation by any Governmental
Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan; (iv) no Benefit Plan is or has been
within the three years prior to the date hereof been the subject of an
examination, inquiry or audit by a governmental authority; (v) each Benefit

favorable IRS determination letter (issued with respect to its most recently
completed remedial amendment period) as to the tax-qualified status of the

letter and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to affect
adversely the qualified status of such

 



      
 

 



 

Benefit Plan; (vi) to Sellers Knowledge, no Person has engaged in a non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code; and (vii) Sellers and the relevant plan administrator if
applicable have at all relevant times properly classified each provider of
services to Sellers as an employee, temporary employee or independent
contractor, as the case may be, for all purposes relating to each Benefit Plan
and Law for which such classification could be relevant.

 



 

(e) _Certain Payments_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.18(e)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in connection with any
other event) will trigger severance, increased compensation or benefits,
acceleration of payment or vesting of benefits, or the funding of any trusts,
in respect of any current or former directors, managers, officers or employees
of any Seller, or limit or restrict the ability of Buyer or its affiliates to
merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan.

 



 

(f) _No Other Binding Commitments_. No Seller has any announced plan or
legally binding commitment to create any additional Benefit Plans or to amend
or modify any existing Benefit Plans.

 



 

(g) _Deferred Compensation_. None of the Benefit Plans is a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan that fails to meet the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code or that is not, or has not been, operated in accordance with such
requirements.

 



 

Section 3.19 _Intellectual Property_. _Section 3.19_ of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all Seller Intellectual
Property owned or exclusively licensed by each Seller (to the extent
susceptible to listing). _Section 3.19_ of the Disclosure Schedule also

Intellectual Property is in good standing, and those shown as registered in
_Section 3.19_ of the Disclosure Schedule have been registered in all
jurisdictions where required, which jurisdictions are set forth in _Section
3.19_ of the Disclosure Schedule. All registrations and applications have been
properly made and filed, and all annuity, maintenance, renewal and other fees
relating to registrations or applications are current. All Intellectual
Property rights that are used by Sellers are valid, enforceable and in good
standing. There are no equitable defenses to enforcement of any Intellectual
Property rights used by Sellers that are based on any act or omission of
Sellers. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not impair any rights of Sellers in, to or under any Seller Intellectual
Property. No Seller has granted any license or made any assignment of any of
the Seller Intellectual Property owned by it, and no Person other than Sellers
has any right to use any Seller Intellectual Property owned by Sellers. No
Seller pays any royalties or other consideration for the right to use any
Intellectual Property rights of others. No Seller requires any Intellectual
Property rights that such Seller does not already own or license in order to
conduct its business as currently conducted. To Sellers Knowledge, there is
no pending infringement or misappropriation by others of Intellectual Property
rights owned or used by any Seller. Use of Seller Intellectual Property does
not infringe on or misappropriate Intellectual Property rights of others. No
methods, processes, procedures, apparatus or equipment, used or held for use
by any Seller use or include any proprietary or confidential information or
any trade secrets

 



      
 

 



 

misappropriated from another. No Seller has any proprietary or confidential
information that is owned or claimed by other Persons and that is not
rightfully in the possession of such Seller, and each Seller has complied in
all material respects with all Contracts governing the disclosure and use of
proprietary or confidential information. Sellers have maintained the
confidentiality of the Seller Intellectual Property to the extent necessary to
maintain all proprietary rights therein.

distributors, of Sellers (taken as a whole) for each of the two most recent
fiscal years (determined on the basis of the total dollar amount of net sales)

such year and whether such customer is an Affiliate or a third party. To

purchases and pricing as heretofore.

amount of purchases from each such supplier during each such year and whether
such supplier is an Affiliate or third party. To Sellers Knowledge, none of
the suppliers described in _Section 3.20(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule will
cease to continue to supply the Business (as owned by Buyer) with goods and
services as heretofore in the same quantities and at competitive prices, to
the extent Buyer so requests such goods and services.

 



 

(c) _Dealers_. No Seller has any engagement or other relationship with any
sales representative, dealer, distributor or franchisee or other third party
performing similar functions for such Seller, and no Seller has terminated any
such engagement or other relationship in the previous six years.

 



 

Section 3.21 _Product Warranty and Product Liability_. _Section 3.21_ of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete copy of each Sellers
standard warranty or warranties for sales of Products/Services, and except as
expressly set forth therein, there are no warranties (statutory or otherwise),
deviations from standard warranties or commitments or obligations with respect
to the return, repair, replacement or re-performance of Products/Services
under which any Seller will have any Liability. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.21_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending warranty
claims involving any Seller. Voluntary concessions or payments by Sellers not
charged to warranty expense as an accommodation to customers that have claimed
that a Product/Service is defective or nonconforming have been less than
$10,000 in the aggregate in the last twelve months. None of the
Products/Services has been the subject of any replacement, field fix,
retrofit, modification or recall campaign, and to Sellers Knowledge, no facts
or conditions exist that would reasonably be expected to result in any such
campaign.

 **ARTICLE 6 
CERTAIN ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Access to Information; Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) _Access to Information_. After the Closing, each Party shall afford any
other Party and its respective Representatives, during normal business hours,
reasonable access to the books, records and other information in such Partys
possession or control relating to the Business with respect to periods prior
to the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom at its
expense, to the extent such access is reasonably required by the requesting
Party for any proper business purpose.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation_. Each Party shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other Party, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns
relating to the Business and (ii) any Litigation (including insurance claims)
brought by or against any third party in connection with (A) any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) any fact or condition relating to the
Business. As and to the extent Buyer reasonably requests, the Trust shall
cause each Utility Seller to, and DTUENY shall, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from any Person any certificate or other document that may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on
Buyer and/or in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Adversarial Proceedings_. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section
6.1_, although the existence of a Dispute or other adversarial proceeding
between or among any of the Parties shall not abrogate or suspend the
provisions of this _Section 6.1_, as to such records or other information
directly pertinent to such Dispute or other adversarial proceeding, the
Parties may not utilize this _Section 6.1_ but rather, absent agreement, must
utilize the rules of discovery.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Employment_. All employees of Sellers identified in _Section 3.17_ of
the Disclosure Schedule who are in active employment status as of the Closing
(collectively, the " _Active Transferred Employees_ ") shall cease their
employment status with Sellers as of the Closing Date and simultaneously
therewith Buyer shall offer employment to each such Active Transferred
Employee on such terms and conditions as are comparable, in the aggregate, to
those provided by Sellers. Buyer will assume liability for all accrued
vacation benefits, if any, for each Active Transferred Employee and Non-Active
Transferred Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment, but only to the
extent such liability is accrued on the face of the Final Closing Statement.
For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, for each
Active Transferred Employee and Non-Active Transferred Employee who accepts
employment with Buyer on the Closing Date, continue or provide bonus and
incentive cash compensation opportunities, and a base salary or hourly wage
rate, that shall be comparable, in the aggregate, to such opportunities and
salary or wage rate provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date; provided that nothing herein shall require Buyer to continue the
employment of any "at will" Active Transferred Employee or Non-Active
Transferred Employee for any period or to provide salary or wage continuation
in the event such employment is terminated. For purposes of this _Section
6.2(a)_, the term "active employment status" includes any individual not
actively at work due to illness, short-term disability or sick leave,
authorized leave of absence, layoff for lack of work or service in the Armed
Forces of the United States but does not include any individual not actively
at work due to retirement, resignation, permanent dismissal or long-term
disability. In addition, Buyer shall extend an employment offer to any
employees of Sellers identified in _Section 3.17_ of the Disclosure Schedule
who are not Active Transferred Employees in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.2(a)_ (collectively, the " _Non-Active
Transferred Employees_ ") but who have a right to return to employment under
the applicable policies of Sellers or pursuant to any applicable Law or Order
at the time such employees are eligible to return to work or additional
employment in the applicable job classification is deemed warranted by Buyer.
If any Non-Active Transferred Employee is employed by Buyer pursuant to the
preceding sentence, then such Non-Active Transferred Employee shall become an
Active Transferred Employee for purposes of this Agreement as of the date of
such employment. Prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent necessary to
implement this sentence, Sellers shall cause to be taken all actions as may be
reasonably required to amend any Benefit Plan and take or cause to be taken
all other action as may be reasonably required to provide that severance or
separation payments shall not be payable to any Active Transferred Employee on
account of such employees termination of employment with Sellers. Each Seller
shall use, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use, its best efforts to keep
available the services of its present employees through the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the Closing, Sellers will assign and
Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) shall assume, sponsorship of the Benefit
Plans, including without limitation all policies of insurance, third-party
recordkeeping service agreements, investment management contracts, and/or all
assets held in trust relating to such Plans, and Sellers shall obtain any
applicable consents from third parties and take any other actions necessary
for such assignment. For purpose of clarification, Buyer shall retain the
right to assert a claim for indemnification as provided under _Article 8_ of
this Agreement for any breach of Sellers representation and warranties in
_Section 3.18_, and the assignment of such Benefit Plans to Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall not be deemed to result in Buyers assumption of
liabilities arising from any such breach. Subject to _Section 6.2(a)_, this
_Section 6.2(b)_ shall not prevent Buyer from amending, changing or
terminating any of the Benefit Plans. With respect to any benefits provided by
Sellers, each Active Transferred Employee for purposes of any benefit plan,
program or arrangement maintained for the benefit of former Seller employees
at any time after the Closing Date, each Active Transferred Employee shall
receive credit (as reported by Sellers to Buyer) for service with the Sellers
prior to the Closing, to the same extent such service was credit or creditable
under a similar Benefit Plan, for eligibility to participate, vesting and
benefit accrual (except where doing so would cause a duplication of benefits).
Buyer shall also (x) cause any and all pre-existing conditions (or actively at
work or similar limitations), eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group health plans to be waived with
respect to such employees and their eligible dependents and (y) provide them
with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar
payments) made during the plan year to the extent reflected in records
provided to Buyer for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible,
out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements in which they are eligible to participate after the
Closing Date; provided in each case that, with respect to any Benefit Plan
that is insured, the applicable insurance carrier consents to such actions, if
such consent is required.

 



 

(c) _Termination Benefits_. If any action on the part of any Seller or the
Trust on or prior to the Closing Date, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or Buyers failure to hire as an employee of
Buyer any employee of a Seller shall result in any Liability (other than an
Assumed Liability or a Liability arising as a result of Buyers breach of this
Agreement) (i) for severance payments or other employment termination benefits
or (ii) by virtue of any "plant closing" or other Law, then such Liability
shall be the sole responsibility of, and shall be paid by, the Trust and
DTUENY.

 



 

(d) _COBRA_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of COBRA, it is
a "successor employer" as defined in regulations under Code Section 4980B and
agrees that it will assume all of Sellers obligations to provide COBRA
continuation coverage with respect to all employees of the Utility Sellers and
their covered dependents who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in
Treasury Reg. 54.4980B-9 or other applicable regulations under Code Section
4980B.

 



 

(e) _Payroll Tax_. The Parties agree that, with respect to Active Transferred
Employees who accept employment with Buyer as of the Closing Date, (i) each
Seller and Buyer respectively meet the definition of "predecessor" and
"successor" as defined in Revenue Procedure 2004-53, (ii) for purposes of
reporting employee compensation to the IRS on Forms W-2 and W-3 for the
calendar year in which the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date occurs, each Seller and Buyer shall utilize the "Alternative
Procedure" described in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53 and (iii) for
purposes of reporting employee compensation for Federal Insurance
Contributions Act purposes for the calendar year within which the Closing Date
occurs, each Seller meets the definition of "predecessor" and Buyer meets the
definition of "successor" as defined in the IRS Regulation Section
31.3121(a)(1)-(b). The Trust shall cause each Utility Seller to, and DTUENY
shall, supply Buyer, with respect to all Active Transferred Employees, all
cumulative payroll information as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall not assume any Liability with respect to such
cumulative payroll information, and all such Liabilities shall be the sole
responsibility of the Trust and DTUENY. The Trust and DTUENY shall cause all
such Liabilities to be paid as and when due. Each Party shall cooperate in
good faith to adopt, or to cause to be adopted, similar procedures under
applicable state, municipal, county, local or other Laws.

 



 

(f) _Consent to Employment_. For all purposes, the Trust, on behalf of all
Utility Sellers, and DTUENY consent to Buyers employment of all Active
Transferred Employees that Buyer employs on or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) _No Additional Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall (i) confer upon any employee of any Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
any representative of any such employee, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any period or terms of
employment, for any nature whatsoever, or (ii) be interpreted to prevent or
restrict the Buyer or any of its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the
employment or terms of employment of any Active Transferred Employee,
including the amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation
plan, program or arrangement, after the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Tax Matters_.

that Sellers are required to file and to be paid all Taxes due and payable on

accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060 of the Code. For
this purpose, the Parties agree that the methodology for determining the fair
market value of the Purchased Assets (or groups of such assets) is set forth
in _Exhibit 6.3(c)_. No later than 90 days following the final determination
of Net Working Capital, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a proposed
allocation of the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the principles set forth on _Exhibit 6.3(c)_ (as finally determined and
subject to any adjustments thereto, each in accordance with this _Section
6.3(b)_, the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The procedures provided in
_Sections 2.5(a)_ and _2.5(b)_ shall apply for purposes of resolving any
disputes relating to the proposed Purchase Price Allocation or any amendment
thereto delivered by Buyer to Sellers pursuant to this _Section 6.3_. The
Parties shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to
IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation.

 



      
 

 



 

Each Party shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all
such documents, forms and other information as any other Party reasonably
requests to prepare in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation. All
payments pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, _Section 2.2(f)_ or _ARTICLE 8_
shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise

applicable Law.

Buyer to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) such Taxes, to the
extent reasonably requested.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation_. Each Party shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns relating to the Business or the transfers contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party further agrees, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or other
Person or entity as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 



 

(e) _Property Taxes_. All Taxes imposed with respect to personal property ("

6.3(d)_, the applicable Party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no

Tax Returns and similar reports and to otherwise wind up and conclude its
business. Concurrently with the Closing, the Trust shall cause each Utility
Seller to, and DTUENY shall, (a) change its legal name to a new name bearing

documents as Buyer reasonably requests to effect such transfer.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Other Warranty_. After the Closing, Buyer shall notify Appointed
Agent of its receipt of any claim asserting warranty obligations arising from
or involving Products/Services that do not constitute Assumed Warranty
Liabilities (collectively, " _Other Warranty_ "). Buyer shall administer,

and DTUENY shall reimburse Buyer and its Affiliates, at cost, for all expenses
and other amounts incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the
administration, satisfaction and/or discharge of any Liability arising from

_Third Party Claim_ "):

 



 

(a) _Notice_. The Person or Persons seeking to be indemnified (whether one or
more, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall provide the Party or Parties from
whom indemnification is sought (whether one or more, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") with written notice of the Third Party Claim promptly after its
receipt of service or other notice in respect thereof. Failure to provide
notice of the Third Party Claim shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys
duties or obligations under this _ARTICLE 8_, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) _Defense_. The Indemnifying Party may undertake and control the defense of
the Third Party Claim, by representatives chosen by it, if the Indemnifying
Party admits that it has an indemnification obligation hereunder with respect
to the Third Party Claim, in which case such assumption shall constitute the
Indemnifying Partys undertaking to pay directly all costs, expenses, damages,
judgments, awards, penalties, assessments and other Liabilities incurred in
connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes such defense, then
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. So long as the Indemnifying
Party is defending the Third Party Claim actively and in good faith, the

written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) shall make available
to the Indemnifying Party or its representatives all records and other
materials reasonably required, and in the possession or under the control of
the Indemnified Party, for the use of the Indemnifying Party and its

after notice of the Third Party Claim, fails to defend the Third Party Claim
actively and in good faith, then the Indemnified Party shall (upon further
notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of
the Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to
the Third Party Claim, on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter have no right
to challenge the Indemnified Partys defense, compromise, settlement or
consent to judgment.

 



 

(d) _Indemnified Party s Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _ARTICLE 8_, (i) if there is a reasonable probability that any Third
Party Claim may adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result
of money damages or other monetary payments, if any Third Party Claim involves
a demand for money damages or other monetary payments that exceed the
Indemnifying Partys then current indemnification obligations under this
_ARTICLE 8_ (giving effect to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE 8_)
of if any Third Party Claim involves any criminal claim, inquiry or
investigation, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to

 



      
 

 



 

defend, compromise or settle the Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
judgment with respect to the Third Party Claim, provided that the Indemnified
Party shall not compromise or settle the Third Party Claim, or consent to the
entry of judgment with respect to the Third Party Claim, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of judgment with
respect to, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Indemnified Party any amount due under this _ARTICLE 8_. Upon judgment,
determination, settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay promptly on behalf of the Indemnified Party,
and/or to the Indemnified Party in reimbursement of any amount theretofore
required to be paid by it, the amount so determined by judgment,
determination, settlement or compromise and all other Losses of the
Indemnified Party with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party desires to
appeal from an adverse judgment, then the Indemnifying Party shall post and
pay the cost of the security or bond to stay execution of the judgment pending

Section 8.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Except for any willful breach or
willful misrepresentation, as to which claims may be brought without
limitation as to time, amount or otherwise:

 



 

(a) _Time Limitation_. No claim or action shall be brought under this _ARTICLE
8_ for breach of a representation or warranty after the second anniversary of
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement:

 



 

(i) There shall be no time limitation on any claim or action brought for
breach of any representation or warranty made in or pursuant to _Section
3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.12(a)_, _Section 3.24_, _Section 4.1_ or
_Section 4.2_ (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), and the
Parties hereby waive all applicable statutory limitation periods with respect
thereto.

 



 

(ii) Any claim or action brought for breach of any representation or warranty
made in or pursuant to _Section 3.5_ may be brought at any time until the
date that is 30 days after the underlying obligation is barred by the
applicable limitation period under federal and state Laws relating thereto (as
such period may be extended by tolling or waiver).

 



 

(iii) Any claim or action brought for breach of any representation or warranty
made in or pursuant to _Section 3.10(c)_ or _Section 3.18_ may be brought at
any time until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(iv) Any claim or action made by an Indemnified Party by delivering notice to
the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period for such claim or action shall be preserved despite the subsequent
expiration of such survival period.

 



       
 

 



 

(v) If any act, omission, disclosure or failure to disclose shall form the
basis for a claim or action for breach of more than one representation or
warranty and such claims have different periods of survival hereunder, then
the expiration of the survival period of one claim or action shall not affect
an Indemnified Partys right to make a claim or action based on the breach of
representation or warranty still surviving.

 



 

(b) _Deductible Limitation_. Except with respect to claims for breaches of any
Fundamental Representation (as to which the limitation set forth in this
_Section 8.5(b)_ shall not apply), an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled
to indemnification under this _ARTICLE 8_ for Losses with respect to breaches
of representations and/or warranties unless the aggregate amount of all Losses
related to any and all breaches of representations and/or warranties (but for
this _Section 8.5(b)_) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
$1,250,000 (the " _Deductible_ "); and in such event, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification in full for all Losses related to
breaches of representations and/or warranties to the extent in excess of the
Deductible.

 



 

(c) _Amount Limitation_. Except with respect to claims for breaches of any
Fundamental Representation (as to which the limitation in this _Section
8.5(c)_ shall not apply), the aggregate amount of all Losses paid by an
Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE 8_ with respect to breaches of
representations and/or warranties shall not exceed $30,000,000.

 



 

(d) _Insurance Offset_. The obligation of an Indemnifying Party to indemnify
an Indemnified Party for Losses under this _ARTICLE 8_ for breaches of
representations and/or warranties shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party from third party insurers
with respect to such Losses. The Indemnified Party shall undertake good faith
efforts to make and pursue reasonable claims against third party insurers with
respect to such Losses, provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be
required to commence or otherwise participate in any Litigation in respect of
any such claims.

 



 

(e) _Mitigation Offset_. An Indemnifying Party shall not have liability for
Losses under this _ARTICLE 8_ for breaches of representations and/or
warranties to the extent the Indemnified Party fails to mitigate such Losses
in the manner required by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _General_. The limitations set forth in this _Section 8.5_ shall not
limit the obligation of any Party to provide indemnification from and against
Losses arising from any breach of a covenant, even if such breach also
constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty. Without limitation, the
obligations of the Trust and DTUENY to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
from and against Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification under _subclause (b)_ or _(c)_ of _Section 8.1_ shall
not be affected by the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.5_. With
respect to Losses for which the Trust and/or DTUENY is required to provide
indemnification under this _ARTICLE 8_ for breaches of representations and/or
warranties, the limitations set forth in _Section 8.5(b)_ and _Section
8.5(c)_ shall be applied as though the Trust and DTUENY, taken together,
constitute the Indemnifying Party.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.6 _Materiality Qualifiers_. The Parties agree that, for purposes of
this _ARTICLE 8_, in determining whether any representation or warranty set
forth in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.4(a)_ and _subclause (b)(i)_ of _Section 3.8_) has been
breached and for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting
therefrom, any and all "Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects,"
"materiality" and similar exceptions and qualifiers set forth in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Escrow of Disputed Amounts_. If a Buyer Indemnified Party in good
faith believes that the Trust or DTUENY has failed to pay amounts due such
Buyer Indemnified Party, including any amounts that the Trust or DTUENY is
obligated to pay pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in this
_ARTICLE 8_, at a time that there are amounts then due and owing from Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to the Trust, DTUENY or any of their respective
Affiliates, including any earned but unpaid amount otherwise payable pursuant
to _Section 2.2(e)_ or _Section 2.2(f)_, then such Buyer Indemnified Party
may, in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available,
deliver to the Escrow Agent (or a successor escrow agent) the amount to which
such Buyer Indemnified Party believes it is entitled out of the amounts then
due and owing the Trust, DTUENY or any of their respective Affiliates, such
amount to be held in escrow by such Escrow Agent (or a successor escrow agent)
until resolution, by settlement or otherwise, of the parties respective
entitlement to the amount so held.

 



 

Section 8.8 _No Waiver_. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver by any Party of its rights to
indemnification hereunder, regardless of whether the Indemnified Party has
knowledge of the basis of the Loss at or prior to the Closing. No
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or in any
schedule or exhibit attached hereto or any document or instrument executed and
delivered pursuant hereto shall merge into the deeds, bill of sale,
assignments, documents, agreements and instruments to be delivered at the
Closing.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provisions of this
_ARTICLE 8_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Parties
with respect to all claims arising out of or relating to the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
provisions of this _Section 8.9_ shall not apply to claims based on fraud or
affect the ability of a Party to seek equitable relief, including specific
performance, of a covenant set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9

 **ARTICLE 10 
TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 10.1 _General_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing only as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Appointed Agent;

 



 

(b) by Buyer or Appointed Agent if (i) a Law shall have been enacted, entered
or promulgated prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby substantially on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) an
Order shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or issued by a
Governmental Entity permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement substantially on the terms contemplated hereby, and such Order shall
have become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _subclause (ii)_ shall
have used commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Order, or (iii) a
Governmental Entity shall have failed to issue an Order or take any other
action, and such denial of a request to issue such Order or take such other
action shall have become final and non-appealable, that is necessary to
satisfy any condition set forth in _ARTICLE 7_; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _subclause (iii)_ shall
not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with _Section 5.3_ has
been the cause of such inaction; and provided further that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall apply only
if the Law, Order or act or omission of the Governmental Entity, as the case
may be, shall have caused the failure of any condition set forth in _ARTICLE
7_ to be satisfied and the Party entitled to rely on such condition shall not
elect to waive such condition;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by Buyer or Appointed Agent if the Closing shall not have occurred on or

days to the extent necessary to obtain those approvals of Governmental
Entities that are required to satisfy the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(f)_ and _Section 7.2(e)_ and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant this _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to any Party that has
breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any
manner that shall have caused the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated on or before the Termination Date;

 



 

(d) by Appointed Agent if all of the following shall have occurred: (i) Buyer
shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement, (ii)
such breach or failure to perform is reasonably expected to result in any
condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ to not be satisfied and (iii) such
breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured by Buyer prior to the
date that is 15 days after receipt of written notice thereof or, if such
breach or failure to perform is capable of being so cured, Buyer shall not
have cured such breach or failure to perform within 15 days after receipt of

this Agreement on the part of the Parties; provided, however, that (a) the
provisions of _ARTICLE 11_ shall remain in full force and effect and (b)
termination shall not relieve any Party from liabilities for Losses incurred

material breach of any of such Partys representations, warranties or
covenants set forth in this Agreement.

for any act taken or omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement or the

(c) _Indemnity_. The Trust and DTUENY shall indemnify and hold harmless
Appointed Agent from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred

and several obligations.

Schedule_ ") and delivered them to Buyer immediately prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement. No representation or warranty set forth in
this Agreement shall be qualified or otherwise affected by any fact or item
disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Schedule unless such representation
or warranty is expressly qualified by reference to such section of the
Disclosure Schedule, and any fact or item disclosed in any section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in all other sections of the
Disclosure Schedule to which such fact or item may reasonably apply so long as
such disclosure is in sufficient detail to enable a reasonable person to
identify the other section or subsection of this Agreement to which such
information is responsive. The Disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule shall not vary, change or alter the language of the representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and to the extent the language in
the Disclosure Schedule does not conform to the language of such
representations and warranties, such language shall be disregarded and be of
no force or effect.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Publicity_. The Parties agree that no public release or
announcement relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be issued or made by or on behalf of any Party without the prior written
consent of Buyer and Appointed Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may,
in the reasonable judgment of the releasing Party, be required by Law or any
rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which securities of the
releasing Party (or an Affiliate thereof) are listed, in which case the Party
required to make (or whose Affiliate is required to make) the release or
announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Each Party (including the Trust on behalf
of itself and each Utility Seller) hereby waives compliance by the other
Parties with the provisions of the bulk transfer Law, bulk sales Law or
similar Law of any jurisdiction with respect to the transactions contemplated

Section 11.7 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign, transfer or encumber this
Agreement, or its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part,
voluntarily or by operation of Law (including by virtue of a merger or similar
transaction), without the prior written consent of Buyer and Appointed Agent,
and any attempted assignment, transfer or encumbrance without such consent
shall be void and without effect.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
heirs, personal representatives, permitted successors and permitted assigns.
Except for the provisions of _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ (and related
provisions of _ARTICLE 8_), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. Without
limitation, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon
any Person any right relating in any way to employment or terms of employment
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Law Governing Agreement; Consent to Jurisdiction; No Jury
Trial_. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any choice of law rules that may
direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Each Party
stipulates that if there is any dispute or disagreement between or among any
of the Parties as to the interpretation of any provision of, or the
performance of obligations under, this Agreement (a " _Dispute_ "), such
Dispute shall be commenced and prosecuted in its entirety in, and each Party
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and proper venue of, the Delaware Court
of Chancery (unless such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in which
case, in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware). Each
Party consents to personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue in such
courts and waives and relinquishes all right to attack the suitability or
convenience of such venue or forum by reason of their present

 



      
 

 



 

or future domiciles or by any other reason. The Parties acknowledge that all
directions issued by the forum court, including all injunctions and other
decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all jurisdictions and countries.
Each Party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any Dispute.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, then all
other provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement in order to carry out the original intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated
as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only
pursuant to a written instrument executed and delivered by Buyer and Appointed
Agent; provided, however, Buyer, in its discretion, may require the execution
of any such amendment, modification or supplement by the Trust and DTUENY.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Waiver_. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be effective unless expressly set forth in a written
instrument executed by the Party so waiving. Except to the extent set forth in
the preceding sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein and in any documents
delivered or to be delivered pursuant hereto and in connection with the
Closing hereunder. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Notice_. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be

recognized private overnight courier service as follows:
