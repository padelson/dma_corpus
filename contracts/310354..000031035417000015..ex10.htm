Article 7A.1

 

Tax Returns

 



 

On the Closing Date, the Target Group will leave the Sellers tax consolidated
group and file corporate income and consumption tax returns for the period
ending on the date prior to the Closing Date. The Seller shall be responsible
for preparing and filing all income tax returns with respect to the activity
of the Target Group for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period), and the Seller hereby covenants and agrees
to pay all income taxes shown on such income tax returns. Since Target
Company has a joint tax liability with respect to the national corporate
income tax liabilities of the Sellers tax consolidated group, the Target
Company can charge to the Seller any taxes the Target Company paid due to the
joint tax liability, and such right includes national corporate income taxes
for the period for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 or earlier.

 



 

Article 7A.2

 

Tax Proceedings

 



 

In the event that the Purchaser or any of its affiliates, including the Target
Group, receives any oral or written communication regarding any pending or
threatened examination, audit, claim, adjustment or other proceeding with
respect to the liability of the Target Group or the Seller for taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Tax Claim"), the Purchaser will, within twenty (20)
days, notify the Seller in writing thereof (provided, however, that any
failure by Purchaser to provide timely written notice shall not prejudice
Purchasers entitlement to indemnification so long as Purchaser can
demonstrate that (i) Seller was aware of such Tax Claim within such notice
period or (ii) the failure to provide timely notice has not prejudiced
Sellers ability to contest any such Tax Claim). If the Seller is liable
under this Agreement for such taxes, the Seller will be entitled, at the
Sellers sole expense and with counsel of its own choosing to control or
settle the contest of any Tax Claim. The Seller will keep the Purchaser fully
and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
Tax Claim. The Purchaser and its affiliates, including the Target Group, will
cooperate fully with the Seller in handling any such Tax Claim. 

 

Article 7A.3

 

Cooperation on Tax Matters

 



 

The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate fully in connection with the
filing of tax returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to taxes, including, without limitation, by providing or causing to be
provided to the Seller any powers of attorney that the Seller reasonably
requests for the purposes of filing any income tax return or participating in
any proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the

litigation, or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

returns with respect to the activity of the Target Group for any taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b) voluntarily approach any
taxing authority regarding any taxes or tax returns with respect to the

liability for the Target Group or the Seller for any taxable period ending on

TSA Related Services

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
 

This exhibit sets forth the principles and main terms upon which the parties
have agreed regarding the provision of transition services by the Seller and
the payment for such services by the Target Company and/or the Purchaser as of
the previous day of the Execution Date. The parties will continue to work
together to further refine such terms (which may include the addition of
additional transitional services items as the parties identify and mutually
agree) as the actual Transition Services Agreement is drafted between the
Execution Date of the SPA and the Closing. While the parties shall continue
to negotiate the fees associated with such transition services in good faith,
the parties agree that, excepting where no fee was charged historically at
all, such fees will not exceed the fees charged by Seller and its affiliates
to the Target Company for the same or similar services as reflected in the
most recent Financial Statements.
