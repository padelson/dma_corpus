Agreement, the Company and Newco are entering into an agreement (the
"Restructuring Agreement") pursuant to which, prior to the Effective Time, the

                  WHEREAS the Company and Parent intend to treat the exchange of
Company Common Stock for cash and the exchange of Company Common Stock for Newco
Common Stock as a single integrated transaction comprising a taxable sale or
exchange of Company Common Stock as described in Section 1001 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and a complete redemption of the
remaining Company Common Stock owned by the relevant shareholders within the
meaning of Section 302(b)(3) of the Code, respectively (the "Intended
Treatment");

                  WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent, the Company and Newco are entering into an agreement (the
"Post-Closing Covenants Agreement") that sets forth certain agreements that will
govern certain matters that may arise following the Effective Time;

                  WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent, Sub, the Company and Newco are entering into an agreement

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   The Merger

in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements (as defined in Section 10.03) are referred to in this
Agreement collectively as the "Transactions".

                  SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, 825
Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day
following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law (as defined in
Section 4.05(a)), waiver by the applicable party or parties) of the conditions
set forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing but subject to the
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by the applicable party
or parties) of such conditions); provided, however, that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VIII shall not have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the applicable party or parties) on such second
business day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on
which all such conditions shall have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted
by Law, waived by the applicable party or parties). The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

                  SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall prepare, and, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of
State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective
being the "Effective Time").

                  SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. (a)
The certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior

follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the
corporation shall have authority to issue is 100,000 shares of Common Stock, par
value $0.001 per share", and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

                  (b) The by-laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

                  SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,

to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until

<PAGE>

                                                                               6

                  (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent- Owned Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any
subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Sub) shall automatically be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.(i) Subject to Sections
2.01(b), 2.01(d) and 2.02(e), (A) a portion of each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive, from the
Company, one (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable share of Newco
Common Stock in exchange for such portion of each share of Company Common Stock
that is equal in value to the Newco Common Stock received and (B) the remaining
portion of each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive, from Parent or Sub, an amount in cash equal
to the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration.

                     (ii) The shares of Newco Common Stock and the cash amount
         payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
         to this Section 2.01(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco
         Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(e) are referred to
         collectively as the "Merger Consideration". As of the Effective Time,
         all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
         and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
         exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
         Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
         thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration and any
         dividends or other distributions to which such

<PAGE>

                                                                               7

         holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) upon surrender of such
         certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest, and
         except for the right to receive payments to which such holder is
         entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(d), without interest.

                  (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

                  (e) Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding changes (or there is established a record date for
changing) as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, stock dividend, exchange or readjustment of the Company Common
Stock, the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration and the

<PAGE>

                                                                               8

Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, stock dividend, exchange or
readjustment.

                  (f) Withholding Rights. Any of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, Newco or the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.02(a)) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment in accordance
with the Intended Treatment under any provision of Federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts so deducted or withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Taxing Authority (as defined in Section 4.19(f)) are
attributable to the portion of the consideration consisting of Newco Common
Stock, then the Surviving Corporation, Newco or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, will be treated as though the applicable payor withheld an appropriate
amount of such consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement and then sold such consideration for an amount
of cash equal to its fair market value at the time of such deemed sale and paid
such cash proceeds to the appropriate Taxing Authority. All deducted or withheld
amounts described in this Section 2.01(f) shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement, be treated as having been paid to the applicable holder of the
Company Common Stock, Company Convertible Debentures or Company Warrants
(Company Convertible Debentures and Company Warrants, each as defined in Section
4.02(a)), as the case may be, in respect of which the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

                  SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates.(a) Exchange Agent. (i)
As of the Effective Time, the Company shall, or Newco shall, on behalf of the
Company, deposit in trust with a bank or trust company as may be designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, certificates representing the shares of Newco
Common Stock (including all shares of Newco Common Stock owned by the Company at
the Effective Time, whether as a result of the

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

Restructuring or otherwise) issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to this Article II and (ii)
Parent shall from time to time as needed deposit in trust with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash
necessary to pay the cash amount of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.01 in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to this Article II (such shares of Newco Common Stock and cash,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Newco Common Stock and cash
contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Newco Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares)
and the amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until such time as a certificate representing Newco
Common Stock is issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered
Certificate, such Newco Common Stock shall be deemed not outstanding and shall
not be entitled to vote on any

matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the appropriate number of whole shares of Newco Common Stock
(together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) and the appropriate amount of
cash may be issued and paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Newco Common Stock and the payment of cash to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent and Newco that such Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

                  (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Newco Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Certificate with respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder
of the certificate representing whole shares of Newco Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Newco Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Newco Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of Newco Common Stock.

                  (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The
Merger Consideration paid upon the

                                                                              11

surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been
declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

                  (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Newco Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of
a holder of Newco Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 2.02(e), all
fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled as a result
of the conversion of all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder as
of the Effective Time under all Certificates shall be aggregated and
calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

                     (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective
         Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number
         of shares of Newco Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
         Company or Newco pursuant to Section 2.02(a) over (B) the aggregate
         number of whole shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued to holders of
         Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (such excess being
         herein called the "Excess Shares"). As soon after the Effective Time as
         practicable, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company
         Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on

<PAGE>

                                                                              12

         the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"), if the shares of Newco Common Stock
         are quoted on Nasdaq, or otherwise on the national securities exchange
         on which the shares of Newco Common Stock are listed, all in the manner
         provided in Section 2.02(e)(iii).

                     (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent
         shall be executed on the Nasdaq or such national securities exchange,
         as the case may be, and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
         practicable. The proceeds from such sale or sales available for
         distribution to the holders of Company Common Stock shall be reduced by
         the compensation payable to the Exchange Agent and the expenses
         incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case, in connection with such
         sale or sales of the Excess Shares, including all related commissions,
         Transfer Taxes (as defined in Section 7.08) and other out-of-pocket
         transaction costs. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have
         been distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled
         thereto, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such
         holders of Company Common Stock (the "Newco Shares Trust"). The
         Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Newco Shares Trust to
         which each holder of a Certificate shall be entitled, if any, by
         multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the
         Newco Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
         of the fractional share interest in a share of Newco Common Stock to
         which such holder is entitled under Section 2.01(c) (or would be
         entitled but for this Section 2.02(e)) and the denominator of which is
         the aggregate amount of fractional interests in a share of Newco Common
         Stock to which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled.

                     (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the
         amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock
         in lieu of any fractional share interests in Newco Common Stock, the
         Exchange Agent shall in accordance with this Article II, make available
         such amounts, without interest, to the former holders of Company Common
         Stock entitled to receive such cash.

                                                                              13

                  (f) Termination of Exchange Fund and Newco Shares Trust. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates for 9 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered (i) in the
case of shares of Newco Common Stock deposited in the Exchange Fund by the
Company or Newco and cash deposited in the Exchange Fund by Newco, to Newco and
(ii) in the case of cash deposited in the Exchange Fund by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in
each case upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter (x) look only to
Newco for, and Newco shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for Newco
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Newco Common
Stock and (y) look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claim for cash payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(i)(B), in
each case in accordance with this Article II. Any portion of the Newco Shares
Trust that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 9 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Newco, upon demand, and any
holder of the Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Newco for payment of its claim for such cash.

                  (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, Newco or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Newco Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund or the Newco Shares Trust
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the
date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate (or any
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
4.05(b))), any such shares or cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation (with respect to any remaining cash payable pursuant to Section
2.01(c)(i)(B)) and the property of Newco (with respect to any remaining shares
of Newco Common Stock and cash related thereto), free and clear of all

                                                                              14

claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                  (h) Investment of Exchange Fund and the Newco Shares Trust.
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund and
payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(i)(B) as directed by Parent, and any other
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Newco, in each case on a daily
basis. Pending payment of such funds to the holders of Certificates for shares
of Company Common Stock, such funds will be held and shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed in accordance with the previous sentence (so long as
such directions do not impair the rights of holders of Company Common Stock) in
the direct obligations of the United States, obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest or commercial paper rated of the highest quality by
Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation. Parent or
Newco, as applicable, will promptly replace any monies lost through any
investment made in accordance with its instructions pursuant to this Section
2.02(h). If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund or the Newco
Shares Trust is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of the Company
Common Stock shall be entitled under this Article II, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof (with respect to
cash payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(i)(B)) and Newco shall in any event be
liable for payment thereof (with respect to shares of Newco Common Stock and
cash related thereto). The Exchange Fund and the Newco Shares Trust shall not be
used except as provided in this Agreement. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs (with respect to cash payable pursuant to Section
2.01(c)(i)(B)) and to Newco (with respect to any other cash).

                  (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent or Newco, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or Newco may direct as indemnity against any
claim

                                                                              15

that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto) pursuant to this Article II.

                  SECTION 2.03. Company Convertible Debentures. As of and after
the Effective Time, from time to time and at any time upon the conversion of any
Company Convertible Debentures by any holder thereof, (a) Newco shall deliver to
such holder the number of shares of Newco Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Newco Common Stock such holder would have been entitled to
receive as if such holder had converted the Company Convertible Debentures into
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b)
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, deliver to such holder the amount
of cash such holder would have been entitled to receive as if such holder had
converted the Company Convertible Debentures into shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  SECTION 2.04. Company Warrants. As of and after the Effective
Time, from time to time and at any time upon the exercise of any Company
Warrants by any holder thereof, (a) Newco shall deliver to such holder the
number of shares of Newco Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Newco Common Stock as if such holder had exercised the Company Warrant for the
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to, deliver to such holder the amount of cash as if such holder had
exercised the Company Warrant for the shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

contrary, the parties agree that the Damages Payment is made solely with respect
to the monetary damages awarded in the License Litigation as set forth in the
Court of Appeals Opinion (as defined in Section 10.03) and that, except as
provided in the Ongoing Litigation Agreement, neither the Company nor R

waived, given-up, compromised, prejudiced or qualified in any manner (A) the
right of such person to fully prosecute the New Patent Litigation (as defined in
Section 10.03), (B) any rights or interests of such person which are the subject
of the New Patent Litigation or (C) any claim made or to be made by such person,
whether for damages or otherwise, in the New Patent Litigation or (ii) made a
settlement with respect to, waived, given up, compromised, prejudiced or
qualified in any manner any of its other rights or interests under the final
judgment entered by the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland in the License Litigation on February 15, 2002 (the "Final
Judgment")(as modified by the Court of Appeals Opinion) or any final judgment
entered by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland not
inconsistent with the mandate to be returned by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in connection with the Court of Appeals Opinion.

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate or
limited liability company powers, as applicable, governmental licenses and
Consents (as defined in Section 4.05(b)) required to carry on its business as

Transaction Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.03). The Company
has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as amended through the date of this Agreement (as

to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept) and has all corporate

owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all pledges,
claims, liens, charges, encumbrances,

                  SECTION 4.03. Newco. Since the date of its formation, Newco
has not carried on any business or conducted any operation other than the
execution of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements to which it is a
party and the Commercial Agreements (as defined in Section 10.03) to which it is
party, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and matters
ancillary thereto.

                  SECTION 4.04. Authority; Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability. (a) Each of the Company and Newco has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to execute and
deliver (i) each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate
the Transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) each Commercial Agreement to
which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and
delivery by each of the Company and Newco of (A) each Transaction Agreement to
which it is a party and the consummation by each of the Company and Newco of the
Transactions contemplated thereby and (B) each Commercial Agreement to which it
is a party, and the performance by each of the Company and Newco of its
obligations thereunder, in each case have been duly authorized by all

                                                                              21

necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and by all limited
liability company action on the part of Newco, subject, in the case of the
Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section
4.04(c)). Each of the Company and Newco has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement, each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and each
Commercial Agreement to which it is a party, and, assuming due execution and
delivery hereof and thereof by each party hereto and thereto that is not an
affiliate of the Company, this Agreement, each such Transaction Agreement and
each such Commercial Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

                  (b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company
Board"), at a meeting duly called and held, duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, each other Transaction Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) approving each Commercial Agreement and
the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, (iii) determining
that the terms of the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iv) recommending that the
Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement and (v) declaring that this
Agreement is advisable. Assuming the accuracy of Parent's and Sub's
representations and warranties in Section 5.08, such resolutions are sufficient
to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL, and to the Company's knowledge, no other state takeover

         after the Effective Time.

                  (b) Consent. Notwithstanding the second sentence of Section
6.01(a), Parent shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent
with respect to any request by the Company with respect to any action prohibited

6.01(a)(xiii)(solely to the extent relating to actions described in Section
6.01(a)(iv), 6.01(a)(v), 6.01(a)(x), 6.01(a)(xi) or 6.01(a)(xii)).

                  (c) Actions by Parent and the Company. (i) Parent shall not,
and shall not permit any of its affiliates to, take any action that would, or
that is reasonably likely to, result in any condition to the Merger set forth in
Article VIII, not being satisfied.

                     (ii) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
         affiliates to, take any action that would, or that is reasonably likely

solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Company Takeover Proposal
(as defined in Section 6.02(h)), (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to
any Company Takeover Proposal (except a confidentiality agreement in accordance
with this Section 6.02(a)), (iii) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any

directly or indirectly (A) participate in any discussions or negotiations with,
or furnish any information with respect to, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any person that is seeking to make, or has made, any proposal that

to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort by any person that is seeking to make, or has
made, any proposal that constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal; provided,
however, that prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval the Company
and its Representatives may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal that was
not solicited by the Company and that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 6.02(a), and subject to compliance with Sections 6.02(c) and
6.02(d), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement with terms not
materially less favorable to the Company and not materially less restrictive to
the person making such Company Takeover Proposal than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 7.02) and Section 7.12 of this
Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent for informational
purposes only) and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of a revised Company Takeover Proposal) with such person and its
Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal, if and only if, in the
case of each of (x) and (y) above, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after receipt of the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such Company Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Company Proposal (as defined in Section 6.02(h)).

                  (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement or
the Merger, in each case unless the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation

                                                                              48

with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) approve any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to
any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal.

                  (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
Section 9.05(b)(iii), the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 1
business day after receipt of the relevant proposal or inquiry) advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry from a
third party to an officer or director of the Company with respect to the making
of a Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person making any such
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent promptly informed of
the status (including any change to the material terms) of any such Company
Takeover Proposal.

                  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

                  (e) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 6.02,
if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
receives a Superior Company Proposal, then the Company Board may, in accordance
with Section 9.05(b) (including the notice provisions therein), approve and
recommend such Superior Company Proposal and cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement and concurrently enter into a definitive agreement providing for
implementation of such Superior Company Proposal.

                  (f) The Company (i) shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct its Representatives to, cease immediately

terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any persons
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal and (ii) shall promptly request each person, if any, that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date of
this Agreement in connection with such person's consideration of any Company
Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such person by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

                  (g) The Company shall promptly inform the Company Subsidiaries
and its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.02.

                  (h) For purposes of the Transaction Agreements:

                  "Company Takeover Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer
         for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other
         business combination involving the Company, (ii) any proposal or offer
         to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the
         equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company or (iii)
         any other transaction the consummation of which would reasonably be
         expected to impede, prevent or materially delay the Merger, in each
         case other than (A) the Transactions, (B) the performance of
         obligations pursuant to the Commercial Agreements or (C) any
         transaction involving Newco or its subsidiaries that will be
         consummated after the Effective Time.

                  "Superior Company Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited
         written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or
         indirectly, including pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger,
         a consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization or
         similar transaction, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the
         shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding or all or substantially
         all of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
         a whole, on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith to
         be more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
         Transactions

<PAGE>

                                                                              50

         (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
         reputation), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
         proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions
         and conditions to consummation, and this Agreement (including any
         proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Transactions), and for
         which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or
         reasonably determined to be available by the Company Board.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              Additional Agreements

                  SECTION 7.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement, the Newco
Form S-4 and the Newco Form 8-A; Company Stockholders Meeting. (a) As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) prepare
the Proxy Statement, the Newco Form S-4 and the Newco Form 8-A and (ii) file the
Proxy Statement, the Newco Form S-4 and the Newco Form 8-A with the SEC. The
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus in the Newco Form S-4. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Newco
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders
as promptly as practicable after the Newco Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall also take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance
and distribution of Newco Common Stock in the Merger. Parent shall furnish all
information concerning Parent, the Transactions, the Transaction Agreements and
the Commercial Agreements and shall provide all other assistance and cooperation
as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Newco Form
S-4 and any other action described in this Section 7.01(a). The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt

                                                                              51

of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, the Newco Form S-4
or the Newco Form 8-A or for additional information and shall supply each other
with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement, the Newco Form S-4, the Newco Form 8-A, the Merger, the other
Transactions, the Transaction Agreements or the Commercial Agreements. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any such comments or requests of the SEC. If at any
time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur any
event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Newco Form S-4 or the Newco Form 8-A, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, and Parent
shall cooperate in connection therewith. The Company shall not mail any Proxy
Statement, the Newco Form S-4 or the Newco Form 8-A or any amendment or
supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects in a timely manner.

                  (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement (taking into account any delays reasonably required
as a result of the occurrence of any event described in the last sentence of
this clause (b)), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval,
except to the extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Restructuring or the Merger as
permitted by Section 6.02(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 7.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover
Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Restructuring or the Merger.

                  SECTION 7.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The
Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent, and
to Parent's affiliates and their respective officers, employees and
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time to the
Company Records (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement); provided, however,
that such access will not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of the Company and any Company Subsidiary incurred in connection therewith will
be paid by Parent; provided further, however, that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary may withhold (a) any document or information that (i) the disclosure
of which would violate any Contract with a third party or any applicable Law or
Judgment or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-product
protection or (ii) otherwise relates to any litigation (A) between the Company
and any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and any of its
affiliates, on the other hand (including the License Litigation and the New
Patent Litigation), or (B) in which the party requesting such document or
information or any of its affiliates otherwise has an interest, or (b) such
portions of documents or information that its outside counsel advises should not
be disclosed in order to ensure compliance with antitrust or other similar Laws.
Subject to the next two sentences of this Section 7.02, all information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement dated October 8, 2001, between the Company and affiliates of Parent
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and the letter agreement dated November 6,
2002, between the Company and R Diagnostics (the "Letter Agreement"). As of and
after the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall have no further
force and effect and shall be superseded by Section 3.07 of the Post-Closing
Covenants Agreement. As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause its affiliates to, treat all Newco Information (as defined in the
Post-Closing Covenants Agreement), including information exchanged pursuant to
this Section 7.02, as subject to Section 3.07 of the Post-Closing Covenants
Agreement. None of the Company Records provided or received by any party to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations and warranties of the

parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

                  SECTION 7.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other Transactions, including (a) the taking of all acts necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (b) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers and Consents from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain a Consent or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (c) the obtaining of
all necessary Consents or waivers from third parties; provided, however, that
the parties shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or
incur any obligation in favor of) any person from whom any such Consent or
waiver may be required (other than nominal filing or application fees), (d) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of any of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay, order or injunction entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity preventing consummation of any of the
Transactions vacated or reversed and (e) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.
In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Company and the
Company Board shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
any Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement and (B) if
any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable
to any Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, take

all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
the Merger and the other Transactions and (ii) Parent, on behalf of itself and
its subsidiaries and affiliates, is hereby deemed to have granted any consent
with respect to, and waived compliance with any requirements of, any term or
provision of any Contract or arrangement in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, between and among Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, on
the one hand, and the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or affiliates, on the
other hand, to the extent necessary in order to consummate the Transactions
without resulting in a breach, default or other violation of any such Contract
or arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its
Representatives shall not be prohibited under this Section 7.03 from taking any
action permitted by Section 6.02.

                  SECTION 7.04. Stock Options. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement (or, in the case of any Company
Stock Plan adopted after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of such Plan's
adoption), the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering
the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as may be required in order that each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether
vested or unvested, shall be canceled upon the occurrence of the Effective Time,
and that the holder of such Company Stock Option shall become entitled, within
five business days following the Effective Time, to receive (i) a cash payment
from Parent, in an amount equal to the product of (A) the excess of the Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Stock
Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised (the "Option
Shares") and (ii) a number of shares of Newco Common Stock from the Company
equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B) the number of
Option Shares. To the extent that the foregoing provisions would otherwise
require the Company to provide to the holder of a Company Stock Option a
fractional share of

<PAGE>

                                                                              55

Newco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will instead pay cash in lieu of such
fractional share based on the value of a share of Newco Common Stock determined
in accordance with Section 2.02(e). All payments and distributions pursuant to
this Section shall be subject to all appropriate withholding.

                  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt
resolutions terminating the Company Stock Plans, and deleting provisions in any
other Company Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any
capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of
the Company, as of the Effective Time.

                  (c) In this Agreement:

                  "Company Stock Option" means any option to purchase Company
         Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan.

                  "Company Stock Plans" means the Company's 2001 Broad Based
         Option Plan, the Company's 1994 Stock Option Plan, the Company's 1994

         Option Plan and any plans permitting the grant of options to purchase
         Company Common Stock that are adopted by the Company or any Company
         Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
         Time in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case as
         amended through the date of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 7.05. Certain Claims. (a) Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any affiliate of Parent or encourage any other person to, either
before or after the Effective Time, assert any rights or pursue any actions or
claims, whether directly or on a derivative basis, against (i) the Company or
any of its affiliates or Newco or any affiliate of Newco or (ii) any of the
current or former directors, officers, members of the board of managers,
members, managers, employees, consultants, advisors, attorneys, trustees or
agents of the Company or any of its affiliates or Newco or any affiliate of
Newco (in each case, solely in their capacities as such), in each case for acts
or omissions occurring (A) prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) after the
date of this Agreement and prior

                                                                              56

to the Effective Time, whether known or unknown, and Parent shall not, and
Parent shall not permit any affiliate of Parent to, cooperate with any person in
the assertion of any such rights or pursuing any such actions or claims except
(x) as required by subpoena or other judicial or legal process or (y) as
required by any inquiry by a Governmental Entity, but in each case only to the
extent such inquiry or requirement to cooperate has not arisen as a result of a
breach of this Section 7.05(a); provided, however, that this Section 7.05(a)
shall not (1) affect any person's right to enforce any Transaction Agreement,
any Commercial Agreement, any I/R Agreement (as defined in the Restructuring
Agreement), any Newco I/R Agreement (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement),
any agreement entered into between the Company, Newco or any of their respective
affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the R Parties or any of their respective
affiliates, on the other hand, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time or any provision herein or therein in accordance with its terms,
(2) apply to any act or omission which constitutes fraud in the inducement with
respect to any Transaction Agreement or any Commercial Agreement or (3) apply to
any action permitted or required by the Ongoing Litigation Agreement; provided
further, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated, this Section

doubt, the parties expressly agree that in no event will a fee be paid pursuant
to this Section 7.06(b) unless and until the transactions contemplated by a
Company Takeover Proposal (including a Company Takeover Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Company Proposal) are consummated (and the payment of
such fee shall otherwise be subject to the other provisions of this Section
7.06(b)). Any fee due under this Section 7.06(b) shall be paid by wire transfer

reimbursement shall not exceed $5,000,000. All payments made pursuant to this

Acquisition Date (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) occurs under the
Company Rights Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall make such
adjustment to the Merger Consideration as the Company and Parent shall mutually

                                                                              69

7.02, Section 7.06, 7.07, 7.12, this Section 9.02 and Article X, which
provisions shall survive such termination, and except for any liability that
results from the material breach by a party of any representation, warranty or
covenant set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, as a result of the termination of this Agreement,
neither Parent (on behalf of R Diagnostics) nor the Company shall be deemed to
have (a) made a settlement with respect to, waived, given-up, compromised,
prejudiced or qualified in any manner (i) its right to fully prosecute the New
Patent Litigation, (ii) any of its rights or interests which are the subject of
the New Patent Litigation or (iii) any claim made or to be made by either Parent
or the Company, whether for damages or otherwise, in the New Patent Litigation
or (b) made a settlement with respect to, waived, given up, compromised,
prejudiced or qualified in any manner any of its rights or interests under the
Final Judgment (as modified by the Court of Appeals Opinion) or any final
judgment entered by the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland consistent with the mandate to be returned by the United States Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in connection with the Court of Appeals
Opinion. Each of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Letter Agreement shall
survive termination of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;
provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by applicable Law

<PAGE>

                                                                              70

requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
Newco may, in its sole discretion and with, if necessary, approval of its Board
of Directors, unilaterally change the Exchange Ratio to equal the product of (a)
a number determined by Newco and (b) such ratio prior to such change.

                  SECTION 9.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the
proviso of Section 9.03, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                  SECTION 9.05. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension
or Waiver. (a) A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, an
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.03 or an extension or waiver
pursuant to Section 9.04 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of
Parent, Sub, the Company or Newco, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee of its Board of Directors.

                  (b) The Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(d) only if (i) the Company Board has received a Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal, (iii) the
Company has notified Parent in writing of the determination described in Section
9.05(b)(ii), the identity of the person making the Superior Company Proposal and
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Company Proposal; (iv) at
least three business days

following receipt by Parent of the notice referred to in Section 9.05(b)(iii),
and, taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent since receipt of
the notice referred to in Section 9.05(b)(iii), such Superior Company Proposal
remains a Superior Company Proposal and the Company Board has again made the
determinations referred to in Section 9.05(b)(ii) (although no additional time
period shall be required following such determinations, but it being understood
that any amendment to the price or any other material terms of such a Superior
Company Proposal shall require an additional notice and a new three business day
period), (v) the Company is in compliance with Section 6.02 and (vi) the Company
Board concurrently approves and recommends, and the Company concurrently enters
into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior
Company Proposal.

or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void;
provided, however, the parties acknowledge and agree that the conversion of

assigns.

parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any Delaware state court or any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the
parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any
Delaware state court or any Federal court of the United States sitting in the
State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
Transaction, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court,
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any
Transaction in any court other than in any Delaware state court or any Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware and (iv)
waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction.

process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any Transaction that may be instituted in any
court described in Section 10.10(a). Parent agrees to take any and all

               THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
               UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
               OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND,
               ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED

               SUCH ACT OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS


                                  DEMAND NOTE



                                             Dated:__________________, 200__


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, IGEN INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Delaware
corporation, (the "Borrower"), hereby promises to pay to the order of ROCHE
HOLDING LTD, a joint stock company organized under the laws of Switzerland (the
"Lender"), on demand after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below)), the principal sum of US$_____________
(______________ United States Dollars) (such principal sum, together with any
accrued interest added to the principal hereof as hereinafter provided being
referred to herein as the "Principal Amount"), and to pay interest (computed on
the basis of 360-day years of twelve 30-day months) on the unpaid Principal
Amount hereof from the date hereof at the rate of ______% per annum, payable
semi-annually on December 1 and June 1 in each year (each such date, an
"Interest Payment Date"), commencing on _____________, 200_, until the Principal
Amount is paid in full and to pay on demand interest (so computed) on any
overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on any overdue
interest, from the due date thereof at a rate per annum equal to ______% until
the obligation with respect to the payment thereof shall be discharged. The
Borrower shall pay all amounts due hereunder on _______________ (the "Maturity
Date") to the extent that such amount was not paid prior to the Maturity Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Demand Note, the Lender shall
not make any demand for payment hereunder until after the Effective Time.

     Payments of principal and interest shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America at the principal office of the Lender; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall have the option, in lieu of paying accrued
interest in cash





                                   A-1
<PAGE>

on any Interest Payment Date, to satisfy its obligation to pay such accrued
interest by adding the amount of such accrued interest to the principal hereof
on such Interest Payment Date. Any amount so added to the principal hereof shall
thereafter accrue interest at the applicable per annum rate set forth above
until paid in full.

     The parties hereto agree that (i) no loan hereunder shall be made until
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of July 21, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement") among the Lender, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lender, the Borrower and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Borrower), (ii) no obligation to repay such loan shall arise
until such loan is actually made and (iii) no interest shall accrue hereunder
until such loan is actually made.

     The Borrower agrees that this Demand Note is and shall remain an
unsubordinated obligation of the Borrower that ranks pari passu with all other
senior unsecured indebtedness of the Borrower.

     The Borrower agrees that the account of the Lender shall be prima facie
evidence of the amounts loaned by the Lender to the undersigned and the amounts
repaid by the undersigned to the Lender. The date and amount of the initial
Principal Amount, the date and amount of each addition to the Principal Amount,
and the date and amount of each prepayment of the Principal Amount, may be
endorsed by the Lender on the schedule attached hereto which is part of this
Demand Note. The obligations of the Borrower under this Demand Note shall be
absolute and the Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any right (whether arising
by operation of law or otherwise) to any setoff, counterclaim or reduction of
its obligations with respect to any amounts payable under this Demand Note based
on any claims that the Borrower has against the Lender, its affiliates or any
other person.

     Any outstanding amounts hereunder may be paid in full or in part without
prior notice at any time.

     The Borrower hereby waives presentment for payment, demands, notice of
dishonor and protest of this Demand Note and further agrees that none of its
terms or provisions may be waived, altered, modified or amended except as the
Lender may consent in a writing duly signed for and on its behalf. No failure or
delay on the part of the Lender in exercising any of its rights, powers or
privileges hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right,
power or privilege. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.





                                   A-2

     This Demand Note is binding upon the Borrower and its successors and
assigns and is for the benefit of the Lender and its successors and assigns,
except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations under this Demand Note.

     THIS DEMAND NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.
