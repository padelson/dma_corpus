of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any

assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Section 1.6 Stockholders Meeting.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days), the Company shall prepare and file
as promptly as practicable with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") a proxy for a special meeting of the Companys stockholders (the "
_Special Meeting_ ") (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto and any other required proxy materials, the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
relating to the Merger and this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the
Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with the intention that the
Proxy Statement be in a form ready to print and mail to the stockholders of
the Company as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement.
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all

obtain and furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the
Proxy Statement and, after consultation with Merger Sub, respond promptly to
any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement  



 

\- 3 -  promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given

shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company shall
not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to the
Companys stockholders unless it has first obtained the consent of Parent and
Merger Sub to such mailing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by applicable Law, and the Company further agrees to cause the Proxy
Statement, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and, if
any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement as
provided in Section 1.6(b)(ii), mailed to holders of shares (the " _Shares_ ")
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common
Stock_ "), in each case as and to the extent required by the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ") or the SEC (or its staff).

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law:

record date for, call and give notice of the Special Meeting for the purpose
of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (with the record date and
meeting date set in consultation with Merger Sub, with the meeting date being
no later than thirty (30) Business Days following the earliest of the date on
which the SEC staff advises the Company that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement (or that the SEC staff advises that it is not reviewing the
Proxy Statement) or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy
Statement); and (B) as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, convene and hold the Special Meeting;

(ii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders;
and

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any party hereto or of the holders of any securities of the Company or
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger
Sub Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



 

\- 4 - (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $15.65 per
share, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ " and
collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry share (each, a " _Book-
Entry Share_ " and collectively, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing any
such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest thereon.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate a
bank or trust company to act as the payment agent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which Paying Agent shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with
such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in an amount equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration (such funds, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Such funds shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole
discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make all such payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to make such payments. The
Paying Agent shall make payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.



 

\- 5 - (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, and
whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Such letter and instructions can be
faxed to the holder of record upon request. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Such payment shall be made to the holder of record by bank check;
_provided_ , that any holder of record entitled to a payment in excess of
$500,000 shall have the right to receive payment by electronic wire transfer,
in which case payment shall be made net of any applicable wire transfer fees.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that: (x) the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer; and (y) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the  



 

\- 6 -  Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered
prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
held by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to (i) direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, (ii) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies,
or (iii) money market funds invested solely in any of the foregoing, or a
combination thereof; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the value of the
cash held by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2 is reduced below
the amount necessary to pay any unpaid Merger Consideration, Parent shall
immediately deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent sufficient to
correct this deficiency. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the property of Parent and paid to Parent upon demand.



 

\- 7 - Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead the holder of
such Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of the
Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Merger Sub of any demands
received by the Company for dissenters rights of any Shares, and Merger
Sub shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Merger Sub, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 Treatment of Company Options.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Common Stock
granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed and converted automatically at the
Effective Time into an option to acquire shares of Parent Stock, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Option (including vesting schedule) except that (i) the number of
shares of Parent Stock subject to each such option or right shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the
" _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of
Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the five consecutive trading
days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Company Option an
appropriate notice setting forth the terms of such assumption and conversion.
With respect to any Company Option that is an "incentive stock option" (within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the parties hereto intend that such assumption and conversion shall, to
the extent reasonably practicable, conform to the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code.



 

\- 8 - (b) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Options pursuant to this Section 2.4, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4. Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares
of Parent Stock subject to the assumed Company Options as soon as practicable
and in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the
Effective Time.

violation by any other Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.2(a), at any time
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the
Company may (subject to the proviso at the end of this sentence), in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal received after the
date hereof that the Company Board of Directors has determined, in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel and independent financial
advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal: (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person or group making such Alternative Proposal and their
Representatives and potential debt and equity financing sources pursuant to a

and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such person or group

(c) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
except and to the extent expressly permitted under this Section 5.2(c),

withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation; (ii) approve, recommend or  



 

\- 35 -  cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement or similar
agreement constituting or relating to, or that is intended to be or would
reasonably be likely to result in, any Alternative Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in compliance with Section 5.2(b)); (iii) adopt,
approve, endorse, recommend, or propose to adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend, any Alternative Proposal; or (iv) resolve to propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board of
Directors may withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation (a "
_Change of Company Recommendation_ ") if, (x) prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith that (A) in the absence of any breach of the
Companys obligations under this Section 5.2 an unsolicited bona fide written
Alternative Proposal received by the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal
or (B) other than in response to an Alternative Proposal and following
consultation with outside counsel that the exercise of its fiduciary duties
require such change to be made, and (y) (A) after the third (3rd) Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice (an " _Adverse Recommendation
Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors desires to
effect a Change of Company Recommendation (including the reasons for such
change and the date on which the Board proposes to take such action), (B) in
the case of an Adverse Recommendation Notice resulting from the existence of
a Superior Proposal, the Company has complied with the requirements of
Section 5.2(e) (including, without limitation, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making
such Superior Proposal), (C) the Company provides Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to make adjustments or revisions in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that the Company Board of Directors considers in good faith
during such three (3) Business Day period, and (D) following the end of such
three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after taking into account any and all proposed amendments or
revisions made by Parent, and after consulting with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that either (1) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Notice resulting from the existence of a Superior Proposal, the
Alternative Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or, (2) alternatively, the
exercise of its fiduciary duties requires such action. In the event of any
material revisions to any Alternative Proposal (including, without limitation,
any increase in price), the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Adverse Recommendation Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.2(c) with respect to such new notice (including beginning a new
three (3) Business Day period). Nothing in this Section 5.2(c) shall be
deemed to permit the Company to take any action described in clauses (ii) or
(iii) of the first sentence of this Section 5.2(c) or resolve to propose or
agree to do any such action unless it has terminated this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(a)(iii) and paid to Parent the fees specified in Section
8.2(b).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from: (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
pending disclosure of its position thereunder; or (ii) making any disclosure
to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Company Board of Directors to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. 



 

\- 36 - (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of: (i) any Alternative Proposal or any
inquiries, proposals or offers reasonably expected to lead to an Alternative
Proposal; (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with or reasonably expected to be related to an
Alternative Proposal; and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or
negotiation that would reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative
Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such
Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry, offer or request and the material
terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry or
offer. The Company shall (i) keep Parent promptly informed of any
such discussions or negotiations regarding any such Alternative Proposal,
indication, inquiry or offer or any material developments relating thereto or
material changes to the terms thereof, (ii) provide to Parent promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of any
such Alternative Proposal or any amendments thereto that are in writing or a
written summary of any such oral Alternative Proposal or amendment thereto,
all correspondence transmitting any such Alternative Proposal or any
amendment thereto, or written materials describing the terms or conditions of
any financing relating to such Alternative Proposal. The Company shall provide
or make available to Parent (subject to the Confidentiality Agreement) any
non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not
previously provided to Parent contemporaneously with providing any such
information to any person making an Alternative Proposal or its
Representatives.

Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Alternative Proposal. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have all copies of all non-public information it or
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have distributed on or

or settlement of any such litigation and shall consider Parents views with
respect to such litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without

required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or

at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is

Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue

exempt thereunder. Provided that the Company shall first provide to Parent the
names of its stockholders and the number of shares of Common Stock or Company
Options which may be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and any
other information reasonably requested by Parent and relating to the same, the
Board of Directors of Parent, or an authorized committee thereof, shall,
prior to the Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve, for purposes

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Benefit Plans and
compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit the amendment or termination of any such Benefit
Plans, Foreign Plans, arrangements and agreements in  



 

\- 43 -  accordance with their terms and applicable Law. For a period of 12 months
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("
_Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits that are no less favorable,
in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent also shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to perform the Companys obligations under any
change in control and other agreements between the Company and certain of its
officers and employees unless any such officer or employee agrees otherwise.

(b) Company Employees shall continue to participate in the Benefit Plans or
Foreign Plans following the Effective Time unless and until Parent chooses to
have some or all of the Company Employees participate in one or more New
Plans. If and to the extent Company Employees are permitted to become
participants in one or more New Plans, then for purposes of vesting, waiting
period, eligibility to participate, and level of benefits under such New
Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of time. To the extent permitted under the applicable New
Plan, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and, to the extent permitted by the applicable New
Plan or otherwise practicable without adverse tax consequences, Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation
of the Merger ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins, and overlapping with the portion of the
current plan year of such New Plan which has elapsed prior to such
participation date, to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that at the Effective Time a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) shall occur within the meaning of the Company
Stock Plans (and award agreements thereunder) and the Benefit Plans and the
Foreign Plans, as applicable, including without limitation the employee change
of control agreements.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries will, at the request of Parent prior to
the Closing Date, take all action necessary to terminate any Benefit
Plan subject to Section 401(k) of Code prior to the Closing on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.



 

\- 44 - (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Surviving Corporation, and their
Affiliates shall not be prohibited by this Section 6.9 from treating the
employees as at-will employees (subject to any contrary employment agreements
or applicable Law), or terminating or transferring or changing the terms of
the employment of any employee, or adopting, amending, or terminating any
benefit plan or other compensatory arrangement. No provision of this Section
6.9 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or any
current or former director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any
other matter.

Section 6.10 Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements.

During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries is a party, other than client and customer agreements entered
into by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. During such period, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by using
reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any
court having jurisdiction. The Company shall inform Parent of any actual or,
to the Companys Knowledge, threatened breaches of any such agreement and of
any request by any Person to terminate, amend, modify or waive the provisions
of any such agreement, and of the identity of any such Person.
