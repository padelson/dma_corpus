upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, and, in furtherance thereof,
have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

 



 

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (i) all of the issued and

D. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

 



 

E. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material

F. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, and in any case no later than 11:59 a.m. Pacific Time on the
date of this Agreement, and as a material inducement to Parent and Merger Sub
to enter into this Agreement, the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent

Agreement, each of the Key Employees has agreed to enter into an offer letter

H. As a material inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Paul Kocher and Benjamin Jun have agreed to enter into a non-
competition agreement with Parent limiting certain activities in the field of
the Company Business, in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit B** (the "
**Non-Competition Agreement** "), to be effective as of the Closing.

      
 

 



 

I. The Company intends to distribute to its employees, consultants, and

(a) **_Effect on Capital Stock_**. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or any
Shareholder, each share of Company Common Stock (excluding, for avoidance of
doubt, Company Options, which shall be treated as provided in **Section
1.6(b) **below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this **Section
1.6** and throughout this Agreement, including but not limited to the escrow
provisions set forth in **Article VII **and the Escrow Agreement, will be
cancelled and extinguished and will be converted automatically into the right
to receive from Parent upon surrender of the certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in **Section 1.8**, (i)
the shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Stock Exchange Ratio _plus_
(ii) a cash payment equal to the Closing Cash Consideration Per Share _plus_
(iii) the Escrow Payment per Share, if any, _plus_ (iv) the Shareholder
Representative Fund Payment per Share, if any ((i) through (iv) collectively,
the " **Consideration Per Share** "). For purposes of calculating the amount
issuable to each Shareholder pursuant to this **Section 1.6(a)**, all shares
of Company Common Stock held by each Shareholder shall be aggregated on a
certificate by certificate basis.

 



 

(b) **_Treatment of Company Options_**.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested,
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, terminate in its entirety and Parent shall substitute for each
such Company Option the right to receive, (A) a cash payment equal to the
product of (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock as to which
such Company Option was vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (2) the excess of the Closing Cash Consideration Per Share
_minus_ the Option Exercise Amount of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " **Option Cash-Out Amount**"), as more particularly
set forth on the Spreadsheet, plus (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Stock Exchange Ratio, plus (C) the Escrow Payment per
Share, if any, plus (D) the Shareholder Representative Fund Payment per Share,
if any ((A) through (D) collectively, the " **Consideration Per Option** "). A
portion of each Company Option holders Option Cash-Out Amount equal to such
holders pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount shall be immediately deposited
by Parent into the Escrow Fund pursuant to **Section 7.5 **hereof and that
portion of each Company Option holders Option Cash-Out Amount equals the
Shareholder Representative Fund Payment per Share shall be immediately
deposited in the Shareholder Representative Fund; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the value of the Consideration Per Option does not exceed the Option
Exercise Amount of such Company Option, the Consideration Per

 



      
 

 



 

Option with respect to such Company Option shall be $0; _provided_ , _further_
, if the Closing Cash Consideration Per Share is less than the Option Exercise
Amount plus the cash portion of the Escrow Payment Per Share, the amounts will
be equitably adjusted with respect to such Shares. The payment of the Option
Cash-Out Amount will be subject to withholdings for all applicable Taxes. For
the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option that is exercised contingent upon
the Closing shall not be subject to this **Section 1.6(b), **but shall
instead be deemed exercised prior to the Effective Time and the shares of
Company Common Stock received upon such exercise shall be governed by
**Section 1.6(a)**. Prior to the Closing, the Company will take all necessary
action to accelerate all outstanding Company Options such that they are fully
vested and exercisable immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing.

 



 

(ii) The aggregate Option Cash-Out Amount and the shares of Parent Common
Stock distributable to the former holders of Company Options pursuant to
Section 1.6(b)(i) above shall be paid (or delivered, in the case of the Parent
Common Stock) by Parent to the Company and distributed by the Company as soon
as is reasonably practicable to the former holders of Company Options
outstanding as of the Effective Time and, with respect to the Option Cash-Out
Amounts, in accordance with the Companys normal payroll procedures, at not
later than the date of the first normal payroll following the Closing.

 



 

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the review and reasonable
approval of Parent, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary and
obtained all necessary consents to effect the transactions anticipated by this
**Section 1.6(b) **under all agreements relating to Company Options and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or
informal).

 



 

(c) **_Withholding Taxes_**. The Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any person such amounts as are required by law to be deducted or withheld
therefrom, and shall pay such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(d) **_Capital Stock of Merger Sub_**. Each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) **_Securities Law Compliance; Certificate Legends_**. The shares of Parent
Common Stock representing the Merger Share Amount will be issued in a
transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act by reason of
Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act
and may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other applicable
rules and regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The certificates
or other instruments representing the shares of Parent Common Stock, until
such time as the sale of such shares have been registered under the Securities
Act, or as otherwise provided below, shall bear a restrictive legend in
substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed
against transfer of such stock certificates in contravention of such legend):

 



 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR
SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN

 



      
 

 



 

EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SAID
ACT.

 



 

The legend set forth above shall be removed and Parent shall promptly issue a
certificate without such legend to the holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock upon which it is stamped, if, unless otherwise required by state
securities laws, (i) such shares are registered for sale under the Securities
Act, (ii) in connection with a sale, assignment or other transfer, such holder
provides Parent with an opinion of counsel, in a reasonably acceptable form to
Parent, to the effect that such sale, assignment or transfer of the shares may
be made without registration under the Securities Act, or (iii) such holder
provides Parent with reasonable and customary assurance that the shares can be
sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as
to the number of securities that can be immediately sold.

 



 

(f) **_Fractional Shares_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued,
but in lieu thereof, each Shareholder and Optionholder, as applicable, who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received
by such Shareholder or Optionholder, as applicable) shall be entitled to
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Trading
Price.

 



 

(g) **_Adjustments_**. The Consideration Per Share and Consideration Per
Option shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), or
other distribution (other than the Company Distributions) in respect of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
(other than the Company Distributions) occurring after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 ** _1.7 Dissenting Shares_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders dissenters rights in accordance with Chapter
13 of California Law (any such shares being referred to as the " **Dissenting
Shares** " until such time as the holder thereof fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses such holders dissenters rights under California law)
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Consideration
Per Share for Company Common Stock set forth in **Section 1.6(a)**, but the
holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by
California Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of **Section 1.7(a)**, **** if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters rights under California Law
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the consideration for such shares
of Company Common Stock, as applicable, set forth in **Section 1.6(a)**,
without interest thereon, and subject to the provisions of **Article VII**,
upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
dissenters rights of Company Common Stock received by the Company pursuant to
the applicable provisions of California Law and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle
or settle any such demands. To the extent that Parent or the Surviving

Dissenting Shares in excess of the amount that otherwise would have been
payable or issuable in respect of such shares under **Section 1.6(a) **of
this Agreement or (B) incurs any other reasonable costs or expenses in respect
of such Dissenting Shares (together, " **Dissenting Share Payments** "),

or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and
(B) any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with in any material respect
or any condition to be satisfied by it hereunder.

 



 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, (i) Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company of (A) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence

any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (B) any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with in any material respect or any condition to be

which Parent suspects would cause any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (B) any failure of the Company
to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with in any
material respect or any condition to be satisfied by it hereunder.

 



 

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this **Section 5.3** shall not (i)

right to indemnification provided herein.

 



 

 ** _5.5 Public Disclosure_**. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
neither it nor any officer, director, employee, independent contractor or
representative of the Company shall issue any statement or

 



      
 

 



 

communication to the public or the press regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company is required under law to make

an opportunity to review and comment on both the legal requirement to make
such statement or communication and the content thereof. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that Parent, without the prior written consent of the
Company, may make public statements and disclosure regarding this Agreement

respect to all Unpaid Third Party Expenses set forth on the Statement of
Expenses, and (ii) pay in full all Unpaid Third Party Expenses on or prior to
the Closing. Any Unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company that are
not reflected as a Liability on the Statement of Expenses or not otherwise
reflected on the Company Closing Balance Sheet shall be subject to the

 ** _5.7 Lease Term._** Until October 31, 2012, Parent intends to continue to
retain the operations of the Company at its current main office location.

 



 

 ** _5.8 Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) **_Termination of Plans_** ** _._** Unless otherwise directed in writing
by Parent at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
agrees to terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs, or arrangements that are covered under ERISA, as
of 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) **_New Employment Arrangements_** ** _._**

 



 

(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one of their respective Subsidiaries
may offer "at-will" employment to certain employees of the Company. Such "at-
will" employment arrangements will supersede any prior employment agreements
and other arrangements with such employee in effect prior to the Closing Date.
Each of the Continuing Employees shall enter into the Parents standard
agreement regarding confidential and proprietary information and Parents
standard form of offer letter subject to the Closing (with such modifications
as determined by Parent). The provisions of this **Section 5.8(b) **shall not
apply to the employment of the Key Employees, whose terms and conditions of
employment shall be governed separately by the Offer Letters.

 



 

(ii) Each Key Employee shall sign an Offer Letter in connection with the
Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) **_Retention Bonus Pool_**.

 



 

(i) At the next payment day under the normal payroll cycle of Parent after
each Retention Milestone occurring no earlier than ten Business Days after
such Retention Milestone, Parent shall pay: (i) to the Eligible Employees or
Contractors, if any, an aggregate amount equal to the portion of the Retention
Bonus Pool for such Retention Milestone that is then payable to the Eligible
Employees or Contractors as Retention Bonuses, as set forth on the Retention
Bonus Spreadsheet, with such amounts being paid in accordance with the normal
payroll procedures of Parent (or to contractors in the normal payment
procedures of Parent), less withholding amounts pursuant to applicable law and
regulation and subject to structuring of such payment to avoid taxation under
Section 409A, and (ii) to one or more charitable entities under the Code as
may then be mutually agreed between Parent and Paul Kocher, an aggregate
amount equal to the remainder of the Retention Bonus Pool for such Retention
Milestone that remains unpaid after such Retention Milestone; _provided_ ,
that if Parent and Paul Kocher are unable to agree on which charitable
entities will receive such funds or the allocation of the funds among such
entities then all such funds shall be donated to the American Red Cross.

 



 

(ii) For those Eligible Employees or Contractors (1) who are terminated by
Parent without Cause, (2) who are terminated due to a Termination for Death or
Disability or (3) who resign following an involuntary order to relocate the
geographic location at which such Eligible Employee or Contractor performs
services to a location outside of the city of San Francisco, California
(excluding ordinary business travel and short term assignments of not more
than 30 consecutive days and not more than 90 days total annually) (a "
**Relocation** "), Parent will pay any unpaid Retention Bonus Amounts in
accordance with the Retention Bonus Spreadsheet through the normal payroll
procedures of Parent (or to contractors in the normal payment procedures of
Parent), less withholding amounts pursuant to applicable law and regulation
and subject to structuring of such payment to avoid taxation under Section
409A, within 53 days of such termination or resignation and subject to the
effectiveness of a customary release agreement in favor of Parent executed by
such Eligible Employee or Contractor or his or her authorized representative.

 



 

(iii) To the extent that Parent elects to issue Parent Common Stock as part of
the Retention Bonuses, Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to file with the SEC (at its sole expense and, if filed on Form S-8,
prior to the date of such Retention Milestone at which such Parent Common
Stock will be issued) a registration statement on Form S-8 for the issuance
and resale of such shares of Parent Common Stock or, if Form S-8 is
unavailable for any reason for such Retention Bonuses, Form S-3 for the resale
of such shares of Parent Common Stock or any other applicable registration
statement that would permit secondary sales of such shares of Parent Common
Stock.

 



 

 ** _5.9 Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) **_Subchapter S Status_**. None of the Company or any Shareholder will
take or will omit to take any action, which action or omission would
reasonably be expected to result in the loss by the Company of its status as
an S corporation within the meaning of Section 1361(a) of the Code (or any
comparable state law). Each of the Shareholders jointly and severally
indemnifies and holds Parent and the Company harmless against any Losses,
including the incurrence of any Tax or the loss of any Tax benefit that would
have been generated, utilized or recognized in any taxable period ending after
the Closing Date as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, resulting
from the failure of the Company to qualify as an S corporation within the
meaning of the Code (or any comparable state law).

 



 

(b) **_Section 338(h)(10) Election_**.

 



 

(i) The Merger is intended to constitute a "qualified stock purchase" within
the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code. The Shareholders and Parent
shall make a timely, irrevocable and

 



      
 

 



 

effective election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar
election under any applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law
(collectively, the " **Section 338(h)(10) Elections**") with respect to
Parents purchase of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

(ii) To facilitate the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, Parent shall deliver to
each Shareholder at least 20 days prior to Closing, copies of IRS Form 8023
and any similar forms under applicable state, local and foreign income Tax law
(collectively, the " **Tax Elections** ") properly completed to the extent
pertaining to Parent and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Tax Elections shall be properly completed by the Shareholders to the extent
pertaining to the Shareholders and duly executed by each Shareholder and an
authorized person for Parent prior to the Closing. Parent shall duly and
timely file the Tax Elections as prescribed by Treasury Regulations Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding provisions of applicable state, local or
foreign income Tax law.

 



 

(iii) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in no event more than
45 days after the Closing Date, Shareholder Representative shall provide for
Parents review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) a draft of IRS
Form 8883, including the calculation and proposed allocation of the Aggregate
Deemed Sales Price in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 338
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and the methodology set
forth in **Schedule 5.9(b)(iii)**. Each of Parent, the Company and the
Shareholders shall prepare and file all Returns consistent with, and shall not
take any Tax position inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or
such allocation.

 



 

(iv) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or the Alternative
Transaction, Parent, the Shareholder Representative and their respective tax
advisors shall, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and
in any event at least five Business Days prior to Closing) agree on the amount
of the California Minimum Tax. For purposes of such determination, any
deductions or credits attributable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (e.g., any bonuses, cash-out of options or other compensatory
payments, including any compensatory portion of the Company Distributions)
shall be applied to reduce the California Minimum Tax liability to the maximum
extent allowable under applicable law.

 



 

(c) **_Responsibility for Taxes and Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods._**

 



 

(i) The Shareholder Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
shall file or cause to be filed, all Returns for the Company required to be
filed on or prior to the Closing Date and all income Tax Returns for the
Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, whether
required to be filed prior to, on or after the Closing Date, including any
amendments to any such income Tax Returns. Such Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with applicable law as determined in good faith by the Shareholder
Representative and consistent with past practice. The Shareholder
Representative shall provide such Returns to Parent for review within a
reasonable period prior to filing such Return. Except as set forth in this
**Section 5.9(c)**, Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all Returns for the Company required to be filed after the Closing
Date. Upon request of the Shareholder Representative, Parent shall provide any
such Return which relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the Shareholder
Representative for review within a reasonable period prior to the due date for
filing such Return, and will consider in good faith any changes to such
Returns reasonably proposed by the Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), Parent shall not amend (or cause or permit to
be amended) Return of (or which includes) the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Company shall be entitled to
claim on its income Tax Returns which include the Closing Date all
compensation deductions arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any such deductions with respect to
the payment of any bonuses to employees and the Option Cash-Out Amount) and,
except as otherwise required pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code), neither the Company nor Parent shall take any
position inconsistent with such treatment

 



 

(iv) The Shareholders shall be solely responsible for and shall timely pay any
Taxes imposed under applicable Law on the Shareholders for any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that any failure to pay
such Taxes could result in any liability to the Company or Parent.

 



 

(v) The Company shall be responsible for payment of the California Minimum Tax
following the Closing. The parties have agreed that Parent shall be
responsible for funding the payment of 50% of the California Minimum Tax by
the Company and the Shareholders shall be responsible for funding the payment
of the other 50% of the California Minimum Tax by the Company (with such funds
being provided by the Shareholders by means of a reduction in the Purchase
Price, as contemplated in the definition of Net Working Capital). In the event
that, after the Closing Date, the California Minimum Tax is increased to an
amount in excess of the amount determined under **Section 5.9(b)(iv)**, then
50% of any such increase shall be deemed to constitute Pre-Closing Taxes (and,
notwithstanding anything in **Section 7.2** to the contrary, 50% of any
Losses resulting from such increase shall be subject to indemnification
pursuant to **Section 7.2**), and in the event the California Minimum Tax is
decreased to an amount below the amount determined under **Section
5.9(b)(iv)**, then 50% of any such decrease shall be deemed to constitute a
refund of Taxes that is subject to **Section 5.9(e)**.

 



 

(d) The Shareholder Representative and Parent shall control any audits,
disputes, administrative, judicial or other proceedings related to Tax periods
covered by the Tax Returns for which the Shareholder Representative or the
Parent, as the case may be, has filing responsibility pursuant to **Section
5.9(c)(i), **other than any proceeding related to the validity and
effectiveness of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, which shall be controlled
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the controlling party shall allow the
other to participate in any such proceeding; _provided,_ _further_ , that the
controlling party shall not enter into any settlement of any contest or
otherwise compromise any material issue with respect to such proceeding that
could have a material impact on the other (under this Agreement or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(e) The Shareholders shall be entitled to all refunds and overpayments (and
any interest thereon received from the applicable Governmental Entity) in
respect of Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except to the extent
any such refund or overpayment was taken into account in determining the
Company Closing Net Working Capital. For purposes of this **Section 5.9(e)**,
in the event that any actual Liability of the Company for Taxes with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than the California Minimum Tax, except
as provided in the last sentence of **Section 5.9(c)(v)**) is less than the
amount of such Liability for Taxes taken into account in Company Closing Net
Working Capital, then such difference shall be treated as a refund of such
Taxes. If Parent, the Company, or any of their affiliates receives or
otherwise becomes entitled to a refund or overpayment to which the
Shareholders are entitled pursuant to this **Section 5.9(e)**, Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid to the Shareholder Representative the amount to which
the Shareholders are entitled within 15 days after such refund is received
(whether actually or as a credit or other offset to Taxes payable). Parent
shall use

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to claim or cause the Company to claim any refunds or
overpayments to which the Shareholders are entitled pursuant to this **Section
5.9(e)**.

 



 

(f) **_Cooperation_**. ** __** Parent and the Shareholders shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of any Returns with respect to the Company or its
operations, and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes of or attributable to the Company or its operations. Such cooperation
shall include Parents retention and provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.

 



 

(g) **_Transfer Taxes._** All transfer, sales, use, value added, excise, stock
transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any California Minimum Tax) (" **Transfer Taxes** ")
that become payable in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Shareholders. The
Shareholders shall, at their own expense, file all necessary Returns and other
documentation to report and pay all Transfer Taxes and to obtain any exemption
or refund of any such Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable Law, Parent
shall join in the filing of any Returns and other documentation described in
this **Section 5.9(g)**.

 



 

 ** _5.10 Required Financial Statements and Information_**(a) .

 



 

(a) Until the Closing Date, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than 15 days after the end of each calendar month, prepare
and make available to Parent an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and
statements of operations of the Company for such calendar month. Such
unaudited consolidated financial statements shall be prepared on a cash basis
consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements and shall fairly
present the Companys financial condition and operating results, on a cash
basis, as of and for each such monthly period.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide to KPMG and PWC all of its information and
documents, support and cooperation as may be reasonably required by KPMG to
prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP and by PWC to conduct an
audit of such financial statements.

 



 

(c) Paul Kocher and Christopher Leigh Rodgers shall provide to PWC management
representation letters with respect to the Company in reasonable and customary
form upon and in connection with the audit of annual financial statements and
preparation of the interim quarterly financial statements of the Company. Any
failure of Paul Kocher or Christopher Leigh Rodgers to perform the obligations
contained in this **Section 5.10(c) **shall be considered a breach of a
covenant of this Agreement by the Company for which Parent will be entitled to
indemnification under **Section 7.2** of this Agreement, notwithstanding the
timing of the occurrence of such failure to perform.

 



 

 ** _5.11 S-3 Registration._**

 



 

(a) Parent agrees to file with the SEC (at its sole expense) a registration
statement on Form S-3, or, if Form S-3 is unavailable for any reason, any
other applicable registration statement that would permit secondary sales
(collectively, the " **S-3 Registration Statement** ") registering the resale
by the Shareholders of that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable at Closing on account of
the Aggregate Parent Stock Consideration. Until the S-3 Registration Statement
is filed, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file on a
timely basis all reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act,
together with any

 



      
 

 



 

materials that are required to be filed with such reports under the Exchange
Act, and Parent shall comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to all
such reports, and none of such reports, when filed, shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file the S-3 Registration
Statement as soon as possible following the Closing Date (and in any event no
later than five Business Days following the Closing Date), subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws, including compliance with
disclosure, accountant consent and other applicable requirements of the
Securities Act for the S-3 Registration Statement. Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the S-3 Registration Statement
continuously effective until all shares of Parent Common Stock covered thereby
have been sold or are eligible for sale under Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act without any limitation as to volume. Parent shall notify the
Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative, promptly after it shall
receive notice thereof, of the date and time the S-3 Registration Statement
and each post-effective amendment to such S-3 Registration Statement becomes
effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such S-3
Registration Statement has been filed. In order to be included in an S-3
Registration Statement, each Shareholder shall be required to submit to Parent
a customary selling security holder questionnaire at least three Business Days
prior to the scheduled filing date of such S-3 Registration Statement.

 



 

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Shareholder whose shares of
Parent Common Stock are included in the S-3 Registration Statement, each of
its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling such
Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, from and
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including any reasonable
legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing or defending any such loss, claim, damage or
Liability including the reasonable fees and expenses of their attorneys) to
which such Shareholder, or any such officer, director, partner or controlling
person may become subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise) insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the S-3 Registration Statement or any omission to
state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading, and Parent will reimburse each such Shareholder and each of its
officers, directors and partners and each person controlling such Shareholder,
as the case may be, for any reasonable legal and any other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such
loss, claim, damage or Liability; _provided, however,_ that Parent will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
Liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or omission,
made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
Parent by or on behalf of such Shareholder specifically for use in the
preparation of the S-3 Registration Statement.

 



 

(c) Each Shareholder shall, if such Shareholders shares of Parent Common
Stock are included in the S-3 Registration Statement, severally as to such
Shareholder only and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each of
its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling Parent within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, from and against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which Parent, or any such officer, director,
partner or controlling person may become subject (under the Securities Act or
otherwise) to the extent that (i) such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based
upon, any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the S-3
Registration Statement or any omission to state therein a fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (as such, an " **S-3
Misstatement or Omission** "), and (ii) such S-3 Misstatement or Omission is
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to Parent
in writing by such Shareholder and stated by such Shareholder to be for the
specific purpose of use in such S-3 Registration Statement, and subject to the
foregoing such Shareholder will reimburse Parent and each of its officers,
directors and partners and each person controlling Parent, as the case may be,
for any reasonable legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such loss, claim,
damage or Liability; _provided, however,_ that the several Liability of each
Shareholder under this **Section 5.11(c) **shall be limited to an amount
equal to the net proceeds of the shares sold by such Shareholder under the S-3
Registration Statement, unless such Liability arises out of or is based on
fraud or intentional misconduct by such Shareholder. Each Shareholder shall
furnish in writing to Parent, acknowledging that such information is for the
specific purpose of use in the S-3 Registration Statement, such customary
information regarding such Shareholder, the shares of Parent Common Stock held
by it and the distribution proposed by such Shareholder as Parent may
reasonably request and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the
S-3 Registration Statement.

 



 

(d) Each party entitled to indemnification under this **Section ** **5.11**
(the " **S-3 Indemnified Party** ") shall give notice to the party required to
provide indemnification (the " **S-3 Indemnifying Party** ") promptly after
such S-3 Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which
indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the S-3 Indemnifying Party to assume
the defence of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided
that counsel for the S-3 Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of
such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the S-3 Indemnified Party
(whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the S-3 Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at such partys expense, and provided
further that the failure of any S-3 Indemnified Party to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the S-3 Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent the failure to file such
notice is materially prejudicial to an S-3 Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend such action and provided further, that the S-3 Indemnifying Party shall
not assume the defense for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest
or there are separate and different defenses. No S-3 Indemnifying Party, in
the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of
each S-3 Indemnified Party (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such S-3 Indemnified Party of a release from all Liability in
respect to such claim or litigation. The provisions of this **Section 5.11**
shall govern any indemnification pursuant to this **Section ** **5.11** ,
notwithstanding the provisions of **Article VII** **** or any other
provisions hereof.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this **Section ** **5.11** , if the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of the S-3 Registration
Statement at any time would require Parent to make an Adverse Disclosure, then
Parent may, upon giving written notice of such to the Shareholder
Representative, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use
of, the S-3 Registration Statement, provided that Parent shall not be
permitted to do so more than one time and for no more than 30 days in the
aggregate. In the event that Parent exercises its rights under the preceding
sentence, the Shareholders agree to immediately suspend their use of the S-3
Registration Statement and any prospectus thereunder in connection with any
sale or offer to sell Parent Common Stock. Parent agrees to end its delay of
filing or initial effectiveness or suspension of use of the S-3 Registration
Statement as provided in this **Section 5.11(e) **immediately after the
termination of any requirement to make an Adverse Disclosure giving rise to
such a delay or suspension.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Parent shall promptly notify (i) prior to Closing, the Company, or (ii)
after Closing until such time as Parent is no longer required to maintain the
effectiveness of the S-3 Registration Statement, the Shareholders and the
Shareholder Representative, if in either case it becomes aware of any Adverse
Disclosure. The Company, each Shareholder and the Shareholder Representative
shall keep the fact that Parent has given notice of an Adverse Disclosure or
otherwise suspended the filing or use of the S-3 Registration Statement
pursuant to **Section 5.11(e) **and any non-public information provided by
Parent in connection therewith, confidential, shall not disclose or reveal any
such information to any person or entity and shall not use such information
for securities trading or any other purpose.

 



 

 ** _5.12 Further Assurances_**. Each party hereto, at the request of another
party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other certificates, instruments,
agreements and other documents, and do and perform such other acts and things,
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for purposes of effecting
completely the consummation of Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _5.13 Employee Benefits_**. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (including, without
limitation, the Surviving Corporation) to provide each Continuing Employee
with employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation). Parent and
its Subsidiaries and affiliates (including, without limitation, the Surviving
Corporation) shall treat, and shall cause each benefit plan, program,
practice, policy and arrangement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates (including, without
limitation, the Surviving Corporation) after the Effective Time and in which
any Continuing Employee (or the spouse or any dependent of any Continuing
Employee) participates or becomes eligible to participate (each, a " **Parent
Benefit Plan** ") to treat, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, accrual of and entitlement to benefits (but not for
accrual of benefits under any "defined benefit plan," as defined in Section

thereunder. The Company DandO Tail Policy will provide, with respect to each
Company Indemnified Party, the indemnification rights (including any rights to

6.2(e)(xiii)** ;

 



 

(ii) any breach or inaccuracy of a Fundamental Representation contained in
this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to **Section 6.2(e)(xiii)** ;

 



 

(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement applicable to it contained in this Agreement or any Related

certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the

(it being understood that the Indemnifying Parties may have liability for the
underlying cause of, and the facts, circumstances or occurrences giving rise
or contributing to such change in Parents stock price).

 



 

 ** _7.3 Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other limitations set forth in this **Section 7.3** , the
maximum aggregate amount that an Indemnified Party may recover from an

breaches were not willful breaches), **Section 7.2(a)(vii)** and **Section
7.2(a)(xi)** shall be limited to such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of
the Escrow Fund.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other limitations set forth in this **Section 7.3** , the

**Section 7.2(a)(ii), Section 7.2(a)(iii)** (but solely to the extent such
breaches were willful breaches), **Section 7.2(a)(v), Section 7.2(a)(vi),
Section 7.2(viii), Section 7.2(a)(ix) or Section 7.2(a)(x)** shall be limited

Indemnifying Party to Indemnified Parties).

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Liability of any Indemnifying
Party for any claims or causes of action under applicable law arising out of
fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement, any
Related Agreement or any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, the
maximum liability of any Indemnifying Party pursuant to **Section 7.2(a)(iv)**
who does not have knowledge of the fraud or willful misrepresentation that has
resulted in a Loss hereunder shall be limited to such Indemnifying Partys Pro
Rata Portion of the Purchase Price (less all amounts that have, as of such
time, already been paid by such Indemnifying Party to Indemnified Parties)
applied on a several basis; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, claims based on fraud or willful misrepresentation shall
be subject to the limitation imposed by the applicable statute of limitations
for such claims.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnified Party shall have any right to seek or obtain indemnification under
this Agreement for any Losses to the extent the liability for such Losses has
been taken into account in determining any adjustments pursuant to **Section
1.8(c)**.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing shall prohibit Parent from seeking and obtaining recourse against the
Indemnifying Parties, or any of them, in the event that Parent issues more
than the aggregate Consideration Per Share to which the Indemnifying Parties,
or any of them, are entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as
set forth in this **Section 7.3(f)** , an Indemnified Party may not recover
any Losses under **Section 7.2(a)(i)** or **(ii)** unless and until such
Losses exceed $175,000 in the aggregate (the " **Threshold Amount** "), in
which case Parent shall be entitled to recover the aggregate amount of all
Losses, including the Threshold Amount. The Threshold Amount shall not apply
as a threshold to any claims or payments made with respect to any right to
recover Losses (A) pursuant to fraud or willful misrepresentation by the
Company in connection with this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any
certificates or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (B) pursuant to **Sections 7.2(a)(iii)** through
**7.2(a)(xi)** , inclusive.

or willful misrepresentation in this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (ii)
relate to any Fundamental Representations, (iii) or otherwise as set forth in
**Section 7.3(b)** , claims by an Indemnified Party for Losses pursuant to
this Agreement shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Fund. Other than with
respect to Losses in connection with any fraud or willful misrepresentation in
this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall first seek
recovery for Losses pursuant to this Agreement from the Escrow Fund prior to
seeking recovery from any Indemnifying Party directly.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for any claim
relating to any breach by the Company of its representations and warranties
set forth in **Section 2.15** , the maximum aggregate Losses recoverable by
the Indemnified Party for such breach will be limited to the product of (x)
the maximum aggregate amount of Losses an Indemnified Party could recover from
the Indemnifying Parties collectively pursuant to **Section 7.3(b)** and (y)
the fraction which represents the proportionate value of the Intellectual
Property Rights that were the subject of such breach, relative to the value of
the Company as a whole, in each case, as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(i) The amount of any Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party hereunder
with respect to any breach or nonperformance of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company in this Agreement shall be net of any
insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Parties (net of any costs of
collection, deductible, retroactive premium adjustment, reimbursement
obligation or other cost directly related to the insurance claim in respect of
Losses and subject to rights of subrogation as applicable). The Indemnified
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under the
applicable insurance policies covering any Losses to the same extent as they
would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the
event that an insurance recovery is made by the Indemnified Parties with
respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder,
then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct
collection expenses) shall be made promptly to the Shareholder Representative
for payment to each Company Shareholder and holder of Company Options (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions).

 



 

(j) Any payments to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this **Article VII** or
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 

(k) Subject to the other limitations set forth in this **Section 7.3** , the
maximum aggregate amount that an Indemnified Party may recover from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to claims for

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification pursuant to a breach of the covenant contained in **Section
5.10(c)** shall be limited to 50% of such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Fund.

 



 

 ** _7.4 Exclusive Remedy_**. Except for any claims or causes of actions
under applicable law arising out of fraud or willful misrepresentation under
this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, if the Merger is consummated, the
indemnification remedies set forth in this **Article VII** shall be the
exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company in this Agreement, any
Related Agreement (to which the Company is a party) or any certificate or
other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _7.5 Escrow Arrangements_**. At or prior to the Closing, Parent, the
Company and the Shareholder Representative shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit I** (the " **Escrow
Agreement** "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount
with the Escrow Agent without any act of the Shareholders or holders of
Company Options, such deposit of the Escrow Amount to constitute an escrow
fund (the " **Escrow Fund** ") to be governed by the terms set forth in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be available as
partial security for the indemnification obligations set forth in this
**Article VII** and to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by
such parties for any Losses paid, incurred or sustained by them and for which
they are entitled to recovery under this **Article VII** **** as provided in
the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, any
amount of the Escrow Amount remaining in the Escrow Fund that is not subject

and the Optionholders on the Survival Date.

 



 

 ** _7.6 Claims for Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) **_Claims for Indemnification_**. For the purposes hereof, " **Officer s
Certificate**" shall mean a certificate signed by an executive officer of
Parent (A) stating that an Indemnified Party has sustained or incurred, or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to sustain or incur, any amount of
Losses; and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was sustained or
incurred, or the basis for such anticipated Liability, and, if applicable, the
nature of the misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant to which
such item is related.

 



 

(b) **_Objections to Claims_**.

 



 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the
Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
accordance with the terms of this **Article VII**. At the time of delivery of
any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered by the Indemnified Party to the Shareholder
Representative (and the Indemnifying Party, if applicable) (the date of such
delivery, the " **Claim Date** ") and for a period of 45 days after the Claim
Date, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any portion of the
Escrow Fund unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization
from the Shareholder Representative to make such delivery. After the
expiration of such 45 day period, the Parent shall be entitled to instruct the
Escrow Agent to release to the Parent from the Escrow Fund an amount in value
equal to the amount of Losses set forth in the Officers Certificate;
_provided_ that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholder
Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the
Officers Certificate (an " **Objection Notice** "); _provided_ _further_
that, to be effective, such Objection Notice must (A) be delivered to Parent
and the Escrow Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the 45th day following
the Claim Date of such Officers Certificate (such

 



      
 

 



 

deadline, the " **Objection Deadline** " for such Officers Certificate and
the claims for indemnification contained therein) and (B) set forth in
reasonable detail the nature of the objections to the claims in respect of
which the objection is made.

 



 

(ii) If the Shareholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party(s), in the
event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such
Indemnifying Party(s)) does not object in writing (as provided in **Section
7.6(b)(i)** ) to the claims contained in an Officers Certificate prior to the
Objection Deadline for such Officers Certificate, such failure to object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Shareholder Representative and
the Indemnifying Party(s) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and
such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established).

 



 

(c) **_Resolution of Conflicts_**.

 



 

(i) In the event that the Shareholder Representative delivers an Objection
Notice in accordance with **Section 7.6(b)** , the Shareholder Representative
and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each such claim. If the Shareholder
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to 30 days after delivery of an Objection Notice (or such longer period
as may be mutually agreed upon by the Shareholder Representative and Parent),
either Parent or the Shareholder Representative may pursue legal action to
seek resolution of such dispute pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) **_Third Party Claims_**. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any
action, suit or proceeding initiated by a third party (a " **Third Party
Claim** ") that Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against the
Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this **Article VII** ,
Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholder Representative of such claim
(provided that any failure by Parent to promptly notify the Shareholder
Representative of such claim shall not limit Parents right to indemnification
under this **Article VII** unless such failure resulted in the notice being
delivered after the expiration of the relevant survival period specified in
**Section 7.1** or unless such failure materially prejudices the Shareholder
Representative). The Shareholder Representative shall be entitled, on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties, at their expense, to participate in, but not to
determine or conduct the defense of any such claim. Such participation shall
include the right to consult with Parent regarding the selection of outside
legal counsel and the budget to be used by such counsel, but the Shareholder
Representative shall have no ability to determine, or right to consent to,
Parents determinations. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that except with the consent of the Shareholder Representative, any
settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall (i)
not be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter or
whether a breach has occurred and (ii) include a complete release of claims
against the Indemnifying Parties by such third party (without limiting the
rights to indemnification of Parent against the Indemnifying Parties). In the
event that the Shareholder Representative has consented to any such
settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to
object under any provision of this **Section 7.6(d)** to the amount of any
Third Party Claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, or against the
Indemnifying Parties directly, as the case may be, with respect to such
settlement.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Third Party Claim with respect to Taxes
shall be governed by the provisions of **Section 5.9**.

 



 

 ** _7.7 Shareholder Representative_**.

 



 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Indemnifying Parties and/or entering into a Joinder Agreement, each of the
Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Christopher
Leigh Rodgers as its agent and attorney-in-fact as the Shareholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to do and perform
every act and thing reasonably necessary or desirable to be done in
connections with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including
without limitation:

 



 

(i) to give and receive notices and communications under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any Expense Escrow Agreement,

 



 

(ii) to determine the presence (or absence) of claims for payment pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Expense Escrow Agreement, and to
authorize delivery to the Indemnified Parties of cash and Escrow Shares from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Indemnified Parties, and to make
payments from the Shareholder Representative Fund;

 



 

(iii) to object to and defend against such claims under this Agreement, and to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements, adjustments and compromises of,
and comply with orders of courts and awards with respect to such claims;

 



 

(iv) undertake legal action with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of any other claim by any Indemnified
Party against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against
any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any
such Indemnifying Party;

 



 

(v) to engage and employ agents and representatives (including accountants,
legal counsel and other professionals) and to incur such other expenses as the
Shareholder Representative reasonably deems necessary or prudent in connection
with the administration of his duties hereunder;

 



 

(vi) to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party; and

 



 

(vii) to take all actions that are either (A) deemed necessary, desirable or
appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (B) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement, including entering into the Escrow Agreement and the Expense
Escrow Agreement;

 



 

in each case relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Expense
Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
Shareholder Representative may resign as Shareholder Representative at any
time with or without cause by giving 30 days prior written notice to the
holders of interest of the Escrow Fund, Parent and Escrow Agent, such
resignation to be effective no sooner than 30 days following the date such
notice is given. In addition, such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying
Parties from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholder Representative may not
be removed or any change to the agency made unless holders of a two-thirds
interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent or such change. A vacancy in the position of Shareholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of two-thirds in

 



      
 

 



 

interest of the Escrow Fund. In the event of the death, disability,
resignation or removal of the Shareholder Representative, a successor or
replacement Shareholder Representative shall be appointed no later than ten
days following the last date of service of the Shareholder Representative that
is being replaced. In the event that a successor Shareholder Representative is
not appointed within such ten day period, the Parent, Escrow Agent and other
parties to the Escrow Agreement and the Expense Escrow Agreement shall be
entitled to rely on any action of the holders of a two-thirds interest of the
Escrow Fund as the action of all of the holders in interest of the Escrow
Fund, and such two-thirds interest of holders shall have all of the rights and
duties of the Shareholder Representative hereunder and under the Escrow
Agreement and Expense Escrow Agreement. No bond shall be required of the
Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall not
receive any compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
from the Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

 



 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative
shall constitute a decision of all the holders in interest of the Escrow Fund
for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount or Expense Escrow Amount otherwise
issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Shareholder
Representative Fund and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon each of
such holders in interest of the Escrow Fund, and the Escrow Agent and Parent
may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each every such Shareholder and Optionholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent
are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative

 



 

(c) The Shareholder Representative shall not, by reason of this Agreement,
have a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Shareholder or Optionholder.
The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Shareholder Representative or by any agent employed by him,
except to the extent that he is determined to have acted with gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence that the Shareholder Representative did
not act with gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties
on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall,
severally and not jointly (based on their Pro Rata Portion), indemnify the
Shareholder Representative and hold the Shareholder Representative harmless
against any loss, Liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Shareholder Representative. In the event
that the Shareholder Representative pays any amounts to any Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement or the Expense Escrow Agreement, or incurs any liability for which
he is entitled to indemnification by the Recipients under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Expense Escrow Agreement, or incurs any expenses
(including attorneys or accounting fees) pursuant thereto or in connection
therewith or pays any fees or taxes on behalf of the Shareholders or
Optionholders thereunder (a " **Shareholder Representative Expense** "), the
Shareholder Representative shall be reimbursed for such Shareholder
Representative Expenses (or may have funds to cover such expenses advanced)
from the Shareholder Representative Fund Amount, which will be deposited by
Parent into an account established under the Expense Escrow Agreement for use
by the Shareholder Representative (the " **Shareholder Representative Fund**
").

 



 

(d) The Shareholder Representative Fund shall be available to compensate the
Shareholder Representative for any Shareholder Representative Expenses and to
pay any third party expenses incurred in connection with the defense,
investigation or settlement of any claim from an Indemnified Party or any
Third Party Claim under or related to this Agreement, as well as any costs or
expenses associated with the

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholder Representative Fund. At any time and from time to time, the
Shareholder Representative may deliver to the Escrow Agent written
instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute all or a portion of
the Expense Escrow Amount. In accordance with the terms set forth in the
Expense Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Shareholder
Representative (or any Person who the Shareholder Representative designates as
the recipient of such disbursement in his written instructions) funds from the
Shareholder Representative Fund in an amount and in the manner set forth in
such written instructions (up to the amount that is available in the
Shareholder Representative Fund). For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that: (A) the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the written instructions of the Shareholder Representative
with respect to the Shareholder Representative Fund; (B) Parents consent
shall not be required to release any funds from the Shareholder Representative
Fund and Parent shall have no right or standing to object to the release or
holding of the Shareholder Representative Fund; and (C) the Shareholder
Representative shall have the sole authority to instruct the release or
holding of the Shareholder Representative Fund. If the Shareholder
Representative shall have delivered written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Shareholder
Representative Fund to the Shareholder Representative and there are not
sufficient funds in the Shareholder Representative Fund to cover such
requested amount, the difference between the amount requested to be released
by the Shareholder Representative from the Shareholder Representative Fund to
the amount actually released to the Shareholder Representative may be
recovered by the Shareholder Representative from the Escrow Fund amounts
otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement at the time of such distribution; _provided_ , that while this
section allows the Shareholder Representative to be paid from the Escrow Fund,
this does not relieve the Shareholders and Optionholders from their obligation
to promptly pay their pro rata portion of any such losses, liabilities or
expenses (based on the Pro Rata Portion, nor does it prevent the Shareholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
Prior to any such distribution from the Escrow Fund, the Shareholder
Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth
the Shareholder Representative Expenses actually incurred. A written and
signed decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement,
shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties, and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved
from any Liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(e) Any unused portion of the Representative Expense Fund held pursuant to the
terms hereof shall be distributed to the Escrow Participants on the earlier of
(a) the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, or (b) the date that the
Shareholder Representative provides written instructions authorizing such
disbursement (such date, the " ** _Shareholder Representative Fund Release
Date_** "), and shall be disbursed in the same manner by the Escrow Agent as
the disbursement of the Escrow Amount based on each Escrow Participants Pro
Rata Portion. The Shareholder Representative will provide an accounting to the
Shareholders, no less than annually, of its use of the funds in the
Shareholder Representative Fund, though no accounting will be due if there is
no change in the status of such account. From time to time after Closing,
additional funds may be received by the Shareholder Representative for the
benefit of the Shareholders (such as tax refunds related to pre-Closing
periods) and the Shareholder Representative may deposit such funds into the
Shareholder Representative Fund.

satisfied and such breach has not been cured within 20 days after written
notice thereof is received by Parent; _provided, however_ , that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured.

 



 

 ** _8.2 Effect of Termination._** In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in **Section 8.1** hereof, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no Liability or obligation on the

any willful breach of this Agreement; and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
that, the provisions of **Section 8.2** and **Article IX **shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to the terms of this **Article VIII**.

Representative shall be binding upon and effective against the Shareholders

such partys agent for acceptance of legal process.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
