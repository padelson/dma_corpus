\- 36 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Sellers shall, within 30 days after its receipt of the Proposed
Closing Date Acquisition Statement, inform the Purchaser in writing (the
"Sellers' Objection"), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of any
dispute the Sellers may have with respect to any information contained in the
Proposed Closing Date Acquisition Statement and the Sellers' determination and

UPB, the Closing Date Whole Mortgage Loan UPB, the Closing Date Servicing
Interests Purchase Price, the Closing Date Platform Purchase Price, the
Closing Date Servicer Advance Purchase Price or the Closing Date Shortfall
Amount, as the case may be, that the Sellers propose should be made. If no
Sellers' Objection is received by the Purchaser on or before the last day of
such 30-day period, then the Proposed Closing Date Acquisition Statement,
including the Closing Date Securitization Mortgage Loan UPB, the Closing Date
Whole Mortgage Loan UPB, the Closing Date Servicing Interests Purchase Price,
the Closing Date Platform Purchase Price, the Closing Date Servicer Advance
Purchase Price and the Closing Date Shortfall Amount set forth therein, shall

(c) If the Sellers timely submit the Sellers' Objection to the Purchaser in
accordance with Section 2.08(b), the Sellers and the Purchaser first shall
seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement over the disputed items set
forth in the Sellers' Objection. If any disagreement cannot be resolved by the
Purchaser and the Sellers within 30 days after the Purchaser's receipt of the
Sellers' Objection, then either the Purchaser or the Sellers, by written
notice to the other, may elect to have any such disagreement tendered to and
resolved by a mutually agreeable internationally recognized independent
certified public accounting firm (the "Accountant"), which shall determine, on
the basis set forth in and in accordance with Section 2.08(a), and only with
respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what extent,
if any, the Closing Date Securitization Mortgage Loan UPB, the Closing Date
Whole Mortgage Loan UPB, the Closing Date Servicing Interests Purchase Price,
the Closing Date Platform Purchase Price, the Closing Date Servicer Advance
Purchase Price or the Closing Date Shortfall Amount as set forth in the
Proposed Closing Date Acquisition Statement require adjustment. The
determination by the Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto for all purposes of this Agreement. Each of the Parent and the

of the Accountant. The Accountant shall have full access to all information
used by the Purchaser in preparing the Proposed Closing Date Acquisition
Statement and by the Sellers' in preparing the Sellers' Objection, including
the work papers of their respective accountants (to the extent permitted by
such accountants), and all other information reasonably requested by the
Accountant from the Sellers and the Purchaser. The Accountant shall be
instructed to submit its determination to the parties hereto in writing as
soon as practicable after submission of the matter to it but no later than
thirty (30) days after such submission. The Accountant shall be limited to
deciding the Final Securitization Mortgage Loan UPB, the Final Whole Mortgage
Loan UPB, the Final Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Final Platform
Purchase Price, the Final Servicer Advance Purchase Price and the Final
Shortfall Amount, as the case may be, in an amount which shall be equal to or
in between the amounts proposed for such items by the Purchaser in the
Proposed Closing Date Acquisition Statement and the Sellers in the Sellers'
Objection, but no more and no less.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 37 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Once the parties hereto agree upon or otherwise arrive at, or once the
Accountant has made a final determination on, the Final Securitization
Mortgage Loan UPB, the Final Whole Mortgage Loan UPB, the Final Servicing
Interests Purchase Price, the Final Platform Purchase Price, the Final
Servicer Advance Purchase Price and the Final Shortfall Amount pursuant to the
foregoing procedures, the Final Servicing Interests Purchase Price shall be
compared to the Estimated Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Final
Platform Purchase Price shall be compared to the Estimated Platform Purchase
Price, the Final Servicer Advance Purchase Price shall be compared to the
Estimated Servicer Advance Purchase Price and the Final Shortfall Amount shall
be compared to the Estimated Shortfall Amount. To the extent the Final
Servicing Interests Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Servicing
Interests Purchase Price, the Final Platform Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Platform Purchase Price or the Final Servicer Advance Purchase Price
is less than the Estimated Servicer Advance Purchase Price, as the case may
be, then for each dollar that the Final Servicing Interests Purchase Price is
less than the Estimated Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Final Platform
Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Platform Purchase Price or the Final
Servicer Advance Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Servicer Advance
Purchase Price, one dollar shall be repaid to the Purchaser by the Sellers
within 10 days following such determination as a reduction from the Estimated
Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Estimated Platform Purchase Price or
the Estimated Servicer Advance Purchase Price, as the case may be, together
with interest on the foregoing amount for the period from and including the
Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate. To the extent the Final Shortfall Amount is
less than the Estimated Shortfall Amount, then for each dollar that the Final
Shortfall Amount is less than the Estimated Shortfall Amount, one dollar shall
be paid to the Sellers by the Purchaser within 10 days following such
determination, together with interest on the foregoing amount for the period
from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such
payment at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. To the extent the
Final Servicing Interests Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Final Platform Purchase Price is
greater than the Estimated Platform Purchase Price or the Final Servicer
Advance Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Servicer Advance Purchase
Price, then for each dollar that the Final Servicing Interests Purchase Price
is greater than the Estimated Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Final
Platform Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Platform Purchase Price
or the Final Servicer Advance Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Servicer Advance Purchase Price, one dollar shall be paid to the Sellers by
the Purchaser within 10 days following such determination as an increase to
the Estimated Servicing Interests Purchase Price, the Estimated Platform
Purchase Price or the Estimated Servicer Advance Purchase Price, as the case
may be, together with interest on the foregoing amount for the period from and
including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. To the extent the Final
Shortfall Amount is greater than the Estimated Shortfall Amount, then for each
dollar that the Final Shortfall Amount is greater than the Estimated Shortfall
Amount, one dollar shall be paid to the Purchaser by the Sellers within 10
days following such determination, together with interest on the foregoing
amount for the period from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding,
the date of such payment at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

  

  

(e) Any amounts owed to one party pursuant to Section 2.08(d) shall be netted
against any amount owed by such party pursuant to Section 2.08(d) prior to any
applicable payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 38 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The provisions in this Section 2.08 relating to resolutions of disputes by
an Accountant are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to require that
the parties hereto refer to such a firm any dispute arising out of a breach by
one of the parties hereto of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 2.09. Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Clawback.

  

  

(a) A "Clawback Event" shall occur with respect to any Servicer Advance
Receivable if: (1) the applicable trustee, owner or other party in interest to
the applicable Servicing Agreement or the Mortgage Loans to which such
Servicing Agreement relates denies reimbursement for such Servicer Advance
Receivable in writing on the ground that such Servicer Advance Receivable is a
Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable (a "Clawback (1) Event"); or (2) the
Purchaser reasonably determines that such Servicer Advance Receivable is a
Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable and delivers evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers that such Servicer Advance Receivable is a Non-
Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable (a "Clawback (2) Event"). Any Clawback
(1) Event and any Clawback (2) Event shall each be a Clawback Event for
purposes of this Section 2.09.

  

  

(b) With respect to any Servicer Advances made by or on behalf of the Sellers
on or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts for thirty days to seek the reimbursement or collection of
the related Servicer Advance Receivable in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Servicing Agreement; provided that the Purchaser shall not be
obligated to seek the reimbursement or collection of any Servicer Advance
Receivable if a Clawback (2) Event occurs with respect to such Servicer
Advance Receivable (it being agreed that the foregoing proviso shall not be
applicable with respect to any Servicer Advance Receivable related to a
Servicer Advance that was made by or on behalf of the Sellers on or prior to
the Closing Date to a vendor or other third party (even where the Purchaser
reasonably believes that such Servicer Advance Receivable is a Non-Qualified
Servicer Advance Receivable) and that the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts for thirty days to seek the reimbursement or collection of
such Servicer Advance Receivable). For the avoidance of doubt, "commercially
reasonable efforts" under this Section 2.09(b) shall include requiring the
Purchaser to use, in accordance with its policies and practices, at least the
same standard of care and diligence (but not less than a reasonable standard
of care and diligence) it would exercise in seeking the reimbursement or
collection of servicer advance receivables not subject to a provision similar
to this Section 2.09.

  

  

(c) If a Clawback (1) Event occurs with respect to any Servicer Advance
Receivable, the Purchaser shall provide a written notice (each, a "Non-
Qualified Advance Notice") to the Sellers as promptly as practicable after any
request for reimbursement of such Servicer Advance Receivable is denied or
refused, which notice shall include (i) details of the Purchaser's efforts to
seek reimbursement of the relevant Servicer Advance Receivable and any amounts
actually collected by the Purchaser with respect to such Servicer Advance
Receivable as of the date of such notice, and (ii) all written notices
received by the Purchaser in response to the Purchaser's requests for
reimbursement of such Servicer Advance Receivable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 39 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If (i) a Clawback (1) Event occurs with respect to a Servicer Advance
Receivable, within 25 days following the Sellers' receipt of a Non-Qualified
Advance Notice with respect to such Servicer Advance Receivable, or (ii) a
Clawback (2) Event occurs with respect to a Servicer Advance Receivable,
within 25 days following such occurrence, then (A) the Sellers shall pay to
the Purchaser in respect of such Servicer Advance Receivable (each, a
"Clawback Payment"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account to be designated in writing by the Purchaser, an amount in cash equal
to (1) the portion of the Final Servicer Advance Purchase Price paid by the
Purchaser with respect to such Servicer Advance Receivable less (2) any
amounts actually collected by the Purchaser with respect to such Servicer
Advance Receivable as of the date that such payment is made by the Sellers,
and (B) the Purchaser shall convey and deliver back to the Sellers all right,
title and interest, if any, in and to such Servicer Advance Receivable for no
additional consideration and without representation or warranty of any kind;
provided, however, that the Sellers shall have no obligation to make any
Clawback Payment pursuant to clause (ii) above with respect to any Servicer
Advance Receivable that the relevant Verification Agent (as defined below) has
determined pursuant to this clause (d) is not a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance
Receivable hereunder. If, with respect to a Clawback (2) Event, the Sellers
disagree with the Purchaser's determination that a Servicer Advance Receivable
is a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable, the Purchaser shall
immediately engage The Capital Markets Company Inc. (commonly known as
"Capco") or another similar vendor reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers
(each, a "Verification Agent") to determine whether such Servicer Advance
Receivable constitutes a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable hereunder.
The Purchaser shall instruct the Verification Agent to submit its
determination as to whether the Servicer Advance Receivable at issue
constitutes a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable hereunder to the
parties hereto in writing as soon as practicable after submission of the
matter to it but no later than twenty-five (25) days after such submission.

  

  

(i) If the Verification Agent determines that such Servicer Advance Receivable
does constitute a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable hereunder, then
(A) the Sellers shall make a Clawback Payment to the Purchaser with respect to
such Servicer Advance Receivable in accordance with this Section 2.09(d), and
(B) the Sellers shall reimburse the Purchaser for all reasonable costs and
expenses directly incurred by the Purchaser in engaging such Verification
Agent within ten Business Days following the Purchaser's written request for
reimbursement therefor, which written request shall also include reasonable
evidence of all costs and expenses for which the Purchaser is seeking
reimbursement.

  

  

(ii) If the Verification Agent determines that such Servicer Advance
Receivable does not constitute a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable
hereunder, then (A) the Sellers shall have no obligation to make any Clawback
Payment to the Purchaser with respect to such Servicer Advance Receivable, and
(B) the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses
incurred by the Verification Agent and/or the Purchaser in engaging such
Verification Agent.

  

  

(iii) If the Verification Agent's determination has not been delivered by the
25th day following the occurrence of the claimed Clawback Event, the Sellers
shall pay the related Clawback Payment to the Purchaser on or before such 25th
day, but the Purchaser shall promptly refund such Clawback Payment to the
Sellers if the Verification Agent subsequently determines that the related
Servicer Advance Receivable was not a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance
Receivable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 40 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

In addition, if any Clawback Payment is made with respect to a Servicer
Advance Receivable, and any amounts are reimbursed or paid to the Purchaser
with respect to such Servicer Advance Receivable, then the Purchaser will
promptly (but in no event later than thirty days following receipt thereof)
forward and pay to the Sellers such amounts, but only to the extent such
amounts were not taken into account in calculating the Clawback Payment
payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser in respect of such Servicer Advance
Receivable. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Sellers have any
obligation pursuant to this Section 2.09 or otherwise to make any Clawback
Payment to the Purchaser for any Servicer Advances made by or on behalf of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates or any other Person following the Closing.

  

  

(e) The rights and remedies of the Purchaser under this Section 2.09 with
respect to any Clawback Event are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other
rights and remedies that the Purchaser may have under this Agreement or
otherwise with respect to any Clawback Event, any Servicer Advance Receivable
that is a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable, any failure of the
Purchaser to be reimbursed for any Servicer Advance Receivable because such
Servicer Advance Receivable is a Non-Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable or
any fact, circumstance or event to the extent forming the basis thereof,
including any rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02 as the result
of any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.15(a). The Purchaser hereby expressly waives any and all other rights or
causes of action it or its Affiliates may have against the Sellers or their
Affiliates now or in the future under any Law with respect to any Clawback
Event, any Servicer Advance Receivable that is a Non-Qualified Servicer
Advance Receivable, any failure of the Purchaser to be reimbursed for any
Servicer Advance Receivable because such Servicer Advance Receivable is a Non-
Qualified Servicer Advance Receivable or any fact, circumstance or event to
the extent forming the basis thereof. The Purchaser shall apply any Clawback
Payment received from the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.09 as an
"Indemnity Payment" under, and as defined in, the Servicing Advance Financing
Agreements, but only if any notes issued under such Servicing Advance
Financing Agreements are still outstanding.

  

  

SECTION 2.10. Holdback Receivables.

  

  

(a) Schedule 2.10 sets forth a list of certain low balance Servicing
Agreements which the Purchaser and the Sellers have agreed shall be subject to
the holdback provisions of this Section 2.10, except to the extent any such
Servicing Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date or not transferred
to the Purchaser on the Closing Date, in which case such Schedule 2.10 shall
be updated by the parties as of the Closing. Each Servicer Advance Receivable
attributable to a Servicing Agreement listed on Schedule 2.10, as updated to
the extent necessary (each, a "Holdback Agreement" and collectively, the
"Holdback Agreements") (i) in existence on the Closing Date, or (ii)
attributable to a Servicer Advance made after the Closing Date that is not a
PandI Advance, shall be referred to as a "Holdback Receivable." Schedule 2.10,
as updated to the extent necessary, shall set forth the total amount
outstanding with respect to each Holdback Receivable as of the Closing Date,
and the aggregate amount of Holdback Receivables under each Holdback Agreement
as of the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 41 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek the
reimbursement or collection of each Holdback Receivable in accordance with the
terms of the related Holdback Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
"commercially reasonable efforts" under this Section 2.10(b) shall include
requiring the Purchaser to use, in accordance with its policies and practices,
at least the same standard of care and diligence (but not less than a
reasonable standard of care and diligence) it would exercise in seeking the
reimbursement or collection of Servicer Advance Receivables not subject to a
provision similar to this Section 2.10. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall reimburse itself for any Servicer Advances
related to the Holdback Receivables out of late collections, liquidation
proceeds or other amounts collected in respect of the related Mortgage Loan
from the related Mortgagor, from insurance proceeds, from a buyer of the
related Mortgage Loan or the underlying Mortgaged Property or REO Property, or
from a counterparty to the related Servicing Agreement paid to reimburse the
Servicer Advances related to such related Holdback Receivables, and shall
reimburse itself out of general collections in the appropriate custodial
account maintained with respect to the related Servicing Agreement for the
Servicer Advances related to such Holdback Receivables, in each case to the
extent permitted to do so under the Applicable Requirements. Except to the
extent expressly prohibited under the Applicable Requirements, all Servicer
Advances under the Holdback Agreements shall be reimbursed on a "FIFO" basis,
such that the oldest Servicer Advances made under any such Holdback Agreement
shall be reimbursed first out of amounts available to reimburse Servicer
Advances under the related Servicing Agreements, and, except to the extent
expressly prohibited under the Applicable Requirements, the Purchaser shall
use amounts available under the Holdback Agreements to reimburse Servicer
Advances to reimburse Holdback Receivables before using such funds to
reimburse any PandI Advances made under the Holdback Agreements after the
Closing Date.

  

  

(c) On the tenth (10th) Business Day following the last day of each three-
month period during the Holdback Period and within ten (10) Business Days
after the end of the final month in the Holdback Period (it being understood
that if the Closing occurs on October 1, 2010, the first such schedule shall
be provided on January 14, 2011 and the last such schedule shall be provided
on November 13, 2014), the Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers (1) a true
and accurate schedule (each, a "Quarterly Schedule") setting forth, with
respect to each Holdback Receivable (as well as all Holdback Receivables in
the aggregate): (A) the amount of each Holdback Receivable outstanding, and
the aggregate amount of all Holdback Receivables outstanding under each
Holdback Agreement, as of the end of such three-month period or shorter period
in the case of the final Quarterly Schedule (each, a "Statement Period"); (B)
the amount of each Holdback Receivable outstanding, and the aggregate amount
of all Holdback Receivables outstanding under each Holdback Agreement, as of
the end of the immediately preceding Statement Period; (C) the amount of each
Holdback Receivable outstanding, and the aggregate amount of all Holdback
Receivables outstanding under each Holdback Agreement, as of the Closing Date;
(D) the amount of each Holdback Receivable outstanding as of the end of the
immediately preceding Statement Period that was created after the Closing
Date, and the aggregate amount of all Holdback Receivables outstanding as of
the end of the immediately preceding Statement Period that were created under
each Holdback Agreement after the Closing Date; (E) the aggregate amount of
all PandI Advances made under each Holdback Agreement after the Closing Date,
and the amounts of such PandI Advances that have been reimbursed with respect to
each Holdback Agreement as of the end of the immediately preceding Statement
Period; (F) the amount of each Holdback Receivable with respect to which the
related Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property was finally liquidated during the
immediately preceding Statement Period without reimbursement of the related
Holdback Receivable due to the insufficiency of related Mortgage Loan proceeds
and of collections with respect to the related Mortgage Loan pool to reimburse
the related Servicer Advances, in each case after application of the related
Mortgage Loan proceeds and, thereafter, of available pool collections, to
reimburse the related Servicer Advances before using such funds to pay any
other amounts with respect to the related Holdback Agreement, except to the
extent such allocation is expressly prohibited by the terms of the related
Holdback Agreement (any portion of a Holdback Receivable that remains unpaid
after application of such amounts following the liquidation of the related
Mortgaged Property shall be referred to herein as a "Holdback Receivable Final
Loss"); and (G) the aggregate amount of Holdback Receivable Final Losses
incurred during the immediately preceding Statement Period under each Holdback
Agreement (without duplication of amounts already paid in the case of the
final Statement Period), including a statement of the amount of liquidation
proceeds paid with respect to the related Mortgage Loan and the amount applied
to pay related Holdback Receivables, and the amount of pool collections
collected during the related Statement Period and the amount thereof used to
pay Holdback Receivables that were not recovered out of loan-level proceeds or
collections, (2) reasonably detailed documentation for such Quarterly
Schedule, and (3) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Purchaser
certifying that such Quarterly Schedule was prepared reasonably and in good
faith, in accordance with this Section 2.10(c) and in a manner consistent with
the books of account and other financial records of the Purchaser.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 42 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) On the tenth (10th) Business Day following the receipt of any such
Quarterly Schedule (each such date, as it may be extended pursuant to this
Section 2.10(d) due to disputes regarding the Quarterly Schedule, a "Holdback
Release Date"), the parties shall deliver Joint Written Instructions to
release, and shall cause the Escrow Agent to release:

  

  

(i) to the Purchaser an amount equal to the lesser of (X) the Escrow Funds and
(Y) the aggregate amount of any Holdback Receivable Final Losses incurred in
the immediately preceding Statement Period (as set forth on such Quarterly
Schedule or, if disputed, as agreed by the parties), and

  

  

(ii) for the Holdback Release Date after the end of the 36th month following
the Closing Date, following the payment to the Purchaser pursuant to clause
(i) above, to the Sellers an amount equal to the greater of (X) $0 and (Y) the
difference of (1) Escrow Funds after giving effect to any payments made on
such Holdback Release Date pursuant to clause (i) above minus (2) $2,000,000;

  

  

provided, however, that if there is any dispute with respect to any Quarterly
Schedule, the parties shall not deliver Joint Written Instructions and the
related Holdback Release Date shall not occur, until such time as such dispute
is resolved. If any amount is paid to the Purchaser under clause (i) of this
Section 2.10(d), in respect of a Holdback Receivable Final Loss, all right,
title and interest in and to the related Holdback Receivable(s), including any
right to pursue remedies against other parties in respect of the Holdback
Receivable Final Loss shall be automatically conveyed and delivered back by
the Purchaser to the Sellers without any representation or warranty of any

Holdback Receivables conveyed and delivered back to the Sellers are
subsequently reimbursed or paid to the Purchaser, including by the receipt of

Loss alleged in such Quarterly Schedule shall be retained in the Escrow
Account until such time as the dispute is resolved between the parties.

or otherwise with respect to any Holdback Receivable Final Loss, or any fact,
circumstance or event to the extent forming the basis thereof, including any
rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02. The Purchaser hereby

Affiliates may have against the Sellers or their Affiliates now or in the
future under any Law with respect to any Holdback Receivable Final Loss or any
fact, circumstance or event to the extent forming the basis thereof. If the
Purchaser is paid for a Holdback Receivable because it is a Non-Qualified
Servicer Advance Receivable pursuant to Section 2.09, such Servicer Advance
Receivable shall no longer be considered as a Holdback Receivable.

by operation of Law will be binding on the Purchaser at any time prior to or
after the Closing.

  

  

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.17(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the execution of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i)
entitle any current or former employees, officers or directors of either of
the Sellers who perform or performed services for the Business to severance
pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after
the date of this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Plans. None of the Plans in
effect immediately prior to the Closing would result separately or in the
aggregate (including as a result of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby) in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

the applicable Seller has not engaged any subservicers, subcontractors or
other agents to perform any of its duties under any of the Servicing

(d) Except as set forth in (i) Section 3.22(d) of the Disclosure Schedule or
(ii) the 1122 and 1123 Servicer's Assessments of Compliance provided pursuant
to Regulation AB with respect to BCRE's servicing platform, the Sellers are in

previously disclosed to the Purchaser prior to the date hereof in the Consumer
Relations reports for 2008, 2009 and 2010 available through the Tumbleweed

Seller has violated, breached or not complied with any Applicable Requirements
in connection with the Servicing of the Mortgage Loans.

SECTION 3.23. Mortgage Loans.

 

  

  

(a) All Custodial Accounts and Related Escrow Accounts are maintained in all
material respects in accordance with Applicable Requirements. Except as to
payments that are deposited in a clearing account for subsequent deposit into
the applicable Custodial Account or Related Escrow Account within two Business
Days, all Custodial Account and Related Escrow Account balances required by
the Mortgage Loan Documents and paid to the Sellers for the account of the
Mortgagor and the Sellers are on deposit in the appropriate Custodial
Accounts.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, all
payments for Taxes, assessments, ground rents, mortgage insurance, hazard and
flood insurance or other payments made from the Related Escrow Accounts have
been made as required by Applicable Requirements in all material respects, and
the Sellers have paid to the Mortgagor interest on any such payments deposited
in the Related Escrow Accounts to the extent such payment is required by
Applicable Requirements.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, within
the 12-month period prior to the date hereof, the Sellers have analyzed the
payments required to be deposited into the Related Escrow Accounts and
adjusted the payments thereto in order to eliminate any deficiency that the
Sellers may have discovered, except with respect to Mortgage Loans received by
the Sellers within the 12-month period prior to the date hereof. Where
required by Applicable Requirements, the Sellers have notified each Mortgagor,
in accordance with the Applicable Requirements, as to any payment adjustments
which resulted from an escrow analysis.

  

  

(d) Except as disclosed to the Purchaser on the March 31 Data Tape or in the
Data Base and consistent with the Applicable Requirements or as set forth in
Section 3.23(d) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers have not waived any
material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, except for
deferrals of interest, the modification of payment terms pursuant to a written
loan modification or forbearance agreement, the waiver of fees incidental to
the mitigation of losses on delinquent Mortgage Loans or as otherwise required
under the SPA. To the extent that any such waiver is reflected in the March 31
Data Tape and the Data Base, the disclosure relating to such waiver is
reflected consistently in all material respects in the March 31 Data Tape and
the Data Base.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Mortgage Loans are validly insured by a PMI Policy to the extent
required by the applicable Servicing Agreement, except where the failure to be
so insured is not the contractual, legal or financial responsibility of the
Sellers or the Purchaser as the transferee Servicer under Applicable
Requirements, and all premiums or other charges due in connection with such
insurance have been paid, except where the failure to be so paid is not the
contractual, legal or financial responsibility of the Sellers or the Purchaser
as the transferee Servicer. There has been no act or omission by the Sellers
that would or may invalidate any such PMI Policy with respect to the
Purchaser.

  

  

(f) If required by the Applicable Requirements, there is in force with respect
to each Mortgaged Property a hazard insurance policy that provides, at a
minimum, for fire and extended coverage in an amount which is in no event less
than the amount required under such Applicable Requirements. Except as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect, if required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973 or by the applicable Investor, each Mortgaged Property
is and will be covered by a flood insurance policy in an amount not less than
the maximum amount of insurance required under Applicable Requirements. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers, all such insurance policies are in full force and
effect, and all premiums with respect to such policies have been paid and will
inure to the benefit of the Purchaser on behalf of the applicable Investor
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To
the Knowledge of the Sellers, no Seller, Originator or Prior Servicer has
engaged in any act or omission that would materially impair the coverage of
any such policy, the benefits of the endorsement provided for therein, or the
validity and binding effect of either for which the Servicer is responsible to
the Investor under the Servicing Agreement or Underlying Documents or to any
borrower.

  

  

(g) The March 31 Data Tape, the Closing Data Tape, the Loan File, the Data
Base and the Servicer's rights under the applicable Servicing Agreement to
obtain documents maintained by the applicable document custodian, contain all
items, documents, instruments and agreements required to service the Mortgage
Loans under the applicable Servicing Agreement, except to the extent that any
missing item, document, instrument or agreement would not adversely affect the
Purchaser's ability to enforce the terms of the applicable Mortgage Loans
following the Closing Date or the Purchaser's ability to service the
applicable Mortgage Loans following the Closing Date in accordance with the
Applicable Requirements, provided, however, that the Sellers make no
representation as to any trustee's or document custodian's compliance with its
obligations under the applicable Servicing Agreements, or either of the
Sellers' or Originator's obligation to transmit Mortgage Loan Documents to the
applicable trustee or document custodian, except if the Servicer is
responsible under the Servicing Agreement for either.

  

  

(h) Payments received by the Sellers with respect to any Mortgage Loans have
been remitted and properly accounted for as required by Applicable
Requirements in all material respects. All funds received by the Sellers in
connection with the satisfaction of Mortgage Loans, including foreclosure
proceeds and insurance proceeds from hazard losses, have been deposited in the
appropriate Custodial Account and all such funds have been applied to pay
accrued interest on the Mortgage Loans, to reduce the principal balance of the
Mortgage Loans in question, or for reimbursement of repairs to the Mortgaged
Property or as otherwise required by Applicable Requirements and the Servicing
Agreements or permitted by any Servicing Agreements or are and will be in one
of the Custodial Accounts on the Closing Date. Except as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, all Taxes, governmental assessments, insurance
premiums, water, sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments, or ground
rents which previously became due and owing have (to the extent either of the
Sellers maintains a Related Escrow Account with respect thereto) been paid
prior to the imposition of any penalty with respect thereto to the extent so
required to be paid by the Sellers, as Servicer, pursuant to the Applicable
Requirements, or an escrow of funds with respect to Taxes and insurance
premiums has been established in an amount sufficient (based on the most
recent escrow analysis thereof performed in accordance with the Applicable
Requirements) to pay for such item which remains unpaid and which has been
assessed but is not yet due and payable to the extent so required pursuant to
the Applicable Requirements.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 60 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) No Custodial Files for any Mortgage Loan, including with respect to any
Mortgage Loan Document for which the Purchaser is responsible to the Investor,
contains a material deficiency that would have an adverse effect on the
Servicing of such Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Applicable Requirements
and for which the Servicer is responsible under the applicable Servicing
Agreement.

  

  

(j) The Servicing of each Mortgage Loan and REO Property has been performed in
all material respects in accordance with Applicable Requirements.

  

  

(k) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(k) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Servicing Agreements constitutes a Recourse obligation to either of the
Sellers, as Servicer.

  

  

(l) No fraudulent action with respect to a Mortgage Loan has taken place on
the part of either of the Sellers in connection with Servicing any Mortgage
Loan. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, there has been no material fraudulent
action on the part of any other Person (including any borrower, appraiser,
builder or developer, credit reporting agency, settlement agent, realtor,
broker or correspondent, Originator, or Prior Servicer) in connection with (i)
the origination or Servicing of any Mortgage Loan or (ii) the application of
any insurance proceeds with respect to a Mortgage Loan or the Mortgaged
Property, in either case, for which any Seller, in its capacity as the
Servicer, is responsible under the terms of the related Servicing Agreement to
the applicable Investor or Insurer.

  

  

(m) To the Knowledge of the Sellers and to the extent that any Seller, in its
capacity as Servicer, is responsible for such matters to the applicable
Investor or Insurer under the terms of the related Servicing Agreement, each
Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage is genuine and each is the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the maker thereof, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
generally the enforcement of creditor's rights and the discretion of a court
to grant specific performance. To the Knowledge of the Sellers and to the
extent that any Seller, in its capacity as Servicer, is responsible for such
matters to the applicable Investor or Insurer under the terms of the related
Servicing Agreement, no Mortgage Loan is subject to any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense against the Purchaser, including the defense
of usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage Note or
the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the
Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable by the Purchaser, in whole or in
part, or subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense
against the Purchaser, including the defense of usury, and no such right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted to either of
the Sellers or any Originator with respect thereto. Except with respect to
partial releases, actions required by a divorce decree, assumptions, or as
otherwise permitted under Applicable Requirements and documented in the Loan
File, (i) the terms of each Mortgage Note and Mortgage have not been modified
by any Seller or Prior Servicer, (ii) no party thereto has been released in
whole or in part by any Seller or Prior Servicer and (iii) no part of the
Mortgaged Property has been released by any Seller or Prior Servicer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 61 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(n) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(n) of the Disclosure Schedule, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, there exists no material damage to any Mortgaged
Property from fire, windstorm, earthquake, other casualty, environmental
hazard, or any other physical circumstances or conditions relating to the
condition of the Mortgaged Property that would cause any Mortgage Loan to
become delinquent or otherwise materially and adversely affect the value or
marketability of such Mortgage Loan or related Mortgaged Property for which
any Seller is responsible under the applicable Servicing Agreement, except to
the extent covered by in-place hazard insurance or flood insurance or any
Mortgaged Property that is being repaired as permitted by the relevant
Servicing Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, there are no uninsured
casualty losses or casualty losses where coinsurance has been (and the Sellers
have no reason to believe, will be) claimed by an Insurer or where the loss,
exclusive of contents, is greater than the recovery, less actual expenses
incurred in such recovery from the Insurer. Casualty insurance proceeds paid
with respect to a Mortgage Loan have been used either to reduce the Mortgage
Loan balance and pay accrued interest thereon or for the purpose of making
repairs to the Mortgaged Property or as otherwise permitted by any Servicing
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 3.23(n) of the Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no Mortgaged Property has been subject to an
Action seeking total or partial condemnation or forfeiture of such Mortgaged
Property.

  

  

(o) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, no Mortgage Loan is a "high-cost loan," "threshold,"
"predatory" or "covered loan" under either the Home Ownership and Equity
Protection Act of 1994 or any similar federal, state or local anti-predatory
lending Law.

  

 

  

SECTION 3.24. Sufficiency of Purchased Assets. Except as expressly set forth
in Section 3.24 of the Disclosure Schedule and except for the Excluded Assets,
the Excluded Contracts, the Excluded IT Platform, the Excluded Leased Real
Property, the Excluded Personal Property, the Excluded Personal Property
Leases and the property, assets and services contemplated to be provided to
the Purchaser following the Closing pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, the Purchased Assets, whether real or personal, tangible or
intangible, comprise all of the assets, properties and rights that are
necessary to conduct the Business as it is currently conducted consistent with
past practice in all material respects.

 

  

 

  

SECTION 3.25. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Sellers.

representations and warranties contained in this Article III, neither the
Sellers nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation
or warranty to the Purchaser.

to in Section 4.03, except as may result from any facts or circumstances
relating solely to the Sellers or their respective Affiliates, the execution,

against the Servicer or involve Mortgage Loans that constitute "high-cost
loan," "threshold," "predatory" or "covered loan" under either the Home

hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any Person) any
and all confidential or proprietary information, knowledge and data relating

same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to
prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such Purchaser
Confidential Information as the Sellers or their Affiliates used with respect
thereto prior to the execution of this Agreement, unless the Purchaser
provides its prior written consent to such use or disclosure or except as
otherwise permitted in this Section 5.03(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that the Sellers or any such agent, representative, Affiliate,
employee, officer or director becomes legally compelled by Governmental Order
or is required by the rules and regulations or any action of any applicable
Self-Regulatory Organization to disclose any such Purchaser Confidential
Information, disclosure in compliance with this Section 5.03(a) shall be
permitted and, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by
applicable Law, the Sellers agree to, and shall cause their respective agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to, (i) provide
the Purchaser with reasonable written notice of such requirement so that the
Purchaser may seek a protective order or other remedy, (ii) in the event that
such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, furnish only that
portion of such Purchaser Confidential Information which is legally required

Confidential Information it intends to furnish or has furnished; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any information (A) that at the
time of disclosure, is available publicly or becomes publicly available
through no act or omission of the party owing a duty of confidentiality, or
becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
party owing a duty of confidentiality, so long as such source is not known by
such party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
obligations of secrecy to the other party, (B) that is developed independently
by the Sellers without the use of the Purchaser Confidential Information, (C)
that is disclosed to any directors, officers, employees, advisors and other

provisions of this Section 5.03(a) or (D) that the Sellers are required to
preserve and retain by Law. The Sellers agree and acknowledge that remedies at
Law for any breach of their obligations under this Section 5.03(a) are
inadequate and that in addition thereto the Purchaser shall be entitled to
seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the
event of any such breach.

and directors to, treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide
access to any Person) all confidential or proprietary information relating to
the business of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than that relating to
the Purchased Assets) ("Seller Confidential Information") that becomes known
to the Purchaser or its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees,
officers and directors in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and not otherwise use such Seller
Confidential Information, unless the Sellers provide their prior written
consent to such disclosure or except as otherwise permitted by this Section
5.03(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Purchaser or any
such agent, representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director becomes
legally compelled by Governmental Order or is required by the rules and
regulations or any action of any applicable Self-Regulatory Organization to
disclose any such Seller Confidential Information, disclosure in compliance
with this Section 5.03(b) shall be permitted and, to the extent reasonably
practicable and permitted by applicable Law, the Purchaser agrees to, and
shall cause its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and
directors to, (i) provide the Sellers with reasonable written notice of such
requirement so that the Sellers may seek a protective order or other remedy,
(ii) in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained,
furnish only that portion of such Seller Confidential Information which is
legally required to be provided and exercise its reasonable best efforts to
obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Seller
Confidential Information, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly furnish to the Sellers a copy (in whatever form or medium) of such
Seller Confidential Information it intends to furnish or has furnished;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any information that
(A) at the time of disclosure, is available publicly or becomes publicly
available through no act or omission of the party owing a duty of
confidentiality, or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the party owing a duty of confidentiality, so long as such
source is not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement
with or other obligations of secrecy to the other party, (B) that is developed
independently by the Purchaser without the use of the Seller Confidential
Information, (C) that is disclosed to any directors, officers, employees,
advisors and other representatives of the Purchaser to whom such disclosure is
necessary or desirable in the conduct of the business of the Purchaser if such
Persons are informed by the Purchaser of the confidential nature of such
Seller Confidential Information and are directed by the Purchaser to comply
with the provisions of this Section 5.03(b) or (D) that the Purchaser is
required to preserve and retain by Law. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that remedies at Law for any breach of its obligations under this Section
5.03(b) are inadequate and that in addition thereto the Sellers shall be
entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific
performance, in the event of any such breach.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 70 -

approvals and make all filings with all Governmental Authorities, FNMA, GNMA
and FHLMC and officials that are or become necessary for its execution and
delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and will cooperate fully with the
other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals.

  

  

(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Third Party Consents and Servicing Agreement Consents,

shall allocate the costs and expenses of complying with this Section 5.04(b)

(a) Notwithstanding the commitment made by the Sellers under the Commitment
Letter to provide the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility on and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter and the Senior Secured Term Loan
Facility Agreement, the Purchaser Parent and/or the Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain debt or equity financing in an aggregate
amount that is sufficient, when taken together with the Advance Receivables
Backed Notes, to pay the full amount of the Aggregate Consideration and
terminate the commitment of the Sellers under the Commitment Letter to provide
the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (the "Alternative Financing"). The
Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to
(i) negotiate and arrange the Alternative Financing, (ii) cooperate and assist
in the syndication or placement of the Alternative Financing, (iii) execute
and deliver all definitive documents relating to the Alternative Financing and

as the Purchaser may reasonably request in the syndication or placement of the
Alternative Financing.

  

  

(b) The Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing Alternative
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement if all conditions to the
Closing contained in Article VII are satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). In the event that
all or any portion of the Alternative Financing has not been obtained on or
prior to the Closing, then the Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser shall, no
later than the Closing, use their reasonable best efforts to (1) satisfy all
conditions to the Commitment Letter that are substantially within the control
or influence of the Purchaser, the Purchaser Parent or their representatives,
(2) satisfy all conditions to the Commitment Letter not substantially within
the control or influence of the Purchaser, the Purchaser or their
representatives (excluding the condition set forth in Section 2(A)(i) of the
Commitment Letter, for which no efforts are required), and (3) obtain such
other financing (on commercially reasonable terms and on terms consistent with
the terms of the Commitment Letter and the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility
Agreement) as may be needed to consummate the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that (i) the
provision, arrangement, purchase, placement or obtaining of the Alternative
Financing (by the Sellers or otherwise), and (ii) except as expressly set
forth in Sections 7.03(d) or (e), the disbursement of a loan under the Senior
Secured Term Loan Facility and the issuance of the ABS Notes are not
conditions to the Closing.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.06 shall be
deemed to require the Purchaser Parent to issue equity securities at a price
or on terms that are so adverse as to, in the reasonable judgment of the
Purchaser Parent's board of directors after consultation with an independent
investment banker of international standing and qualified outside counsel,
violate or conflict with the fiduciary duties of the Purchaser Parent's board
of directors under applicable Law.

SECTION 5.07. Sellers' Marks.

  

  

(a) As promptly as commercially practicable but in no event later than 90 days
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall completely and permanently
obliterate, mask or remove all Sellers' Marks from all Purchased Assets other
than any Sellers' Marks set forth on Assumed Contracts or other documents that
are not used for marketing or advertising purposes. On and after the Closing,
except as expressly otherwise set forth in this Section 5.07, the Purchaser
shall not (i) use any Sellers' Marks or any confusingly similar trade name,
corporate or business name, trademark, tag-line, identifying logo, trade
dress, monogram, slogan, service mark, domain name, brand name or other name
or source identifier or (ii) in any way represent that it is, or otherwise
holds itself out as being, affiliated with the Sellers or any Affiliate
thereof (except as the purchaser of the Purchased Assets). Except as expressly
otherwise set forth in this Section 5.07, the Purchaser shall not seek to
register in any jurisdiction any trade, corporate or business name, trademark,
tag-line, identifying logo, trade dress, monogram, slogan, service mark,
domain name, brand name or other name or source identifier that includes or is
a derivation, translation, adaptation, combination or variation of either of
the Sellers' Marks.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to applicable Law, for a period
of not more than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to use or disseminate, in ways that could not reasonably be
considered to disparage the Sellers, any invoices, purchase orders, sales
orders, labels, letterhead, envelopes, business cards, promotional materials
or other documentation used by the Sellers in connection with the Business and
existing on the Closing Date (the "Existing Stock") that bear any Sellers'
Mark where the removal, erasure, deletion or obliteration of such Sellers'
Mark on such Existing Stock would not be reasonably practicable, provided that
all use of the Sellers' Marks as set forth in this Section 5.07(b) shall be
consistent with past practice and only with respect to goods and services of a
level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services
with respect to which the Sellers used the Sellers' Marks immediately prior to
Closing. Except as set forth in this Section 5.07, the Purchaser shall not use
any Sellers' Marks together with its own or any other Trademarks on any
stationery or advertising or in any other form or documentation.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any
Affiliate of the Purchaser shall acquire any goodwill, rights or benefits
arising from its or their use of Sellers' Marks in accordance with Section
5.07(b) and that all such goodwill, rights and benefits shall accrue
absolutely to the applicable Seller.

  

  

SECTION 5.08. Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information; Tax Reporting.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms set forth in Section 5.02 of this Agreement, the Sellers,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall provide each
other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may
request of the other in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, (ii) determining a Liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of
Taxes, and (iii) participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding
in respect of Taxes, in each case, relating to the Purchased Assets or the
Business. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof in accordance with Section 5.02 and
timely notice to the other parties in writing of any pending or proposed
audits or assessments with respect to Taxes for which the other may have a
liability under this Agreement (including furnishing the other parties with
copies of all relevant correspondence received from any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such audits or assessments). The Sellers, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall make themselves (and their
respective employees) available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties
to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this
Section 5.08(a). Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to the Tax
matters relevant to the Purchased Assets or the Business for each taxable
period first ending after the Closing and for all prior taxable periods until
the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which
such Tax Returns and other documents relate (taking into account any extension
or waiver thereof). Any information obtained under this Section 5.08(a) shall
be kept confidential in accordance with Section 5.03, except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for
refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall make reasonable efforts to comply with
and shall adopt the "alternative procedure" of IRS Revenue Procedure 99-50 §
5, 1999-2 C.B. 757, for all reports, forms, notices and filings required by
the Code, Regulations and other federal law, regulations or administrative
procedures in connection with the Servicing and the Mortgage Loans eligible
for the "alternative procedure," where the Sellers shall be the "predecessors"
and the Purchaser shall be the "successor" as the terms are used in Revenue
Procedure 99-50 § 5, 1999-2 C.B. 757. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
extent the Sellers and the Purchaser comply with and adopt such "alternative
procedure," the Sellers shall timely provide to the Purchaser, accurately and
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, all information required by
the Purchaser to prepare and send to Mortgagors and prepare and file with the
IRS all reports, forms, notices and filings required by the Code, Regulations
and other federal law, regulations or administrative procedures in connection
with the Servicing and the Mortgage Loans with respect to events that occurred
at any time during the period commencing on January 1, 2010 and ending on the
Closing Date, and upon receipt of such information by the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall prepare and file such reports, forms, notice and filings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall be jointly and severally
responsible for all such reports, forms, notices and filings that must be made
on or before the Closing Date, or otherwise relate to such periods (or
portions thereof). The Sellers shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless
against Taxes imposed as a result of a failure of a Seller to provide
information as required by this Section 5.08(b) or to otherwise comply with
this Section 5.08(b) and all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Purchaser in
complying with this Section 5.08(b) allocable to matters relating to Pre-
Closing Periods. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless
against Taxes imposed as a result of a failure by the Purchaser to comply to
the extent required by this Section 5.08(b) with the requirements of the
"alternative procedure" of IRS Revenue Procedure 99-50 § 5, 1999-2 C.B. 757,
unless such failure results from the Sellers' failure to comply with their
obligations under this Section 5.08(b).

SECTION 5.09. Conveyance Taxes. The Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each be liable for 50% of any Conveyance
Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Purchaser, after the review and consent by the Sellers,
shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Conveyance
Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing in accordance with any
available pre-sale filing procedure. The Sellers shall execute and deliver all
instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Purchaser to comply with
the foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 5.10. Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as
may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Purchaser's sole cost and expense, the
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser, and shall provide the
Purchaser with such information as the Purchaser may reasonably request, to
transfer any Permits referred to in Section 2.01(a)(xv) to the Purchaser prior
to the Closing Date to the extent permitted by Law.

  

  

SECTION 5.11. Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges.

  

  

(a) Except as provided in Section 5.09 or otherwise in this Agreement, all
Property Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets for any Straddle Period,
whether imposed or assessed before or after the Closing Date, shall be
prorated between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of 12:01 A.M. on the day
after the Closing Date. If any Property Taxes subject to proration are paid by
the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand, the
proportionate amount of such Property Taxes paid (or in the event a refund of
any portion of such Property Taxes previously paid is received, such refund)
shall be paid promptly by (or to) the other after the payment of such Property
Taxes (or promptly following the receipt of any such refund). All Taxes (other
than Property Taxes) relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business or for
the Straddle Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional rent,
license fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to the
extent attributable to the Purchased Assets for any period in which the
Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Sellers shall not be
entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to any period from
and after the Closing Date and that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
that portion of any such installment applicable to any period prior to the
Closing Date, and if the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall
receive any such payments after the Closing Date, it shall promptly remit to
such other party its share of such payments.

  

  

(c) The prorations pursuant to this Section 5.11 may be calculated after the
Closing, as each item to be prorated (including any such Tax, obligation,
assessment, charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee or revenue)
accrues or comes due; provided, that, in any event, any such proration shall
be calculated not later than 30 days after the party requesting the proration
of any item obtains the information required to calculate such proration, and
the payment of any such proration shall be made no later than five days
following the completion of such calculation.

shall send the Mortgagors notification of the transfer of the Servicing
function, which shall comply in all material respects with all Applicable
Requirements, including the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, as
amended, and Regulation X, as amended. At least 16 days prior to the

in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser) to the
Mortgagors under the Mortgage Loans of the transfer of the applicable
Servicing and instruct the Mortgagors to deliver all Mortgage Loan Payments
and related payments and all tax and insurance notices to, or as directed by,
the Purchaser on and after the Closing Date. The Sellers and the Purchaser
each shall bear their own costs and expenses of preparing and delivering their
respective notices described in this Section 5.12(a).

  

  

(b) All Mortgage Loan Payments, other funds or payments used to pay bills that
relate to Mortgage Loans received by the Sellers after the Closing Date shall
be forwarded by the Sellers to the Purchaser within two Business Days after

Loan Payment shall be accompanied by an endorsement assigning such Mortgage
Loan Payment to the Purchaser. For 90 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall forward to the Purchaser all bills, transmittal lists and other
information within two Business Days after receipt and proper identification

develop a plan prior to the Closing Date (the "Conversion Plan") to effect the
orderly transfer of the Loan Files and Servicing files, the physical transfer
of Servicing, and the provision of customary notices to taxing authorities,
insurance providers, escrow arrangements and the like. Without limiting the
foregoing, such Conversion Plan shall provide that the Sellers shall notify
each relevant vendor of services of the transfer contemplated hereby, and the
Sellers shall bear the cost and expense of such notices. Each of the Purchaser
and the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon and
implement the Conversion Plan.

  

  

(b) Upon reasonable request by the Purchaser and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall prepare, execute and furnish
the Purchaser with such limited powers of attorney to execute documents on
behalf of the Sellers in respect of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and
such other documents prepared by the Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to the Sellers as may be necessary or appropriate to enable
the Purchaser to liquidate, collect payments against and otherwise service and
manage the Mortgage Loans, Mortgaged Properties and REO Properties in
accordance with the related Servicing Agreements.

with the Sellers to obtain the Consents on or prior to the Closing Date. If
any Consent is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date and the Sellers in

the Sellers to obtain such Consent; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,

adversely affects the rights of such party or imposes unreasonable burdens on
the business or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party.

from active employment and, if so, the date such absence commenced and the
anticipated date of return to active employment; (vii) the annual salary or
hourly wage, as the case may be, for the current fiscal year; (viii) the
earliest date as of which such Prospective Employee is next subject to a
performance evaluation or potential increase in compensation; and (ix) any
company-provided vehicles or vehicle allowances of each Prospective Employee.
Such lists shall be updated by the Sellers and delivered in writing to the
Purchaser prior to, and as of five (5) Business Days before, the Closing Date.
Immediately prior to the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Prospective
Employee who is on a short term disability leave, workers' compensation leave,
or other authorized leave of absence as of the Closing Date, immediately after
the date that such Prospective Employee is no longer on any such leave), the
Purchaser shall offer employment to each Prospective Employee who is employed
by the Sellers or their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date,
which offer shall be for employment at the same work location or a location
within 25 miles of the Prospective Employee's current work location and in a
comparable position to the position held by such Prospective Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and with a base salary and cash bonus
targets and participation in employee benefit plans as set forth in Section
6.01(b) below. Notwithstanding this Section 6.01(a), the Purchaser shall not
be required to offer employment to those Prospective Employees who are on
long-term disability leave immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any
Prospective Employee to whom an offer is made in accordance with the preceding
sentence is referred to herein as an "Offered Employee," and any Offered
Employee who has accepted such offer of employment and commences employment
with the Purchaser shall be referred to as a "Transferred Employee."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 81 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Purchaser hereby agrees that it shall provide the Transferred
Employees with (i) base salary on terms and conditions substantially
comparable to the base salary provided by the Sellers or their Affiliates to
such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
participation in cash incentive and other employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements (other than post-retirement welfare benefits) for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the cash incentive and other employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements provided by the Purchaser to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby agrees that it shall allow the Transferred
Employees to participate in the Purchaser's existing incentive compensation
plans for comparable job functions of the Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby
agrees that, on behalf of the Sellers, it shall provide each of the
Transferred Employees who is a participant in the annual bonus component of
the HomEq Servicing 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2010 Compensation
Plan"), with a 2010 cash bonus in an amount equal to the obligation accrued as
of the Closing Date under the 2010 Compensation Plan with respect to each such
Transferred Employee and as set forth on Section 6.01(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule ("2010 Bonuses"), which amounts shall be paid on the earlier of each
such Transferred Employee's date of involuntary termination of employment
without cause (as defined in the 2010 Compensation Plan) or January 15, 2011.
On or immediately following January 15, 2011, (i) the Purchaser shall deliver
notice to the Sellers of the total amount of 2010 Bonuses actually paid to the
Transferred Employees (such amount, the "Bonuses Paid Amount"), which notice
will be certified by an officer of the Purchaser and will include
documentation reasonably acceptable to the Sellers evidencing the Bonuses Paid
Amount, and (ii) if the total amount of 2010 Bonuses set forth in Section
6.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Estimated Bonus Amount") is greater
than the Bonuses Paid Amount, the Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Sellers
in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by the Sellers, the excess of the Estimated Bonus Amount over the
Bonuses Paid Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement shall (A) create any obligation on the part of the Purchaser
to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee for any period
following the Closing or (B) create any third-party beneficiary rights
respecting any employee of either Seller, including any Offered Employee. The
Sellers shall pay to each of the Transferred Employees who is a participant in
a component of the 2010 Compensation Plan that is not an annual component
(e.g., a component of such plan that provides for the payment of bonuses on a
weekly, monthly or quarterly basis) (i) all such bonus amounts earned under
the 2010 Compensation Plan with respect to completed performance periods and
(ii) all such bonus amounts for performance periods in which the Closing Date
occurs as though such performance periods were completed and the maximum bonus
accrued as of the Closing Date but subject to proration based on the number of
days in the performance period completed as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plans of the Purchaser in which the
Transferred Employees participate after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall,
or shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance providers to:
(i) waive any limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any such plan in which such
Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall waive any such limitations only to
the extent that each Transferred Employee (and his/her dependents and
beneficiaries, as applicable) provides appropriate written consent for
disclosure of such information to the insurers or administrators of the
Purchaser's applicable Employee Benefit Plans as is necessary for the
Purchaser to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.01(c); and provided,
further, that no such waiver shall apply to a pre-existing condition of any
Transferred Employee or any dependent thereof, who was, immediately prior to
the Closing Date, excluded from participation in any Plan by nature of such
pre-existing condition; and (ii) recognize all service of the Transferred
Employees with either of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan and
for determining post retirement welfare benefits) in any benefit plan, program
or arrangement (including severance) in which such Transferred Employees may
be eligible to participate on or after the Closing, except to the extent such
treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 82 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Except to the extent included in the Assumed Liabilities and except as
otherwise provided in Section 6.01(e) below, (i) the Sellers or their
Affiliates shall be responsible for paying to Offered Employees and
Transferred Employees any accrued but unpaid wages or other compensation
(including earned, unused vacation, sick days (if applicable), payment upon
termination in lieu of notice, severance and change in control payments) upon
their termination of employment with the applicable Seller or its Affiliate
and in accordance with such Seller's or its Affiliate's policies and/or
contracts, in each case to the extent accrued on or before the Closing Date,
and (ii) the Purchaser shall have no responsibility or Liability for payment
of any wages or other compensation (including vacation or sick days) earned by
or owed to an Offered Employee (including an Offered Employee who rejects the
Purchaser's offer of employment made in accordance with Section 6.01(a) above
or who is not actively at work on the Closing Date and does not become a
Transferred Employee on the Closing Date), Transferred Employee or any other
employee impacted by this Agreement during his employment with the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates. In addition, the Sellers and their Affiliates
agree to retain, bear and discharge all Liabilities with respect to Offered
Employees (including the Transferred Employees) for workers' compensation
claims that are incurred on or before the Closing Date. A workers'
compensation claim shall be considered incurred on or before the Closing Date
if the occurrence of the accident or injury that gives rise to the claim
occurs on or before the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if any
Transferred Employee's workers' compensation claim is based on the occurrence
of an accident or injury that occurs on or before the Closing Date but is
aggravated as a result of services provided by the Transferred Employee to the
Purchaser or by further injury or accident, in each case, after the Closing
Date, Sellers and their Affiliates shall retain, bear and discharge the
Liabilities for such workers' compensation claim only to the extent such
Liabilities relate to the accident or injury that occurred on or before the
Closing Date.

  

  

(e) For a period of one year from the Closing Date (the "Severance Period"),
in the event of an involuntary termination of employment of any of the
Transferred Employees by the Purchaser (each such employee a "Severed
Transferred Employee" and collectively, the "Severed Transferred Employees"),
the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide the severance pay to such
Severed Transferred Employees as set forth on Section 6.01(e)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule and contingent on each such Severed Transferred Employee's
execution and non-revocation of a release and waiver of claims in favor of the
Purchaser, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates. Section 6.01(e)(i) of
the Disclosure Schedule shall set forth for each Transferred Employee the
amounts of severance pay that each such Transferred Employee will be eligible
to receive in the event of termination during each of the 12 months
immediately following the Closing Date. The aggregate severance pay paid by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.01(e) and in accordance with Section
6.01(e)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule is hereinafter referred to as the
"Severance Paid." As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the one-
year period following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver notice to
the Sellers of the total amount of Severance Paid, which notice will be
certified by an officer of the Purchaser. If the Purchaser Severance Amount is
greater than the Severance Paid, then the Purchaser shall promptly pay to the
Sellers the excess amount of the Purchaser Severance Amount over the Severance
Paid. If the Purchaser Severance Amount is less than the Severance Paid, then
the Sellers shall promptly pay to the Purchaser the excess amount of the
Severance Paid over the Purchaser Severance Amount. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Purchaser Severance Amount" shall mean the amount set forth on
Section 6.01(e)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 83 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The Purchaser shall be responsible for any obligation with respect to the
Transferred Employees under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification
Act of 1988 and any applicable state or local equivalent arising or accruing
after the Closing Date (collectively, "WARN"). The Sellers and their
Affiliates shall be responsible for any such obligation arising or accruing on
or before the Closing Date. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good
faith to determine whether any notification may be required under WARN as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(g) As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, but in
no event more than 90 days after the Closing Date, a defined contribution plan
(qualified under Section 401 of the Code) of the Purchaser shall accept direct
or indirect rollovers by Transferred Employees of their vested interests in
the Sellers' 401(k) Plan.

  

  

(h) With respect to each Transferred Employee, the Sellers and their
Affiliates shall provide the Purchaser with electronically generated data
extractions from the Sellers' and their Affiliates human resources systems, in
an agreed format, of such Transferred Employee's job description, employment
and job data, job code, current compensation, payroll data, date of hire,
current position, biographical information (which shall consist of name,
address, telephone, cell phone and e-mail contact information), I-9s, and such
additional information relating to the Purchaser's management or
administration of its relationship with the Transferred Employee as the
Purchaser and the Sellers may agree to in good faith; provided, that neither
the Sellers nor their Affiliates shall have obligations to transfer any
information or documents pursuant to this Section 6.01(h) to the extent such
transfer would be restricted or prohibited by Law. The foregoing information
shall be provided on the Closing Date (with the exception of the I-9s which
shall be provided as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter), as well as on
a preliminary basis for each Prospective Employee within seven days after the
date hereof (with such preliminary information to be updated on a monthly
basis until the Closing Date). The Purchaser shall implement and maintain
reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the
information provided by the Sellers and their Affiliates under this provision
to protect any personal information from unauthorized access, destruction,
use, modification or disclosure.

(including reasonable attorneys' fees) actually suffered or incurred by them,
including any Litigation brought or otherwise initiated by any of them
(collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or resulting from:

  

  

(a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers contained

interpreted without giving effect to any such limitations or qualifications as

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02 for any Losses arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with any claim that any Servicing Agreement
was transferred to the Purchaser in breach of the terms of such Servicing
Agreement to the extent (A) such claim arises out of, relates to or results
from the Purchaser's failure to satisfy the criteria under such Servicing
Agreement to be an eligible Servicer to the extent such eligibility criteria
is reflected in Section 4.06 or (B) the Purchaser waives or is deemed to waive
the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(e) or Section 7.01(f) with respect to
such Servicing Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.03. Indemnification by the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parent. The
Sellers and their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parent (on a
joint and several basis) from and against any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from:

  

  

(a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that such
representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to

therein);

  

  

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser or the Purchaser

Section 8.03(e) shall be deemed to contravene the Purchaser's rights pursuant
to Section 8.02).

  

  

SECTION 8.04. Limits on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy.

  

  

(a) Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.01,
3.02(a), (b) and (c) (but only as clause (c) relates to the Servicing
Agreements and the Underlying Documents), 3.03, 3.04(a), 3.05, 3.21, 3.22 and
3.23(a), the Sellers shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party
for any Losses pursuant to Section 8.02(a) (certain representations and
warranties), unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses and any
Servicing Agreement Rep Losses (as defined below) incurred by all Purchaser
Indemnified Parties exceeds an amount equal to 1.75% of the Indemnity Purchase
Price (the "General Deductible Amount"), and then only for such Losses
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties which exceed the General
Deductible Amount, and in no event shall the aggregate maximum amount
recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any and all claims
pursuant to Section 8.02(a) (other than for breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02(a), (b) and (c) (but only clause (c)
as relates to the Servicing Agreements and the Underlying Documents), 3.03,
3.04(a), 3.05) exceed an amount equal to 30% of the Indemnity Purchase Price.
The Sellers shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any
Losses pursuant to Section 8.02(a) for any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.21 and 3.22 (collectively, "Servicing
Agreement Rep Losses") unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Servicing Agreement Rep Losses incurred by all Purchaser Indemnified Parties
exceeds an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the "Servicing Agreement Rep Deductible
Amount"), and then only for such Servicing Agreement Rep Losses incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties which exceed the Servicing Agreement Rep
Deductible Amount; provided, however, that none of the foregoing limitations
shall apply to any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.21 and 3.22 to the extent that the breach of any such
representation or warranty proximately caused the termination of the
applicable Servicing Agreement by the counterparty thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, if the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have actually
suffered or incurred an aggregate amount of Losses pursuant to Section 8.02(a)
in excess of the General Deductible Amount, subject to the proviso in the
foregoing sentence, any Servicing Agreement Rep Losses actually suffered or
incurred shall be subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a)
without regard to the Servicing Agreement Rep Deductible Amount.

(b) Subject to Section 10.12 and except as otherwise provided in Sections
2.09, 2.10 and 5.18, and other than with respect to Sections 5.02, 5.03 and
5.07 for which specific performance shall be expressly permitted in accordance
with Section 10.12, if the Closing occurs, the indemnity provisions of this
Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties
with respect to any and all claims for Losses sustained, incurred or suffered
to the extent directly or indirectly relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, and each of the Purchaser (on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties) and the Parent (on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties) waives
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law any and all rights,
claims and causes of legal action to pursue any other remedies against the
other party hereto or its Affiliates, except for fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, now or in the future under any Law.

  

  

SECTION 8.05. Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party
(a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no
event more than 10 days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a Third
Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party
Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the
extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such Third Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any
relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any
other material details pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice"); provided,
however, that the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall not affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such failure has materially
prejudiced the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30
days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be
required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt
of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 90 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.05(a), the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defense at its expense, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 8.05(b). Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel
of its choosing at its expense. If the Indemnified Party elects to participate
in any such defense and to employ separate counsel, the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred
by the Indemnified Party in defending any such Third Party Claim (including
reasonable legal fees of the Indemnified Party's separate counsel) but only if
(i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to
the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential conflict of interests, or (ii) the Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has
failed to diligently pursue a Third Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in
the first sentence of Section 8.05(c). The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise
or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would
result in (A) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the business of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, or (C) except to the extent (i) within the
Servicing Agreement Rep Deductible Amount with respect to Servicing Agreement
Rep Losses or (ii) within the General Deductible Amount with respect to other
Losses, any monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be
promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, or (ii) after assuming
the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary
to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten days after receiving
written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying
Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the
obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood that the Indemnified
Party's right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be
adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including by
providing access to each other's relevant business records and other
documents, and employees, subject to Section 5.03; it being understood that
the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be
considered as Losses.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 91 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

  

  

SECTION 8.06. Tax Treatment. The Sellers and the Purchaser and Purchaser
Parent agree that all payments made by any of them to or for the benefit of
the other under this Article VIII, under other indemnity provisions of this
Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or
covenants, shall be treated as adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration for
Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except
to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise.

  

  

SECTION 8.07. Consequential and Other Special Damages. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be
liable under this Article VIII for any consequential, punitive, special,
incidental or indirect damages, including lost profits, except to the extent
awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with a Third Party
Claim.

  

  

SECTION 8.08. Adjustments to Losses for Insurance. In calculating the amount
of any Losses, the proceeds actually received by an Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person in each case
relating to any Third Party Claim or any direct indemnity claim, net of any
actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing or
obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted, except to the extent that the
adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part
of such Losses.

  

  

SECTION 8.09. No Duplication. No Loss will be given duplicative effect for
purposes of indemnification under this Article VIII, and no party shall be
entitled to indemnity for any Loss pursuant to any provision of this Article
VIII in duplication of indemnity for the same Loss pursuant to any other
provision of this Article VIII. This Section 8.09 shall in no event affect the
Purchaser's right to pursue recovery for Losses pursuant to any particular
provision of Section 8.02.

  

  

SECTION 8.10. Mitigation. For all purposes of this Agreement, including with
respect to Section 2.09, Section 2.10, Section 5.18 and this Article VIII,
each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any indemnifiable Losses or any repayment obligations set forth
herein.

TERMINATION

  

  

SECTION 9.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by either the Parent or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred by October 2, 2010 (the "Termination Date"); provided that (i) if the
Audited Carve-Out Financials have not been delivered to the Purchaser on or
prior to August 15, 2010, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended
(without any action by any of the parties being necessary) to the earlier of
(A) December 2, 2010 and (B) the second Business Day of the first month
following the date that is 45 days after the date on which the Audited Carve-
Out Financials have been delivered to the Purchaser; and/or (ii) (A) if the
Purchaser does not have Financing by October 1, 2010 and, as of October 1,
2010, the Purchaser has complied in all material respects with Section 5.06,
then the Termination Date shall automatically be extended (without any action
by any of the parties being necessary) to November 2, 2010, and (B) if the
Purchaser does not have Financing by November 1, 2010 and, as of November 1,
2010, the Purchaser has complied in all material respects with Section 5.06,
then the Termination Date shall automatically be extended (without any action
by any of the parties being necessary) to December 2, 2010 (it being
understood and agreed that in the event that the conditions to any automatic
extension of the Termination Date are met such that the Termination Date is
automatically extended one or more times pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
this Section 9.01(a), the latest "Termination Date" under such clauses shall
be deemed the "Termination Date" for all purposes of this Agreement);
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.01(a) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date;

  

  

(b) by either the Parent or the Purchaser in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
Action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable;

  

  

(c) by the mutual written consent of the Parent and the Purchaser; or

  

  

(d) by the Purchaser in the event that a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

  

  

SECTION 9.02. Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) If (i) all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth
in Article VII (excluding for this purpose the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.03(d) and (e)) shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
provided that such conditions shall have been capable of being satisfied as of
the date of termination of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) except to the extent waived by the Sellers in accordance
with this Agreement, the covenants and agreements contained in Section 5.06
shall have been complied with by the Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Parent, as
the case may be, in all material respects as of the Termination Date, (iii)
the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Termination Date due to the
fact that the Purchaser does not have sufficient Financing, and (iv) the
Purchaser or the Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(a),
then the Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Parent shall pay to the Sellers an
amount equal to the Termination Fee, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account designated by the Parent no later than two
Business Days after such termination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 93 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Sellers agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event the Termination Fee becomes payable and is actually
paid by the Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Parent to the Sellers, in each case
in accordance with the terms of and for the reasons set forth in Section
9.02(a), (1) the receipt of such Termination Fee by the Sellers shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy (other than with respect to any costs and expenses
that are payable to the Sellers in the event that the Sellers prevail in a
suit commenced in accordance with Section 9.02(c)) of the Sellers, their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns against the Purchaser, the Purchaser Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates or their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns for, and in no event shall the
Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns seek to recover any other money damages or seek
any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity or otherwise with respect
to, (A) any Loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement to be consummated, (B) the termination of
this Agreement, (C) any Liabilities arising under this Agreement or (D) any
Litigation arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of
or under this Agreement, in each case (A), (B), (C) or (D), except with
respect to the matters contemplated by clause (a) of Section 9.03 which
survive the termination of this Agreement, and (2) other than with respect to
any costs and expenses that are payable to the Sellers in the event that the
Sellers prevail in a suit commenced in accordance with Section 9.02(c), the
Sellers hereby expressly waive any and all other rights or causes of action it
or its Affiliates may have against the Purchaser or its Affiliates now or in
the future under any Law with respect to (A) any Loss suffered as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement to be
consummated, (B) the termination of this Agreement, (C) any Liabilities
arising under this Agreement or (D) any Litigation arising out of or relating
to any breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement, in each case
(A), (B), (C) or (D), except with respect to the matters contemplated by
clause (a) of Section 9.03 which survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Purchaser and the Purchaser
Parent fail to promptly pay the amount due to the Sellers pursuant to Section
9.02(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Sellers commence a suit
that results in a judgment against the Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Parent
for the amount of the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then the
Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Parent shall pay to the Sellers their costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest payable at the Federal Funds Rate (as in effect on the date that
the Termination Fee was required to be paid to the Sellers pursuant to Section
9.02(a)) on the amount awarded to the Sellers in such suit accruing from the
date that the Termination Fee or portion thereof was required to be paid to
the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.02(a) through the date that such amount and
all of the Sellers' costs and expenses are paid in full by the Purchaser
and/or the Purchaser Parent; provided, however, that if the court in any such
suit finds that the Sellers are not entitled to payment by the Purchaser
and/or the Purchaser Parent of the Termination Fee or any portion thereof
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Sellers shall reimburse the
Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Parent, as the case may be, for their costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in defending such suit.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 94 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.03. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no Liability on the part of either party hereto except
(a) as set forth in Sections 5.03, 5.14, 5.21, 9.02, 10.01, 10.04, 10.05,
10.06, 10.07, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.14 and 10.15 and (b) that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from Liability for any breach of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.03. Public Announcements. None of the parties hereto shall make, or
cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or otherwise communicate with any news media in respect
thereof without the prior written consent of the other parties (unless
otherwise required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable Self-
Regulatory Organization), and the parties hereto shall cooperate as to the
form, timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement or
communication.

  

  

SECTION 10.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 10.05. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and,
subject to Section 5.03(c), the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between the Sellers and the Purchaser with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

SECTION 10.06. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
Law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Sellers and the
Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of
the Sellers or the Purchaser) and any such assignment or attempted assignment
without such consent shall be void; provided, however, that any party may
assign this Agreement or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or
more Affiliates of such party without the consent of the other parties; and
provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve the assignor of any
of its obligations hereunder.

  

  

SECTION 10.07. Amendment. This Agreement may only be amended or modified by an
instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Sellers and the
Purchaser.

  

  

SECTION 10.08. Waiver. Either the Purchaser or the Sellers may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or
agreements of the other party or conditions to such party's obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any
waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either
party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of any of such rights. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 97 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 10.09. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions of
Article VIII relating to the Indemnified Parties, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person, including any
union or any employee or former employee of the Sellers, any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 10.10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All Litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
of The City of New York; provided, however, that if such federal court does
not have jurisdiction over any such Litigation, such Litigation shall be heard
and determined exclusively in any New York State court sitting in the Borough
of Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence,
the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New
York for the purpose of any Litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not
to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Litigation, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

  

 

  

SECTION 10.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.11.

 

  

  

SECTION 10.12. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the Closing, the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York (if
such federal court does not have jurisdiction over any such Litigation, such
Litigation shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York State
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a valid termination in accordance
with Section 9.01 and the payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 9.02, the Sellers, in accordance with Section 9.02, shall not be
entitled to any injunction or injunctions or to enforce specifically any term
or provision of this Agreement, except with respect to the matters
contemplated by Section 9.03(a) which survive the termination of this
Agreement. If the Closing occurs, this provision shall be subject to Section
8.04(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 98 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 10.13. Currency. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

  

  

SECTION 10.14. Joint Drafting. Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser has
cooperated and participated equally in the drafting of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. In the event any construction of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements is required, each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
be deemed to have been mutually prepared by the Sellers and the Purchaser and
shall not be construed against any of them solely by reason of authorship.
