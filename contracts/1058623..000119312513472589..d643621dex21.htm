provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into the

in the Merger.

 

B. The parties desire to make or enter into certain representations,
warranties and covenants in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

C. Terms not otherwise defined in the text shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in Article X hereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of
the mutual representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company at
the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and will succeed to and assume
all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger will take
place at the offices of Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree Street, N.E., Suite 800,
Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 10:00 a.m. local time on the third Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waiver of those conditions at Closing), or at such other place, time and
date as may be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_." Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Parent will cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger or other appropriate documents (collectively, the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger
will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company
will agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4  _Effects_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.5  _Conversion of Securities_.

(a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of the Company Capital Stock, (i) each share of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Dissenting Shares and any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
1.5(b)_) will be converted automatically into the right to receive, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Common Stock Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest, payable in the manner set forth in _Section
1.10_, and (ii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and any
shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
1.5(b)_) will be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Series A Preferred Stock Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest, payable in the manner set forth in _Section
1.10_. From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, and, upon the conversion thereof, shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist. Except as set forth in  _Section
1.5(b)_, as a result of the Merger, each holder of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (" _Certificates_ ") and each holder of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are not represented
by Certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration, without interest, in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section
1.10(a)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, 
_Section 1.10(f)_).

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each Share held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub, par value $.01 per share, will be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation, par

 



\- 2 -  value $.01 per share, and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
the common stock of Merger Sub shall, without the necessity of presenting the
same for exchange, be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

Section 1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the Companys certificate
of incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") will be amended and restated in
its entirety to read as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub (the "
_Merger Sub Charter_ ") as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall remain as the name of
the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended
and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the Companys bylaws as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (the " _Company Bylaws_ ")
will be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of
Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ ") as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall remain
as the name of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
as so amended and restated will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter amended as provided therein, in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law

Section 1.7 _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

 

Section 1.8 _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
as the case may be.

 

Section 1.9 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the exchange of Shares in accordance
with this _Article I_. As of the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the
Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration
in exchange for the Shares, other than Dissenting Shares, __less__ the Escrow
Amount (such cash amount so made available to the Exchange Agent the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Exchange Fund will

 



\- 3 -  be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent _; provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such investments shall be in (i) securities issued or
directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the United States government or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and having maturities of not more than
one month from the date of investment or (ii) money market mutual or similar
funds having assets in excess of $1,000,000,000. Any interest or other income
from such investments will be paid to and become income of Parent. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent
from making the payments required by this _Article I_ , and following any
losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares at the
Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will
be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

(b) _Escrow Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as an agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. As of the Effective Time, Parent will deposit the Escrow
Amount into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be maintained by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Fund will be disbursed to or on behalf of Parent or the Principal Stockholders
in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If requested by
the Company prior to Closing, or by the Principal Stockholders Representative
after Closing, the Escrow Fund may be replaced by a transaction and litigation
liability insurance policy providing insurance with no less protection and
security, and on the same or more favorable terms, as comprising the Escrow
Fund, and otherwise satisfactory to Parent, in Parents sole discretion, the
premiums of which shall be a Transaction Expense if obtained prior to
Closing, or at the sole expense of the Principal Stockholders Representative
if obtained after Closing. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent
retains, and has bargained for through arms length negotiation with the
Company, the sole and absolute discretion to determine whether such
transaction and litigation liability insurance policy is satisfactory. In
making such determination, the Company acknowledges and agrees that Parents
sole and absolute discretion shall not be limited or otherwise constrained by
any express or implied contractual duty or covenant (including the covenant
of good faith and fair dealing) and that such duty or covenant shall not form
in any manner whatsoever the basis of any Liability of Parent, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise. The Company hereby waives its rights, if any,
under any such duty or covenant and hereby agrees not to initiate any Action
at law or in equity (whether for injunction or specific performance under
_Section 9.6_ or otherwise) arising out of or related to such duty or
covenant in connection with the exercise of Parents sole and absolute
discretion under this _Section 1.9(b)_. The Company acknowledges and agrees
that Parent shall be under no obligation (i) to consider the interests of, or
any actual or potential consequences or impact to, the Company, its
Affiliates, its stockholders, including the Principal Stockholders, or any
other Person, or (ii) to consult with, or seek guidance or approval from,
the Company, its Affiliates, its stockholders, including the Principal
Stockholders, or any other Person, in each case, in connection with the
exercise of Parents sole and absolute discretion under this _Section
1.9(b)_.

 



\- 4 - Section 1.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_: (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which may include a provision confirming that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such holders Certificates and Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares will be effected in accordance
with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities
represented by book entry.

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange
Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal in the
form described in _Section 1.10(a)(i)_ and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, (A) the holder of such Shares will
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings) of (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, __multiplied by__ (y)
the Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred
Stock Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, __less__ , in the case of
the Principal Stockholders, each such Principal Stockholders Pro Rata Share
of the Escrow Amount and (B) the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
_Section 1.5(a)_ and this  _Section 1.10(a)(ii)_, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share will be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender, in each case, without interest,
the applicable Merger Consideration.

(b) _No Further Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All Merger Consideration
issued or paid upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ will be deemed to have
been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (including any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred
Stock, whether or not declared).

(c)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares on the date that is six months after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ will thereafter look only to
Parent for the applicable Merger Consideration to which they are entitled
pursuant to  _Section 1.5(a)_.

(d) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund or other cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules or regulations 

 



\- 5 -  promulgated thereunder, any provision of applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts will be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent of
any such Person who is not an institutional investor or an Affiliate thereof,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.5(a)_.

Section 1.11 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed and there will be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason will be cancelled and exchanged for
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_.

 

Section 1.12 _Company Equity Rights_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Equity Right that is a stock option shall cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of Company Capital Stock and shall be cancelled and
terminated without payment. In order to effect such cancellation and
termination, the Company shall provide each holder of a Company Equity Right
that is a stock option with a notice of termination in accordance with any
terms of the plan pursuant to which such Company Equity Right was granted.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the 7.5% Warrant will be contributed
to the Company pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and terminated in
exchange for the right to receive the Warrant Cash Out Amount.

Section 1.13  _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and are held by a stockholder (each, a " _Dissenting
Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to exercise, and properly exercises,
dissenters rights with respect to such shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into or exchangeable for
or represent the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration (except
as provided in this _Section 1.13_) and will entitle such Dissenting
Stockholder only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as
may be determined to be due to the holder of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting
Stockholder withdraws (in accordance with the DGCL) or effectively loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal. If any
Dissenting Stockholder will have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with the
DGCL) or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right
to appraisal, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder

 



\- 6 -  will be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article I_ , less applicable withholding taxes, if any,
required to be withheld. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares

for the operation and conduct of, or otherwise material to, the businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as now conducted, or as conducted since
January 1, 2012 or as currently contemplated by the Company to be conducted.
There are no outstanding adverse Governmental Orders to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject with respect to any Owned Intellectual
Property or, to the Companys Knowledge, Licensed Intellectual Property. Since

any written communication alleging that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has infringed or, by conducting the Radio Network
Businesses, would infringe the Intellectual Property rights of any Person.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will infringe the
Intellectual Property rights of any Person, impair the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any of the Owned Intellectual Property
or material Licensed Intellectual Property, or, except as set forth in
_Section 3.11_ of Company Disclosure Letter, require the Consent of any other
Person in respect thereof. The conduct of the Company and its Subsidiaries
businesses as currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise conflict with the Intellectual Property rights of any Person. To the
Companys Knowledge, since January 1, 2012, except as set forth in _Section
3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there has been no unauthorized use,
infringement or misappropriation of the Owned Intellectual Property or
Licensed Intellectual Property by any Person (including the Companys and its
Subsidiaries employees, former employees and contract workers). All of the
Owned Intellectual Property is valid and subsisting. There is no claim or
demand of any Person asserted in any proceeding that is pending or to the
Companys Knowledge threatened against the Company or its Subsidiaries that
challenges the rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of any of
the Owned Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property. The Company
and its Subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, obtain proper and
effective assignments or licenses or grants of authority to use, in each case
in favor of the Company and its Subsidiaries, any and all Intellectual
Property material to the Companys or its Subsidiaries Radio Network
Businesses that employees or consultants employed or engaged by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, have created or developed
as part of such employment or engagement. Immediately subsequent to the
Closing, the Owned Intellectual Property will be owned, and, subject to
the receipt of all applicable third party Consents set forth on _Section
3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the material Licensed Intellectual
Property will be available for use by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or

or trigger any other obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, or
(iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

as not to unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (ii) would not jeopardize any attorney-client privilege,
as determined in good faith by the Company, and (iii) would not violate, and

disparaging to the Transactions or the parties hereto, their Subsidiaries,
their stockholders or any of their affiliates or which is disparaging to their
respective former or current officers, directors, employees, advisors,

Company or any Subsidiary is, on the Closing Date, either (i) providing such
continuation health care coverage, or (ii) under an obligation to provide such
continuation health care coverage at the election of the employee or the
qualified beneficiary.

repeal or otherwise modify the indemnification provisions of the certificate

insurance (the " _Company Current Insurance_ ") with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
Transactions contemplated hereby), or (ii) purchase a six year extended

placed through such broker(s) and with such insurance carriers as may be
specified by the Company and as are reasonably acceptable to Parent.

purposes of any "tail" by reference to 1/6th the aggregate premium paid
therefor) amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the first and
second sentences of this _Section 5.8(c)_, but subject to the third sentence
of this _Section 5.8(c)_, the Company shall be permitted at its sole and
exclusive option to purchase a Company Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the
Effective Time.

Officer or President of Parent, dated the Closing Date, on behalf of Parent,

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. Except with respect to provisions that expressly
survive the termination of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to Closing (the date of any such termination, the "
_Termination Date_ "):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling, or
taken any other action, restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Closing of the Transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or prior to 12 months after the date hereof; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to
such date was primarily due to the breach of such partys representations or
warranties or the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that for so long as the
Townsquare APA shall not have been terminated (and the Townsquare Transaction
shall have not closed), the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to Parent if each of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing and other than _Section 6.2(f)_) have been satisfied
or waived;

 

(d) by the Company if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which if uncured would cause any condition set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being
cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
twenty Business Days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such
breach from the Company; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if the
Company is then in material breach of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein and such breach would give rise to
the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ to be
satisfied;

 

(e) by Parent if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which if uncured would cause any condition set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being
cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
twenty Business Days following receipt by the Company of written notice of
such breach from Parent; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ if Parent is then
in material breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein and such breach would give rise to the failure of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ to be satisfied; or

 



\- 38 - (f) by Parent or the Company, if the Principal Stockholders have not delivered
the Written Consent within one day after the date hereof.

Section 7.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, if the Merger is not consummated, the fees and expenses
incurred by each party in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the documents and instruments
contemplated hereby and in connection with the Transactions contemplated
hereby, including all fees and disbursements of advisors retained by any party
shall be the sole responsibility of such incurring and retaining party.

 

Section 7.3 _Procedures and Effect of Termination_. Any termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1_ (other than pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)_) shall be
effected by written notice from the terminating party to the other parties. If
this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, this Agreement (other than
_Section 5.3_, _Section 7.2_, this  _Section 7.3_, _Article IX_ and
_Article X_ ) shall forthwith become void and of no further force and effect,
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective officers,
directors, direct or indirect stockholders or partners or Affiliates (except
for the obligations of the parties contained in _Section 5.3_, and in
_Section 7.2_); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.3_
shall be deemed to release any party from any liability arising prior to
termination for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. Each partys right of termination under _Section 7.1_ is in
addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise,
the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies,
and the terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive
any such termination unimpaired.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenant_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time until, and shall terminate on, the
date that is 12 months following the Closing Date (the " _General
Expiration Date_ ") (subject to the tolling and other provisions and
exceptions set forth in _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_; provided, however,
that this _Section 8.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) After the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the _Parent Indemnified Parties_
") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Principal Stockholders for
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including attorneys
fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred by one of more of the Parent
Indemnified Parties (hereinafter, a " _Loss_ "), arising out of or resulting
from: (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement; (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by the

 



\- 39 -  Company in this Agreement; (iii) the matters set forth on _Schedule
8.2(a)(iii)_ ; (iv) any errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the Merger
Consideration Schedule, and (v) the matters set forth on _Schedule
8.2(a)(v)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

(i) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnity for
indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable under  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other
than with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_ and _3.18_ ) unless and until the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses exceeds an amount equal to $1 million (the " _Basket
Amount_ "), at which point the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification from and against such aggregate Losses in excess of the Basket
Amount;

 

(ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be limited to the amount of the Escrow Fund
and each Principal Stockholders maximum indemnity obligation shall be limited
to such Principal Stockholders interest in the Escrow Fund;

 

(iii) in calculating the amount of Losses recoverable pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_, the amount of such Losses shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds
actually received relating to such Losses, net of any related deductible and
expenses actually and reasonably incurred to obtain such proceeds. In the
event an indemnification payment is received by any Parent Indemnified Party
in respect of any Losses, and such Parent Indemnified Party later receives any
such net insurance proceeds, Parent shall promptly, and in any event no later
than ten business days following such receipt, pay to the
Principal Stockholders Representative the lesser of such net amount or the
amount of such indemnification payment previously received by the Parent
Indemnified Party.

 

(c) After the Closing, the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parent Indemnified Parties for indemnifiable Loss arising under the
Agreement and no Principal Stockholder shall have any liability to any of the
Parent Indemnified Parties except through such Principal Stockholders
interest in the Escrow Fund.

 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation agree
that following Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy and recourse against
any stockholder of the Company with respect to any and all claims relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this 
_Article VIII_ , except in the case of fraud by the Company. In furtherance of
the foregoing, but without limiting the rights of indemnification expressly
provided for under this _Article VIII_ , each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation hereby waives (on behalf of itself and on behalf of the
Parent Indemnified Parties), from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law any and all rights, claims and causes of action
(including any right, whether arising at Law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or
remedy and remedies that may arise under common law) that such Parent
Indemnified Party may have against any stockholder of the Company (including
any Principal Stockholder) whether arising under or based upon any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise, except in the case of fraud by the Company.

 



\- 40 - Section 8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) The Parent Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") to the Principal Stockholders Representative and to the Escrow
Agent of any claim or event known to it which gives rise or, in its reasonable
good faith judgment, may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder by
such Parent Indemnified Party against the Principal Stockholders from whom
they are entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ ; _provided_ ,
that the failure of any Parent Indemnified Party to give a Claim Notice as
provided in this _Section 8.3(a)_ shall not relieve the Principal
Stockholders of their obligations under this _Article VIII_ , except to the
extent that such failure has materially and adversely affected the rights of
the Principal Stockholders. Any Claim Notice in respect of a claim
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_,
_Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ or _Section 8.2(v)_ must be given prior to the General
Expiration Date, and any claim for indemnification pursuant to  _Section
8.2(a)(iii)_ must be given prior to the date that is 18 months following the
Closing Date (the " _Litigation Expiration Date_ "), and shall only be in
respect of Losses actually incurred prior to the Litigation Expiration Date.

(b) The obligations and liabilities of the Principal Stockholders under this
_Article VIII_ with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this _Article VIII_
(" _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by and contingent upon the
following additional terms and conditions: 

(i) If a Parent Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party
Claim (other than the matters described in  _Schedule 8.2(a)(iii)_ , the
Parent Indemnified Party shall give the Principal Stockholders Representative
a Claim Notice describing such Third Party Claim within 60 days of the receipt
by the Parent Indemnified Party of such notice;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to provide such Claim Notice shall not release the Principal
Stockholders from any of their obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to
the extent that such Principal Stockholders are materially prejudiced by such
failure.

(ii) The Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to
the Parent Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and
the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom.

 

(iii) The Principal Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to assume
and control the defense of such Third Party Claim (other than the matters
described in _Schedule 8.2(a)(iii)_ ) at its expense (in which case the
Principal Stockholders shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties
for legal expense subsequently incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof) and through counsel of its choice if it
gives notice of its intention to do so to the Parent Indemnified Party within
ten Business Days of the receipt of such Claim Notice from the Parent
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if there exists or is reasonably
likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the
judgment of the Parent

 



\- 41 -  Indemnified Party, in its reasonable discretion, for the same counsel to
represent both the Parent Indemnified Party and the Principal Stockholders
Representative, then the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain
its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the Parent Indemnified Party
determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Principal Stockholders
Representative. In the event that the Principal Stockholders Representative
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party
Claim as provided above, the Parent Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Principal Stockholders Representative in such defense and make available to
the Principal Stockholders Representative, at the Principal Stockholders
Representatives expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Parent Indemnified Partys possession or under the Parent
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Principal Stockholders Representative. Similarly, in the event the Parent
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any such Third Party Claim, the Principal Stockholders Representative shall
cooperate with the Parent Indemnified Party in such defense and make available
to the Parent Indemnified Party, at the Principal
Stockholders Representatives expense, all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Principal Stockholders Representatives
possession or under the Principal Stockholders Representatives control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Parent Indemnified Party.
No such Third Party Claim may be settled by any party conducting the defense
against such claim without the prior written consent of the other party.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall have the sole
right to defend and settle, in its discretion, the matters described on
_Schedule 8.2(a)(iii)_.

 

Section 8.4 _Principal Stockholders  Representative_.

 

(a) The Principal Stockholders Representative shall be irrevocably nominated
and appointed by the Principal Stockholders to represent the Principal
Stockholders, as their agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of such Principal
Stockholder with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to
take any and all actions and make any and all decisions required or permitted
to be taken or made by the Principal Stockholders Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to
execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file (in the name of any or all of
the Principal Stockholders or otherwise) any and all documents and to take any
and all actions that the Principal Stockholders Representative may, in his
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate on or
after the date of this Agreement, including the power to act on behalf of any
Principal Stockholder in any dispute, litigation or arbitration involving this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and the power to receive on behalf of any
Principal Stockholder, and to distribute (after payment of any unpaid expenses
chargeable to such Principal Stockholder in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), all amounts payable
to such Principal Stockholder under the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement; provided that the execution, delivery, acknowledgement,
certification and filing of any such documents and the taking of any such
actions would not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect a
Principal Stockholder as compared to any other Principal Stockholder in his or
her capacity as a Principal Stockholder. The Principal Stockholders shall be
bound by all actions taken by the Principal Stockholders Representative in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow

 



\- 42 -  Agreement in its capacity thereof. The power of attorney granted in this
_Section 8.4_: (i) is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and (ii)
shall survive the bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of each Principal
Stockholder.

(b) The Principal Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any
Principal Stockholder for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered
or omitted to be taken, under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except
in the case of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Principal Stockholders Representative may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The
Principal Stockholders Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or
to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants
or conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. As to any matters
not expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the
Principal Stockholders Representative shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Principal Stockholder severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless and
reimburse the Principal Stockholders Representative from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expense suffered
or incurred by the Principal Stockholders Representative arising out of or
resulting from any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Principal
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
other than such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expense
arising out of or resulting from the Principal Stockholders Representatives
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Principal Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to recover from each Principal Stockholder,
in accordance with such Principal Stockholders ratable portion of the Merger
Consideration, any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Principal Stockholders Representative in good faith and in connection with
actions taken by the Principal Stockholders Representative pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and
the incurring of legal fees and costs). In addition, the Principal
Stockholders Representative shall have a lien on, right of set-off against
and security interest in any payments made to it from the Escrow Fund for the
payment of any amounts to which the Principal Stockholders Representative is
entitled pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Principal Stockholders Representative is expressly authorized to charge
against and withdraw from any payments made to it from the Escrow Fund for
its own account any amounts due to it under this _Section 8.4(b)_. In all
matters relating to this _Article VIII_ , the Principal Stockholders
Representative shall be the only party entitled to assert the rights of the
Principal Stockholders. Parent shall be entitled to rely on the appointment of
the Principal Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 8.4_, to
deal exclusively with the Principal Stockholders Representative on all
matters described in _Section 8.4(a)_, and to rely on any document executed
or purported to be executed on behalf of any Principal Stockholder by the
Principal Stockholders Representative, and on any other action taken
or purported to be taken by the Principal Stockholders Representative on
behalf of any Principal Stockholder by the Principal Stockholders
Representative.
