1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to contain the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except for Article One of the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company, which shall not be amended unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties hereto, and, as so amended and restated, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with
applicable law;

  

  

(b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Bylaws of the Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until amended in

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

  

  

(i) any shares of Company Capital Stock owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (or held in the
Company's treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) except as provided in clause "(i)" above and subject to Sections 1.5(c)
and 1.5(d), each share of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, on an as-
converted basis, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (such number as may be adjusted in accordance with Section
1.5(b)); and

  

  

(iii) each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding shares of Company
Preferred Stock or the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding shares of Parent
Preferred Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, combination of shares, reclassification, recapitalization
or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the
Company or Parent during such period, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

  

  

(c) If any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights, then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement
between the Company and the holder thereof): (i) the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Capital Stock will also be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition; and (ii) the certificates representing such shares of Parent
Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other Contract.

  

  

(d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s), or delivery of non-certificated shares
of Company Capital Stock represented by book entry ("Book Entry Shares"),
subject to Section 1.7(b), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded down to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such
fraction by the 10 trading day average closing price, of a share of Parent
Common Stock traded on the NASDAQ (instead of the daily volume-weighted
average prices), ending on the last Business Day prior to the date on which
the Merger becomes effective (the "Parent Common Stock Price").

  

  

1.6 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
all holders of Book Entry Shares or of certificates representing shares of
Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the
right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 1.5,
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section1.7(c); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") or a Book Entry Share is
presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be canceled and shall
be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall arrange for its transfer agent to
act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall issue and cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent: (i) non-certificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by book
entry issuable pursuant to Section 1.5; and (ii) cash sufficient to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d). The
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange
Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange
Agent with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, are referred to
collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the
Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
and the Company shall reasonably approve prior to the Effective Time
(including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates
or Book Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent); and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for non-certificated shares of
Parent Common Stock in book entry form. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other customary documents
as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder
of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive, and the Exchange Agent shall (and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to) in exchange therefor transfer from the Exchange Fund to such holder
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shares shall be
certificated and bear an appropriate legend to the effect that such shares
have not been registered under the Securities Act and are therefore subject to
restrictions on transfer) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(c)); and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock
Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
(and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as
contemplated by Section 1.5 and any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to Section 1.7(c). If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition to the
issuance of any non-certificated shares of Parent Common Stock in book entry
form, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and indemnification obligation
and/or post a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Exchange
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such
holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share in
accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled,
subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

  

  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares as of the date that is one
year after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent
Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

  

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Capital Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid. The Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate
any such withholding.

  

  

(f) All transfer, documentary, registration and other such Taxes (including,
without limitation, charges for or in connection with the recording of any
instrument or document as provided in this Agreement) payable in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be timely paid by Parent.

  

  

(g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Capital Stock or to any other Person with respect
to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or for any cash amounts required to be delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law
or other Legal Requirement.

  

  

1.8 Issuance of Shares of Surviving Corporation. On the Effective Date, the
Surviving Corporation will issue ninety nine shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation to Parent in consideration for Parent issuing Parent
Common Stock to the stockholders of the Company in satisfaction of the right
granted pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(ii).

  

  

1.9 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code that is not subject to the application of Section 367(a)(1) of the
Code. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

  

  

1.11 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being
referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a
right to receive the applicable amount of Parent Common Stock contemplated by
Section 1.5(a)(ii), but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the
Effective Time of the Merger, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Capital Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable amount of Parent
Common Stock contemplated by Section 1.5(a)(ii), if any, to which such holder
is entitled. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Capital
Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
the Company to, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

from the value of the assets subject thereto or materially impair the
operations of any of the Owl Corporations).

connection with: (x) the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement;
or (y) the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Contemplated

matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except for the representations

resale under the Securities Act and a seasoning period under Section 2.6(3) of
National Instrument 45-102. The Company further understands and acknowledges

certified to represent any Tiger Corporation employees, none of the Tiger

agreements or other contracts or agreements with any trade unions or employee
associations whether or not the expiry date of such collective agreements or
other contract or agreement has passed, and there are no voluntary
recognitions by trade unions or employee associations relating to employees of
Tiger Corporations and no pending applications for certification by trade

employment or termination of current or former Tiger Corporation employees.

  

  

(d) Parent has delivered or Made Available to the Company an accurate and
complete list, by country and as of the date of this Agreement, of each Parent
Employee Plan and each Parent Employee Agreement. None of the Tiger
Corporations intends, and none of the Tiger Corporations has committed, to
establish or enter into any new Parent Employee Plan or Parent Employee
Agreement, or to modify any Parent Employee Plan or Parent Employee Agreement
(except to conform any such Parent Employee Plan or Parent Employee Agreement
to the requirements of any applicable Legal Requirements, in each case as
previously disclosed to Parent in writing or as required by this Agreement).

  

  

(e) Parent has delivered or Made Available to the Company accurate and
complete copies of: (i) all documents setting forth the terms of each Parent
Employee Plan and each Parent Employee Agreement, including all amendments

48  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Each of the Tiger Corporations and Parent Affiliates has performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under each
Parent Employee Plan and Parent Employee Agreement, and each Parent Employee
Plan and Parent Employee Agreement has been established and maintained in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Legal
Requirements. Any Parent Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code. All Parent
Pension Plans required to have been approved by any foreign Governmental Body
have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the
date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such
Parent Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to materially affect any
such approval relating thereto or materially increase the costs relating
thereto. Each Parent Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified or to have a
specific tax status under applicable Legal Requirements is so tax qualified or
has maintained that tax status as applicable, and no event has occurred and no
circumstance or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result
in the disqualification of any such Parent Employee Plan. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Parent Employee Plan. Each Parent Employee Plan
(other than any Parent Employee Plan to be terminated prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with this Agreement) can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without
liability to Parent, any of the Tiger Corporations or any Parent Affiliate
(other than any liability for ordinary administration expenses). There are no
audits or inquiries pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by the
IRS, the DOL or any other Governmental Body with respect to any Parent
Employee Plan or any fiduciary thereof. There are no actions, suits or claims
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or reasonably anticipated
(other than routine claims for benefits) against any Parent Employee Plan or
against the assets of any Parent Employee Plan. None of the Tiger
Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any material
penalty or tax with respect to any Parent Employee Plan under Section 502(i)
of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any material
penalty or Tax under applicable Legal Requirements. Each of the Tiger
Corporations and Parent Affiliates has made all contributions and other
payments required by and due under the terms of each Parent Employee Plan and
each Parent Employee Agreement. Neither the terms nor the performance of any
Parent Employee Agreement or Parent Employee Plan would reasonably be expected
to result in gross income inclusion after the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

  

  

(g) None of the Tiger Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any: (i)
"pension plan" including without limitation a defined benefit or target
benefit pension plan; (ii) Parent Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA;
(iii) "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA or
within the meaning of the pension standards legislation that would apply to
such a plan; or (iv) plan described in Section 413 of the Code. No Parent
Employee Plan is or has been funded by, associated with or related to a
"voluntary employees' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code. None of the Tiger Corporations, and no Parent
Affiliate, has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to any Parent Pension Plan in which stock of any of the Tiger
Corporations or any Parent Affiliate is or was held as a plan asset. The fair
market value of the assets of each funded Parent Foreign Plan (or other such
method of valuing the assets as is permitted or required by the applicable
Legal Requirements), the liability of each insurer for any Parent Foreign Plan
funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Parent
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect
to all current and former participants in such Parent Foreign Plan according
to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Parent Foreign
Plan such that no special payments are required to be made in respect of the
Parent Pension Plan, and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such
assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.
There are no material liabilities of the Tiger Corporations with respect to
any Parent Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the
financial statements of Parent in accordance with GAAP.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

(h) None of the Tiger Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, maintains,
sponsors or contributes to any Parent Employee Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), a
"health and welfare trust" or an "employee life and health trust" (as such
terms are used by the Canada Revenue Agency or defined in the Income Tax Act
(Canada)) and that is, in whole or in part, self-funded or self-insured. No
Parent Employee Plan provides (except at no cost to the Tiger Corporations or
any Parent Affiliate), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the
Tiger Corporations or any Parent Affiliate to provide, post-termination or
retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other
post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements. None of the Tiger Corporations nor any Parent Affiliate has ever
represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any
Parent Associate (either individually or to Parent Associates as a group) or
any other Person that such Parent Associate(s) or other Person would be
provided with post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or
retiree health benefits or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare
benefits, except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

  

  

(i) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and
except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will or would reasonably be expected to (either alone or in
connection with any other circumstance or event) constitute an event under any
Parent Employee Plan, Parent Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or
may result (either alone or in connection with any other circumstance or
event) in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Parent Associate.

  

  

(j) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(j) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
each of the Tiger Corporations and Parent Affiliates: (i) is, and has at all
times been, in compliance in all material respects with any Order or
arbitration award of any court, arbitrator or any Governmental Body respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,
hours, working classification (including the proper classification of workers
as independent contractors and consultants), occupational safety and health
and employment practices, including the Immigration Reform and Control Act, or
other labor related matters; (ii) has, to the Knowledge of Parent, withheld
and reported all amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by
Contract to be withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other
payments to Parent Associates; (iii) is not, to the Knowledge of Parent,
liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any interest or penalty for
failure to comply with the Legal Requirements applicable to the foregoing;
(iv) is not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to workers
compensation assessments and benefits, unemployment compensation benefits,
social security, social charges or other benefits or obligations for Parent
Associates (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice); and (v) is not liable for any
unpaid wages, compensation, wage-related penalties, or other sums for failure
to comply with any of the foregoing. There are no controversies pending, or to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened between any of the Tiger Corporations and
any current or former employee, which controversies would reasonably be
expected to result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or
investigation before any Governmental Body.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

(k) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
Parent Associate, and no payments have been made or will be made in connection
with the Merger to any Parent Associate, that, considered individually or
considered collectively with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or
would reasonably be expected to, be characterized as a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to Section 162(m) of the Code (or any comparable provision under state or
foreign Tax laws). No Tiger Corporation is a party to or has any obligation
under any Contract to compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant
to Section 4999 of the Code or for taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of
the Code.

payment of monies by the Tiger Corporations of not more than $100,000 in the

provisions of this Section 4) or fail to take any action reasonably necessary
to cause the Merger to so qualify, or take any action that would reasonably be

expected to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly: (i) advise
the Company in writing of any material Legal Proceeding or material claim
threatened, commenced or asserted against or with respect to any of the Tiger
Corporations and (ii) provide copies to the Company of any material letters,
notices or other written communications from any Governmental Body that it

pursuant to this Section 4.3(c) shall limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of Parent contained in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; provided however, that a failure to comply with this Section 4.3(c)
will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7 to be
satisfied unless the underlying event, condition, fact or circumstance would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7 to
be satisfied.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

4.4 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, directly or
indirectly, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries not to (and the
Company shall direct the other Representatives of the Owl Corporations not to,
and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that the other
Representatives of the Owl Corporations do not), directly or indirectly:

  

  

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Owl
Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Owl Corporation;

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall not, directly or indirectly,
and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective directors and
officers of the Parent and its Subsidiaries not to (and the Parent shall
direct the other Representatives of the Tiger Corporations not to, and the
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that the other

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to a Tiger
Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to a Tiger Corporation;

  

  

(ii) knowingly furnish any information regarding any of the Tiger Corporations
to any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to a Tiger Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to a
Tiger Corporation;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62

Acquisition Proposal with respect to a Tiger Corporation or Acquisition
Inquiry with respect to a Tiger Corporation;

  

  

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect to a
Tiger Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to a Tiger Corporation;
or

  

  

(v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract

Acquisition Inquiry with respect to a Tiger Corporation;

  

  

provided, however, that prior to the approval of the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Required Parent Stockholder Vote,
this Section 4.4(b) shall not prohibit Parent from furnishing information
(including non-public information) regarding the Tiger Corporations to, or
entering into discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to Parent by such Person (and not
withdrawn) which after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, the Parent Board determines
in good faith is, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a Parent
Superior Offer if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from any
breach of, or any action inconsistent with, any of the provisions set forth in
this Section 4.4; (B) the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board under
applicable law; (C) at least two Business Days prior to furnishing any such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, Parent gives the Company written notice of the identity of such Person
and of Parent's intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions
with, such Person, and Parent receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement (which the Parent may discuss with such Person
during the two day period) containing provisions (including nondisclosure
provisions, use restrictions and non-solicitation provisions) at least as
favorable to Parent as the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in
effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (provided that the
non-solicitation provisions shall permit the making of an Acquisition Proposal
and provided further that the requirement to execute a confidentiality
agreement shall not apply if the Person making or proposing to make the
Acquisition Proposal is already party to a confidentiality agreement with the
Parent at least as favorable to Parent as the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement); and (D) at least two Business Days prior to furnishing any
such information to such Person, Parent furnishes such information to the
Company (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or
Made Available by Parent to the Company). The Company and Parent agree that
any breach or violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.4 by
(x) any director or officer of a Tiger Corporation will be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 4.4 by Parent or (y) any other Representative of a
Tiger Corporation will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.4 by Parent
for purposes of subclause (A) of the preceding sentence and for purposes of
Section 5.3(c).

  

  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than
24 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Owl
Corporation or a Tiger Corporation, as the case may be, or Acquisition Inquiry
with respect to an Owl Corporation or a Tiger Corporation, as the case may be)
advise the other party to this Agreement orally and in writing of any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
and the terms thereof, including a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-
Closing Period. Each party receiving an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry shall keep the other party informed with respect to: (i) the status of
any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; and (ii) the status and
terms of any material modification or proposed material modification thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions conducted on or before the date of this Agreement
with any Person that relates to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry.

  

  

(e) Each of Parent and the Company agrees not to release or permit the release
of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar Contract
to which any such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which
any such party or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its
reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced to the extent
requested by the other party to this Agreement except to the extent that the
Parent Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Parent Board under applicable law.

5.1 Proxy Statement; Information Circular. As promptly as practicable after

provide the Company (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement and Circular, and any amendment or
supplement thereto, prior to filing of any such document with the SEC, the TSX
and if applicable, any other Governmental Authority. Parent shall cause to be
filed with the SEC, the TSX and if applicable, any other Governmental
Authority the Proxy Statement and Circular and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and Circular to be mailed to
Parent's stockholders as promptly as practicable. Each of Parent and the
Company shall promptly furnish to the other party all information concerning
such party, its Subsidiaries and stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
Section 5.1. If either Parent or the Company becomes aware of any information
that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or Circular, then such party: (i) shall promptly inform the other party
thereof; (ii) shall provide the other party (and its counsel) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or Circular prior to it being filed with the SEC, the TSX
and if applicable, any other Governmental Authority; (iii) shall provide the
other party with a copy of such amendment or supplement promptly after it is

5.2 Federal and State Blue Sky Laws. Parent shall take such steps within its
control as may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of
all jurisdictions which are applicable to the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(ii). The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent as may be necessary to comply with
the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.5(a)(ii).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

5.3 Parent Stockholders' Meeting.

  

  

(a) Parent: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
Parent Common Stock (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting") to vote on (w) a
proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock under the
Contemplated Transactions pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 and Part 6 of
the TSX Company Manual, (x) a proposal to approve the Governance Amendments to
Parent Articles as contemplated herein, (y) if required by the TSX, a proposal
to approve the adoption of the Company Options and Company Option Plan; and
(z) the shareholder advisory vote contemplated by Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act; and (ii) shall submit such proposals to such holders at the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such
holders in connection with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting without the prior
written consent of the Company. Parent in consultation with the Company shall
set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the
prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall ensure that all proxies
solicited by the Tiger Corporations and their Representatives in connection
with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent may after consultation with the Company
adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders' Meeting only: (i) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or
Circular that is required by applicable Legal Requirement (or in connection
with the settlement of any applicable litigation) is timely provided to
Parent's stockholders; (ii) if as of the time for which the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting; or (iii) if additional time is reasonably required to
solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the
approval thereof. Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with Section 8, its obligations to hold the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
Parent of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to a Tiger Corporation or
Acquisition Inquiry with respect to a Tiger Corporation or by any Parent
Change in Recommendation or the entering into any Alternative Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.3(c): (i) the Proxy Statement and Circular shall
include a statement to the effect that the Parent Board has determined that
this Agreement and the Merger is in the best interests of Parent and fair to
its stockholders, and recommends that Parent's stockholders vote to approve
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger at the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting (such determination and recommendation being referred to
as the "Parent Board Recommendation"); (ii) the Parent Board Recommendation
shall not be directly or indirectly withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse
to the Company; (iii) neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof
shall: (A) fail to publicly reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation, or fail
to publicly state that this Agreement and the Merger are in the best interests
of Parent and fair to its stockholders, within five Business Days after the
Company requests in writing that such action be taken, provided that the
Company has a reasonable basis for making such request; (B) fail to publicly
announce, within ten Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer
relating to the securities of Parent shall have been commenced, a statement
disclosing that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer; (C) fail to issue, within five Business Days after an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to a Tiger Corporation is publicly
announced, a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (D) resolve to take any action described in clauses "(ii)" or
"(iii)" of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in clauses
"(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to as a "Parent Change in Recommendation").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of the issuance
of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Required Parent
Stockholder Vote, the Parent Board may effect, or cause Parent to effect, as
the case may be, a Parent Change in Recommendation:

  

  

(i) if: (A) Parent has not breached its obligations under Section 4.4 in
connection with the offer referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B) after
the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal is made to Parent and not withdrawn (provided, however, that for
purposes of this Section 5.3(c)(i), all references to "15%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Transaction" as used in "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed
substituted with "90%"); (C) the Parent Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a Parent
Superior Offer; (D) the Parent Board does not effect, or cause Parent to
effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation at any time within five Business
Days after the Company receives written notice from Parent confirming that the
Parent Board has determined that such offer is a Parent Superior Offer
(provided, a new notice shall be required with respect to each material
modification to such offer); (E) during such five Business Day period, if
requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the
Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was
determined to constitute a Parent Superior Offer no longer constitutes a
Parent Superior Offer; (F) at the end of such five Business Day period, such
offer has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Parent Superior
Offer (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by the Company as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or
otherwise); and (G) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Parent
Superior Offer, a failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board under applicable
law; or

  

  

(ii) if: (A) other than (1) the development or circumstances contemplated by
clause "(i)" of this Section 5.3(c) or (2) in connection with or as a result
of the making of, or any development or circumstance relating to, an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to a Tiger Corporation or an Acquisition
Inquiry with respect to a Tiger Corporation, a material development or change
in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was
neither known to the Parent Board or any executive officer nor reasonably
foreseeable to the Parent Board or any executive officer of Parent as of the
date of this Agreement and does not relate to (x) events, changes or
circumstances relating to Company or any of its Affiliates, (y) clearance of
the Merger under the antitrust laws or (z) the mere fact that Parent meets or
exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or
predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for
any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement, or changes after the
date of this Agreement (however, the underlying reasons for such events may
constitute such material event, development or change in circumstances) (such
material development or change in circumstances being referred to as an
"Intervening Event"); (B) at least five Business Days prior to any meeting of
the Parent Board at which the Parent Board will consider whether such
Intervening Event requires the Parent Board to effect, or cause Parent to
effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation, Parent provides the Company with a
written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons
for holding such meeting; (C) during such five Business Day period, if
requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the
Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for
the Parent Board to effect, or cause Parent to effect, a Parent Change in
Recommendation as a result of such Intervening Event; and (D) the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a failure to make a Parent
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Parent Board under applicable law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) (i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 will prohibit Parent from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) no disclosure that the
Parent Board may determine (after consultation with outside counsel) that it
or Parent, as applicable, is required to make under applicable law will
constitute a violation of this Agreement; provided, however, that in any event
the Parent Board shall not make a Parent Change in Recommendation except in
accordance with this Section 5.3. Any public disclosure or statement by a
Tiger Corporation (or any of their respective Representatives) relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or Intervening Event with respect
to a Tiger Corporation (other than a 'stop, look and listen' communication)
shall be deemed to be a Parent Change in Recommendation unless the Parent
Board reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation in such disclosure or
statement.

  

  

(e) Following a Parent Change in Recommendation made or effected pursuant to
Section 5.3(c)(i), Parent may enter into a definitive agreement providing for
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Parent Superior Offer
to which such Parent Change in Recommendation relates provided that (i) the
effectiveness of such agreement is conditioned on the termination of this
Agreement, (ii) none of Parent nor any of the other Tiger Corporations has any
obligation or liability of any kind pursuant to such agreement prior to the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee,
and (iii) such agreement automatically terminates without any further action
by any party thereto and without any payment, penalty or other obligation or
liability of any kind if and when the Required Parent Stockholder Vote is
obtained (an "Alternative Agreement").

  

  

5.4 Company Options and Company Restricted Shares.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Option Plan and all
awards granted thereunder that are assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section
5.4 (together with all agreements that govern the treatment of such assumed
awards (each, an "Award Agreement")). From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards under the Company Option Plan,
to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share
reserve of such Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time, except that: (i)
stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all
references in such Company Option Plan to a number of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of
Company Common Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii)
the Parent Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to
the administration of such Company Option Plan and Award Agreement.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option,
whether vested or unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder of a Company Option, be
assumed by Parent. Each such Company Option so assumed by Parent hereunder
(each, an "Adjusted Option") shall, subject to the requirements of the TSX,
continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Company Option under the
Company Option Plan and applicable Award Agreements immediately before the
Effective Time, except that, (i) each Adjusted Option will be exercisable for
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock to which the corresponding Company Option related immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient of (x) the per share
exercise price of the Company Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. The date of grant of each Adjusted Option will be the
date on which the corresponding Company Option was granted. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the adjustment described in this Section 5.4(b) shall be made
in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code and, with respect to each
Company Option that is an incentive stock option (within the meaning of
Section 422(b) of the Code), no adjustment will be made that would be a
modification (within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code) to such
Company Option.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, shall, without any further action on
the part of any holder of a Company Restricted Share, be assumed by Parent and
shall be converted into a comparable award in respect of Parent Common Stock
(each, an "Adjusted Restricted Share Award"). Each Adjusted Restricted Share
Award shall continue to have and be subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Share under the
Company Option Plan and applicable Award Agreements immediately before the
Effective Time, except that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such Adjusted Restricted Share Award shall be equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
the lapse of restrictions or conditions on vesting applicable to such Company
Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock
subject to an Adjusted Restricted Share Award and (B) the per share purchase
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Company
Restricted Share will be equal to the quotient of (i) the per share purchase
price, if applicable, of the Company Restricted Share, and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

  

  

(d) As soon as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) days) after
the Effective Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8,
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Company
Options or Company Restricted Shares assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.4 and Parent shall exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement until such time as the shares of
Parent Common Stock underlying each such Company Option or Company Restricted
Share assumed by Parent have been issued or such Company Option or Company
Restricted Share has been terminated, expired, cancelled or forfeited.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time:

  

  

(i) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary, including any action to
be taken under Section 5.3(a)(i)(y) to approve the adoption of the Company
Options and Company Option Plan, to reserve for issuance a sufficient number
of Parent Stock as is equal to the aggregate number of Parent Stock issuable
after the Effective Time (i) upon exercise of the Adjusted Options, and (ii)
in respect of each share of Adjusted Restricted Share Award; and

  

  

(ii) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all
action that may be necessary (under the Company Option Plan, Award Agreements
and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.4 and to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Equity Awards have
no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this
Section 5.4.

  

  

5.5 Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that, subject to any necessary transition period and subject
to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal
Requirements all employees of the Owl Corporations who continue employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be
eligible to participate in Parent's health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to
substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except
for Company Indemnified Persons to the extent of their respective rights
pursuant to Section 5.6, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee,
shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Except for
Parent Indemnified Persons to the extent of their respective rights pursuant
to Section 5.6(b), no Parent Associate, shall be deemed to be a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA and each vacation and severance plan (that is not an "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Continuing Employee will participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with the Owl Corporations for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and participation, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, in any
such Parent Benefit Plan to the extent such service was credited under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and subject to the concurrence
of any third-party insurers (which Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, other than preexisting condition limitations, exclusions
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees and that have not been satisfied or waived as of the Effective Time
under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in
which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the Owl
Corporations or the Tiger Corporations to continue any specific Company
Employee Plan or Parent Employee Plan. The provisions of this Section 5.5 are
for the sole benefit of Parent and the Company and nothing in this Section
5.5, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to constitute an
amendment of any Company Employee Plan or Parent Employee Plan (or an
undertaking to amend any such plan) or other compensation and benefits plan
maintained for or provided to Company Employees, including Continuing
Employees, prior to, on or following the Effective Time.

  

  

5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

  

  

(a) Company Indemnified Person.

  

  

(i) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities by the Company or its Subsidiaries existing in favor of those
Persons who are current or former directors or officers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Indemnified
Persons") for their acts and omissions as directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Effective
Time, as provided in the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in any
indemnification agreements between the Company and said Company Indemnified
Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), shall survive the
Merger and be observed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and any
applicable Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law for
a period of six years from the date on which the Merger becomes effective.
Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of current and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and such
Subsidiaries, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
Person benefited by such provisions without such Person's prior written
consent. Parent guarantees the full and timely performance of the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under this Section 5.6(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase a directors' and officers' liability insurance
"tail policy" with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time, and
on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties
than those in effect under the Company Existing DandO Policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement, for the benefit of the Company Indemnified Persons
with respect to their acts and omissions as directors, officers, employees and
agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Effective
Time. If such "tail policy" is not obtained then from the Effective Time until
the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Company
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors'
and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company as
of the date of this Agreement in the form delivered or Made Available by the
Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Existing
DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage is commercially available; provided, however, that: (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute for the Company Existing DandO Policy a policy or
policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay annual premiums for the Company Existing DandO Policy (or for
any substitute policies) in excess of 250% of the annual premium paid by the
Company for the Company Existing DandO Policy (the "Company Maximum Premium").
In the event any future annual premiums for the Company Existing DandO Policy
(or any substitute policies) exceed the Company Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Company
Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage
that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Company Maximum Premium.

  

  

(b) Parent Indemnified Person.

  

  

(i) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities by the Parent or its Subsidiaries existing in favor of those
Persons who are current or former directors or officers of the Parent or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time (the "Parent Indemnified
Persons") for their acts and omissions as directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Parent or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Effective
Time, as provided in the Parent's certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in any
indemnification agreements between the Parent and said Parent Indemnified
Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), shall survive the
Merger and be observed by the Parent and such Subsidiaries to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law for a period of six years from the date on
which the Merger becomes effective.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective, the Parent shall maintain in effect, for the
benefit of the Parent Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and
omissions as directors, officers, employees or agents of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, the existing
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Parent as of the date of this Agreement in the form delivered or Made
Available by the Parent to Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Parent Existing DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; provided, however,
that: (i) the Parent may substitute for the Parent Existing DandO Policy a
policy or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the Parent shall not be
required to pay annual premiums for the Parent Existing DandO Policy (or for any
substitute policies) in excess of 250% of the annual premium paid by the
Parent for Parent's Existing DandO Policy (the "Parent Maximum Premium"). In the
event any future annual premiums for the Parent Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute policies) exceed the Parent Maximum Premium, the Parent shall be
entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Parent Existing DandO Policy
(or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained
for a premium equal to the Parent Maximum Premium.

  

  

(c) Parent shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, which any Company Indemnified Person or Parent
Indemnified Person may incur in enforcing the indemnification and other
obligations provided for in this Section 5.6.

  

  

(d) This Section 5.6 is intended to be (i) for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Persons and the Parent Indemnified
Persons, their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns, (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any Company Indemnified Person or Parent Indemnified
Person may have by contract or otherwise, including indemnification agreements
that the Company or Parent have entered into with any of their respective
directors or officers and (iii) may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Person or Parent Indemnified Person (provided that such amendment,
alteration or repeal prior to the Effective Time shall be governed by Section
9.1). In the event that the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, Parent (or
its successor, as applicable), shall make proper provision so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the Parent (as the case
may be) honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this
Section 5.6. This Section 5.6 shall survive consummation of the Merger.

  

  

5.7 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in all events within 15
Business Days after the date of this Agreement), all notices, reports and
other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body
with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to
submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental
Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent
shall, promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after the date of
this Agreement, prepare and file the notifications required under the HSR Act
in connection with the Merger. The Company and Parent each shall promptly (i)
supply the other party with any information which may be required in order to
effectuate notices, reports, documents or other filings with any Governmental
Body required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act (the "Antitrust Filings");
and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to supply any additional information
which is required by any Governmental Body in connection with Antitrust
Filings or which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate. Each of the
Company and Parent will notify the other party promptly upon the receipt of
(A) any comments from any Governmental Bodies in connection with any Antitrust
Filings made pursuant hereto; and (B) any request by any Governmental Bodies
for amendments or supplements to any Antitrust Filings made pursuant to, or
information provided to comply in all material respects with, the requirements
of the HSR Act. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any Antitrust Filings, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, will promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body such amendment or
supplement. Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other party prompt
notice of the commencement or known threat of commencement of any Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or
any of the other Contemplated Transactions, keep the other party reasonably
informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat, and in
connection with any such Legal Proceeding, each of the Company or Parent will
permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding, to the extent
permitted by the applicable Governmental Body, and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such Proceeding.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71

reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
or advisable to satisfy each of the conditions set forth in Section 6 and
Section 7, consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated
Transactions (provided that no party shall be required to waive any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6 or Section 7, as applicable, to its
obligations to consummate the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section
5.7(c), each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any) and
give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in
connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) shall use reasonable best efforts to lift
any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.7,
neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall have any obligation under
this Agreement to divest or agree to divest (or cause any of its Subsidiaries
to divest or agree to divest) any of its respective material businesses,
material product lines or material assets, or to take or agree to take (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take) any other material
action or agree (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to agree) to any material
limitation or material restriction on any of its respective material
businesses, material product lines or material assets; provided, however, each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consider in good faith any
divestiture that would not be reasonably likely to (i) give rise to a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) materially
impair the benefits or advantages it expects to receive from the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) give rise to a material adverse
effect on the business plan or business strategy of the combined company.

  

  

5.8 Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before

the Company Associates generally, with respect to the Merger or any of the
other Contemplated Transactions. The Parent shall consult with the Company and
consider the views and comments of the Company before any of the Tiger
Corporations or any of their Representatives sends any emails or other
documents to the Parent Associates generally or otherwise communicate with the
Parent Associates generally, with respect to the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) each party may,
without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to
questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences and make internal announcements to employees, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by
the other party), (ii) a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement as may be required by Legal Requirement or the rules
and regulations of the NASDAQ and the TSX if it first notifies and consults
with the other party hereto prior to issuing any such press release or making
any such public announcement or statement; and (iii) Parent need not consult
with the Company in connection with any press release, public statement or
filing to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition Proposal relating
to Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries or any Parent Change in Recommendation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

5.9 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company (i)
shall report the Merger on their Tax Returns as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) shall, to the extent required,
report the Merger on their Tax Returns as not being subject to Section
367(a)(1) of the Code as a result of the operation of Section 1.367(a)-3(c) of
the Code, (iii) shall not take any inconsistent position with the foregoing on
any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Tax authority or other
tribunal, and (iv) shall not take any action, cause or permit any action to be
taken or fail to take any action, that would cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" described in Section 368(a) of the Code or that
would cause the Merger to be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code.

  

  

(b) For so long as the Person listed on Schedule 5.9(b) owns stock of Parent,
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid, in respect of any taxable
year, being a passive foreign investment company within the meaning of Section
1297 of the Code (a "PFIC"), including, but not limited to, causing a
Subsidiary to file an election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3. No later than 75 days after the end of each fiscal year, Parent
shall deliver to the Shareholder an analysis as to whether the Parent believes
that it will be treated as a PFIC in respect of such taxable year. Such
analysis may be prepared by Parent, but in preparing such analysis Parent
shall consult with its internationally recognized tax advisors.

  

  

(c) Parent shall provide, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to provide
to the Person listed on Schedule 5.9(b), all information that may be necessary
to allow such Person (or its direct or indirect owners) to evaluate the
analysis referenced in Section 5.9(b) and to fulfill their U.S. tax filing and
reporting obligations. Parent shall provide, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to provide, such information to the Person listed on Schedule
5.9(b) as direct and indirect owners of such Person may reasonably require to
timely file and maintain a "qualified electing fund" ("QEF") election (as
defined in Section 1295(a) of the Code) with respect to any such entity.

  

  

(d) Parent shall cause the Company to comply with the reporting requirements
of United States Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6) applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereunder, and any other reporting requirements
applicable to a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Code or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.9 (or in
Sections 4.2(b)(xviii) or Section 4.3(b)(xviii)), none of Parent, its
Subsidiaries, or the Company will be required to comply with the undertakings
set forth in Section 5.9(a) or (d) unless: (i) the shareholders of the Company
immediately prior to the completion of the Merger have provided the Company or
Parent, as applicable, with the information relating to such shareholders that
is necessary for the Company or Parent, as applicable, (A) to establish the
requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(i) and
(B) to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), and (ii) with
respect to the application of Sections 5.9(a) and (d) to a shareholder of the
Company immediately prior to the completion of the Merger, if that shareholder
is a "five-percent transferee shareholder" as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such shareholder has entered into the five-year
agreement referenced in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B).

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(c) For purposes of this Section 5.16, "participate" means that the non-

date of this Agreement) or a breach of a covenant or obligation by the Company
is curable by the Company by the End Date and the Company is continuing to
exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) on account
of such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain
uncured for a period of 30 days commencing on the date that Parent gives the
Company notice of such inaccuracy or breach;

  

  

(g) by the Company if: (i) any of Parent's representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) or the condition
set forth in Section 7.1(b) would not then be satisfied, or shall have become
inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made
on such subsequent date) such that the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a)
or the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) would not then be satisfied; or
(ii) any of Parent's covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement
shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2

following a Parent Change in Recommendation, or (iii) by either Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the Parent Stockholders' Meeting has not
been held prior to the End Date and the failure to hold the Parent
Stockholder\'s Meeting is not attributable to a failure on the part of the
Company to perform any covenant or obligation of this Agreement by the time
the Company is required to perform such covenant or obligation, then Parent
shall pay to the Company, in cash at the time specified in the following
sentence, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $12,000,000 (the "Parent
Termination Fee"); provided, however, that, if there has been (a) no
Acquisition Proposal made or proposed for any of the Tiger Corporations prior
to the time of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting that has become publicly known
and (b) no Parent Change in Recommendation, then in the case of a termination
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), the Parent Termination Fee shall be
$5,000,000. The Parent Termination Fee shall be paid as follows: in the case
of termination by Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence, simultaneously
with Parent's termination of the Agreement and in the case of termination by
the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence, within two Business Days after
termination of this Agreement.

reasonable amount for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
the parties in connection with the matter forming the basis for such
termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, and provided the Company has not (i) notified Parent that it is not
accepting the Parent Termination Fee, which notification shall occur, if at
all, within 5 Business Days following the applicable termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) refunded the Parent Termination Fee in full to Parent
within 5 Business Days following payment thereof, if the Parent Termination
Fee has been previously paid hereunder, the parties agree that the payments
contemplated by this Section 8.3 represent the sole and exclusive remedy of
the parties and that, except for the payments expressly set forth in this
Section 8.3, each of the parties and their respective affiliates shall have no
liability, shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action
or proceeding against the other, shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the other, at law or in equity or otherwise, and shall not seek to
obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind against the other (or any
partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Subsidiary,
affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or parties) in
connection with or arising out of the termination of this Agreement, any
breach of or by any party giving rise to such termination or the failure of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated.

  

  

(d) If a party fails to pay when due any amount payable by such party under
this Section 8.3, then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other party for all
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the
enforcement by the other party of its rights under this Section 8.3; and (ii)
such party shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount (for
the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid through the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
the other party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the lower of: (i) 350
basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of America, N.A. or
any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid; or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements.

by Parent's stockholders); provided, however, that: (a) after any such
adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders, no amendment shall

writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

  

9.2 Waiver.

  

  

(a) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this

remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

  

  

(b) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is

behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms (it being understood that no provision in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall limit any party's rights or remedies in the case of fraud). This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same

7.4 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable

7.6 Assignment; Binding Effect. Except as provided herein, neither this
Agreement nor any of the interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by Shareholder, by operation of law or otherwise, and any attempted
or purported assignment or delegation of any of such interests or obligations
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon Shareholder and Shareholder's heirs, estate, executors and
personal representatives and Shareholder's successors and assigns, and shall
inure to the benefit of Company and its successors and assigns. Without
limiting any of the restrictions set forth in Section 2 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon any Person to whom any Subject
Securities are transferred. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer on
any Person (other than Parent and its successors and assigns) any rights or
remedies of any nature.

  


 

  

7.7 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Shareholder agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, Company
shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to
it, including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (a) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. Shareholder further agrees that neither Company nor any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 7.7, and Shareholder irrevocably waives any right
he or it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

  


 

  

7.8 Non-Exclusivity. The rights and remedies of Company under this Agreement
are not exclusive of or limited by any other rights or remedies which it may
have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of which shall
be cumulative (and not alternative). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the rights and remedies of Company under this Agreement, and the
obligations and liabilities of Shareholder under this Agreement, are in
addition to their respective rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities
under common law requirements and under all applicable statutes, rules and
regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of Shareholder's
obligations, or the rights or remedies of Company, under any other agreement
between Company and Shareholder; and nothing in any such other agreement shall
limit any of Shareholder's obligations, or any of the rights or remedies of
Company, under this Agreement.

  


 

  

7.9 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal
laws of Canada applicable therein and each of the parties attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia for all purposes
hereof. Nothing contained in this Section 7.9 shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the right of Shareholder or Company to commence any legal
proceeding or otherwise proceed against the other in any other forum or
jurisdiction.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

7.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all

addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

  


 

  

7.13 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
supplemented, or otherwise modified or terminated, except upon the execution
and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. No failure
on the part of Company to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, and no delay on the part of Company in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of
such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of
any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. Company
shall not be deemed to have waived any claim available to such party arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy of such party
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered by or on behalf of Company; and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is
given.

The undersigned represents and warrants that it is not a party to any
agreement or understanding that would cause a breach of this Lock-Up Agreement
if it were entered into during the period in which the restrictions set forth
herein are effective.

  


 

  

The undersigned acknowledges that the execution, delivery and performance of
this Lock-Up Agreement is a material inducement to the Company to enter into
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the Company shall

to the Company for which monetary damages will not be adequate and that, in

remains uncured for at least thirty (30) days after notice to the Company

furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and any duly appointed transfer
agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described herein are
hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such
transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Agreement.

  


 

  

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Lock-Up Agreement.
All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred and any obligations
of the undersigned shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs or
personal representatives of the undersigned. This Lock-Up Agreement may not be
amended or otherwise modified in any respect without the written consent of

or exchangeable for Common Stock (including, but not limited to, Common Stock

sell or otherwise dispose of any swap, option, future, forward or other
agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic

For the purpose of this Lock-Up Agreement, the "Lock-Up Period" shall mean

WHEREAS, in order to induce OnCore to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
OnCore Holders and the Company have agreed to enter into this Agreement
providing for certain rights related to the registration of the shares of the
Company to be received by the OnCore Holders pursuant to the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

  

  

1. REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The Company covenants and agrees as follows:

solely to the sale of securities to participants in a Company stock plan, a

transaction of the nature covered by Rule 145 under the Act, a registration
statement on any form that does not include substantially the same information
as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the
sale of the Registrable Securities, or a registration statement in which the
only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
debt securities that are also being registered.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(g) The term "Form S-3" means such form under the Act as in effect on the date

similar document in compliance with the Act, and the declaration or ordering
of effectiveness of such registration statement or document under the Act.

Securities shall not include any securities (x) sold by a person to the public

under Section 1 of this Agreement are not assigned or (z) held by a Holder
(together with its affiliates and other Holders that share a common investment
advisor with such Holder) if such Holder (together with its affiliates and
other Holders that share a common investment advisor with such Holder)
beneficially owns less than 3% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common
Stock, if such securities may then be sold pursuant to Rule 144(b)(1).

  

  

(n) The "number of Registrable Securities" outstanding shall be determined by

1.2 Form S-3 Shelf Registration.

  

  

(a) After the closing of the Merger, the Company shall file a resale
registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Resale Registration Statement") in
accordance with and pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act
(or any successor rule then in effect) and shall effect any related
qualification or compliance as would permit or facilitate the sale and
distribution of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities owned by the
Holders, including by naming such Holders as selling securityholders, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Resale
Registration Statement to become effective under the Act no later than the
first date Registrable Securities may be sold by any OnCore Holder under its
Lock-Up Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Resale
Registration Statement continuously effective under the Act in order to permit
the prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by the Holders until the
date as of which there are no Registrable Securities outstanding and in no
event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of the Act
and Rule 174 thereunder. During the period that the Resale Registration
Statement is effective, the Company shall supplement the prospectus contained
in the Resale Registration Statement or make amendments to the Resale
Registration Statement (whether or not required by the form on which the
Registrable Securities are being registered), if required by the Act or if
requested by any Holder, including to reflect any specific plan of
distribution or method of sale, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have any such amendments declared effective as soon as practicable after
filing.

  

  

(c) At any time and from time to time after the Resale Registration Statement
has been declared effective by the Commission, any one or more Holders of
Registrable Securities that in the aggregate hold at least 40% of the then
total outstanding Registrable Securities may request to sell all or any
portion of their Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering (including
an "at-the-market offering" or a "registered direct offering") that is
registered pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement (each, an
"Underwritten Shelf Takedown"); provided that in the case of any such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown such Holder or Holders will be entitled to make
such demand only if the total offering price to the public of the Registrable
Securities to be sold in such offering is reasonably expected to exceed
$20,000,000 in the aggregate. The Company shall, within five (5) days of the
receipt of such demand, give written notice thereof to all other Holders, and
shall include in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown all Registrable Securities
with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion
therein within ten (10) Business Days after sending such written notice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or take any action to
effect, an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to this Section 1.2:

  

  

(i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the Holders;

  

  

(ii) if such Underwritten Shelf Takedown would be priced within less than
ninety (90) days after the pricing of a previous Underwritten Shelf Takedown
or a Piggy-Back Underwritten Offering; and

  

  

(iii) if the Company has already effected two (2) Underwritten Shelf Takedowns
in the preceding twelve (12) months.

  

  

(e) All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
underwriting by a majority in interest of participating Holders (which
underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1.2, if the underwriter
advises the Company that marketing factors require a limitation on the number
of securities to be underwritten, then the Company shall so advise all Holders
participating in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown, and the number of shares
that may be included therein shall be allocated to the Holders pro rata based
on the number of Registrable Securities held by all such Holders. In no event
shall any Registrable Securities held by Holders be excluded from such
underwriting unless all other securities are first excluded.

  

  

1.3 Request for Registration.

  

  

(a) Subject to the conditions of this Section 1.3, if the Company shall
receive at any time a written request from the Holders (for purposes of this
Section 1.3, the "Initiating Holders") holding forty percent percent (40%) or
more of the Registrable Securities then outstanding that the Company file a
registration statement under the Act covering the registration of Registrable
Securities with an aggregate offering price to the public that is reasonably
expected to exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) holding seventy-five
percent (75%) or more of the Registrable Securities then outstanding that the
Company file a registration statement under the Act covering the registration
of Registrable Securities with an aggregate offering price to the public that
is reasonably expected to exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate, then the
Company shall, within five (5) days of the receipt thereof, give written
notice of such request to all Holders, and subject to the limitations of this
Section 1.3, use all reasonable best efforts to effect, as soon as
practicable, the registration under the Act of all Registrable Securities that
the Holders request to be registered in a written request received by the
Company within ten (10) Business Days of the mailing of the Company's notice
pursuant to this Section 1.3(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities
covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the
Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 1.3, and the
Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in
Section 1.3(a). In such event, the right of any Holder to include its
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
Holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's
Registrable Securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed
by a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders and such Holder) to the
extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities
through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
underwriting by a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders (which
underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1.3, if the underwriter
advises the Company that marketing factors require a limitation on the number
of securities underwritten (including Registrable Securities), then the
Company shall so advise all Holders holding Registrable Securities that would
otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares that may
be included in the underwriting shall be allocated to the Holders holding such
Registrable Securities pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by all such Holders (including the Initiating Holders). In no event shall
any Registrable Securities held by Holders be excluded from such underwriting
unless all other securities are first excluded. Any Registrable Securities
excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from the
registration.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to effect
a registration pursuant to this Section 1.3:

  

  

(i) after the Company has effected three (3) registrations pursuant to this
Section 1.3, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective;

  

  

(ii) if the Registration Statement would become effective prior to the first
date Registrable Securities may be sold by any OnCore Holder under the Lock-Up
Agreement;

  

  

(iii) if the Registration Statement would be filed less than ninety (90) days
after the pricing of an Underwritten Shelf Takedown or a Piggy-Back
Underwritten Offering; or

  

  

(iv) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of Registrable Securities
that are registered on the Resale Registration Statement and such Resale
Registration Statement is effective and available for such proposed offering
by the Holders.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

1.4 Company Registration.

  

  

(a) Other than in connection with a request for registration pursuant to
Section 1.2 or 1.3 of this Agreement and other than in the case of an Excluded
Registration, if at any time the Company proposes to file (i) a prospectus
supplement to an effective shelf registration statement (a "Shelf Registration
Statement"), or (ii) a registration statement other than a Shelf Registration
Statement for a delayed or continuous offering pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act, in either case, for the sale of Common Stock for its own
account, or for the benefit of the holders of any of its securities other than
the Holders, to an underwriter on a firm commitment basis for reoffering to
the public or in a "bought deal" or "registered direct offering" with one or
more investment banks (collectively, a "Piggy-Back Underwritten Offering"),
then as soon as practicable but not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
filing of (a) any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to such Piggy-
Back Underwritten Offering pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act,
(b) any prospectus supplement relating to such Piggy-Back Underwritten
Offering pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (if no preliminary
prospectus supplement is used) or (c) such Shelf Registration Statement, as
the case may be, the Company shall give notice of such proposed Piggy-Back
Underwritten Offering to the Holders and such notice (a "Piggyback Notice")
shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in such Piggy-Back
Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities as each such
Holder may request in writing. Each such Holder shall then have ten (10)
Business Days after receiving such notice to request in writing to the Company
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Piggy-Back Underwritten Offering,
except that such Holder shall have three (3) days after such Holder confirms
receipt of the notice to request inclusion of Registrable Securities in the
Piggy Back Underwritten Offering in the case of a "bought deal," "registered
direct offering" or "overnight transaction" where no preliminary prospectus is
used. Upon receipt of any such request for inclusion from a Holder received
within the specified time, the Company shall include in the Piggy Back
Underwritten Offering any of the Holders' Registrable Securities requested to
be included on the terms set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the
commencement of any "road show," any Holder shall have the right to withdraw
its request for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any registration by
giving written notice to the Company of its request to withdraw and such
withdrawal shall be irrevocable and, after making such withdrawal, such Holder
shall no longer have any right to include Registrable Securities in the Piggy-
Back Underwritten Offering as to which such withdrawal was made.

  

  

(b) If the Company does not qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer (within
the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (a "WKSI"), (i) the Company
shall give each Holder fifteen (15) days' notice prior to filing a Shelf
Registration Statement and, upon the written request of any Holder, received
by the Company within ten (10) days of such notice to the Holder, the Company
shall include in such Shelf Registration Statement a number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of Registrable Securities requested
to be included without naming any requesting Holder as a selling shareholder
and including only a generic description of the holder of such securities (the
"Undesignated Registrable Securities"), (ii) the Company shall not be required
to give notice to any Holder in connection with a filing pursuant to Section
1.4(a) unless such Holder provided such notice to the Company pursuant to this
Section 1.4(b) and included Undesignated Registrable Securities in the Shelf
Registration Statement related to such filing, and (iii) at the written
request of a Holder given to the Company more than seven (7) days before the
date specified in writing by the Company as the Company's good faith estimate
of a launch of a Piggy-Back Underwritten Offering (or such shorter period to
which the Company in its sole discretion consents), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any of the Holders'
Undesignated Registrable Securities so requested to be included and shall file
a post-effective amendment or, if available, a prospectus supplement to a
Shelf Registration Statement to include such Undesignated Registrable
Securities as any Holder may request.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Right to Terminate Registration. The Company shall have the right to
terminate or withdraw any registration or offering initiated by it under this
Section 1.4 before the effective date of such registration or the completion
of such offering, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable
Securities in such registration or offering. The expenses of such withdrawn
registration or offering shall be borne by the Company in accordance with
Section 1.8.

  

  

(d) Underwriting Requirements. All Holders proposing to include their
securities in any Piggyback Underwritten Offering shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 1.4, if the underwriter advises the Company that marketing
factors require a limitation on the number of securities to be underwritten,
then the Company shall so advise all Holders participating in the Piggyback
Underwritten Offering, and the number of securities that may be included
therein shall be allocated to the Holders pro rata based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by all such Holders, provided that, in no event
shall any Registrable Securities held by Holders be excluded from such
underwriting unless all other securities are first excluded other than
securities proposed to be included by the Company and, provided further, that
in no event shall the amount of securities of the selling Holders included in
the offering be reduced below twenty percent (20%) of the total amount of
securities included in such offering.

  

  

1.5 Suspension of Offers, Sales and Dispositions of Registrable Securities
Under Registration Statement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

If the Company shall furnish at any time to Holders of Registrable Securities
seeking to effect and Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to Section 1.2 or
seeking the filing of a registration statement or offering pursuant to Section
1.3, a certificate signed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chairman
of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board, it would be
seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for a registration
statement to be filed or for offers and sales or other dispositions of
Registrable Securities to continue under any registration statement, the
Company may delay such filing or restrict such offers and sales or other
dispositions of Registrable Securities for a reasonable period of time not to
exceed ninety (90) days, and a Holder will not be permitted to offer or sell
or otherwise dispose of Registrable Securities, by delivering a written notice
(a "Suspension Notice") to all such Holders (such delivery shall be made to
such Holders' address set forth opposite each such Holders' name on Schedule
A) stating that a delay in the offer and sale or other disposition of
Registrable Securities is necessary due to such a finding by the Board,
provided that (1) such right may not be exercised with respect to the filing
of the Resale Registration Statement, (2) such right shall be exercised by the
Company not more than once in any twelve (12) month period, (3) all executive
officers and directors of the Company shall also be prohibited from selling
securities of the Company during any such period other than pursuant to Rule
10b5-1 trading plans previously adopted by such individuals prior to such
suspension in the offer, sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities, and (4) the Company shall not register or sell any securities for
the account of itself or any other stockholder during such period (other than
a registration relating solely to the sale of securities of participants in a
Company stock plan (including any stock plan assumed by the Company in
connection with a merger or similar transaction), or a registration in which
the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of debt securities that are also being registered). Promptly
following the cessation or discontinuance of the facts and circumstances
forming the basis for any Suspension Notice, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to amend such registration statement and/or amend or
supplement the related prospectus included therein to the extent necessary,
and take all other actions reasonably necessary, to allow the offer and sale
or other disposition of Registrable Securities to recommence as promptly as
possible, and promptly notify all Holders in writing when such offers and
sales or other dispositions of Registrable Securities under such registration
statement may recommence. Upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, Holders shall
immediately suspend their use of such registration statement and any
prospectus included therein or forming a part thereof to offer and sell or
otherwise dispose of Registrable Securities, and shall not offer or sell or
otherwise dispose of Registrable Securities under such registration statement
or any prospectus included therein or forming a part thereof until receipt of
a notice from the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence that offers and
sales or other dispositions of Registrable Securities may recommence. Holders
shall keep the fact that the Company has delivered a Suspension Notice and any
non-public information provided by the Company in connection therewith
strictly confidential, shall not disclose or reveal the Suspension Notice or
any such information to any person or entity and shall not use such
information for securities trading or any other purpose.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

1.6 Obligations of the Company. Whenever required under this Section 1 to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as
expeditiously as reasonably possible:

  

  

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to
such Registrable Securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective, and keep such registration
statement effective until the distribution contemplated in the registration
statement has been completed and prepare and file with the SEC such amendments
and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with
the provisions of the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities
covered by such registration statement; provided that before filing a
registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto
or any Free Writing Prospectuses related thereto, the Company will furnish to
one counsel selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities included in such registration statement or offering copies of all
such documents proposed to be filed which documents shall be subject to the
review and comment of such counsel, and include in any registration statement
such additional information reasonably requested by the holders of a majority
of the Registrable Securities registered under the applicable registration
statement, or the underwriters, if any, for marketing purposes, whether or not
required by applicable securities laws;

  

  

(b) if requested by the managing underwriters (if any) or the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding Registrable Securities included in such
registration statement or offering, as applicable, promptly include in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the
managing underwriters (if any) or such holders may reasonably request in order
to permit the intended method of distribution of such securities and make all
required filings of such prospectus supplement or such post-effective
amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has received such request;

  

  

(c) furnish without charge to the Holders of Registrable Securities included
in such registration such number of copies of a prospectus, including a
preliminary prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus, in conformity with the
requirements of the Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned
by them;

  

  

(d) use commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities
covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky
laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders
included in such registration, provided that the Company shall not be required
in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or
to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or
jurisdictions unless the Company is already subject to service in such
jurisdiction;

  

  

(e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform
its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing underwriter of such offering, provided that the Holders
selling Registrable Securities in such underwritten public offering are
entering into the same underwriting agreement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) notify each seller of such Registrable Securities, (i) promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the date and time when such registration statement
and each post-effective amendment thereto has become effective or a prospectus
or supplement to any prospectus relating to a registration statement has been
filed and when any registration or qualification has become effective under a
state securities or blue sky law or any exemption thereunder has been
obtained, (ii) promptly after receipt thereof, of any request by the SEC or
any state securities authority for the amendment or supplementing of such
registration statement or prospectus or for additional information, (iii)
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the SEC or any
state securities authority of any stop order suspending such registration
statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) promptly
after receipt thereof, of any notification with respect to the suspension of
qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or
the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose and (v) promptly at any time
when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Act
that includes the happening of any event the result of which the prospectus
included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and, at the request of any such seller, the Company will promptly
prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made;

  

  

(g) cause all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section 1 to
be listed on a national exchange or trading system and on each securities
exchange and trading system on which similar securities issued by the Company
are then listed;

  

  

(h) enter into and perform such customary agreements (including underwriting
agreements in customary form, which agreements include customary limitations
on the liability of the holders of Registrable Securities) and take all such
other actions as holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being
sold, or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities (including, without
limitation, using reasonable best efforts to have officers and senior
management of the Company and its subsidiaries, participate in "road shows,"
analyst and investor presentations and marketing events);

  

  

(i) promptly make available at reasonable times for inspection by any seller
of Registrable Securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition
pursuant to such registration statement and any attorney, accountant or other
agent retained by any such seller or underwriter, all financial and other
records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and
cause the Company's officers, directors, employees and independent accountants
to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller,
underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such
registration statement subject to the applicable person(s) executing a
nondisclosure agreement in reasonable form and substance if reasonably
required by the Company;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

(j) permit any holder of Registrable Securities who, in its sole and exclusive
judgment, might be deemed to be an underwriter or a person who controls the
Company within the meaning of the Act (a "controlling Person") of the Company,
to participate in the preparation of such registration or comparable statement
and to require the insertion therein of material, furnished to the Company in
writing, which in the reasonable judgment of such holder and its counsel
should be included;

  

  

(k) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or of any
order suspending or preventing the use of any related prospectus or suspending
the qualification of any Registrable Securities included in such registration
statement for sale in any jurisdiction, and in the event of the issuance of
any such stop order or other such order the Company shall advise such holders
of Registrable Securities of such stop order or other such order promptly
after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof and shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain the withdrawal of such order;

  

  

(l) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by
such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable
the sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

  

  

(m) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a "comfort" letter from the
Company's independent public accountants in customary form, addressed to each
of the underwriters, as applicable, and covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by "comfort" letters as the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities being sold, or managing underwriters reasonably
request;

  

  

(n) provide a legal opinion of the Company's outside counsel addressed to the
Company and the holders of Registrable Securities, dated the effective date of
such registration statement (and, if such registration includes an
underwritten public offering, dated the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement), with respect to the registration statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included therein (including
the preliminary prospectus) and such other documents relating thereto in
customary form, and reasonably acceptable to the managing underwriters, and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by legal opinions of
such nature;

  

  

(o) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist in any filings
required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
("FINRA"); and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

(p) take such other actions and deliver such other documents and instruments
as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the registration and disposition
of Registrable Securities as contemplated hereby.

  

  

If any such registration or comparable statement refers to any Holder by name
or otherwise as the Holder of any securities of the Company and if, in its
sole and exclusive judgment, such Holder is or might be deemed to be a
controlling Person of the Company, such Holder shall have the right to require
(i) the insertion therein of language, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such Holder and presented to the Company in writing, to the
effect that the holding by such Holder of such securities is not to be
construed as a recommendation by such Holder of the investment quality of the
Company's securities covered thereby and that such holding does not imply that
such Holder will assist in meeting any future financial requirements of the
Company or (ii) in the event that such reference to such Holder by name or
otherwise is not required by the Act or any similar federal statute then in
force, the deletion of the reference to such Holder.

  

  

1.7 Information from Holder. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Section 1 with
respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder
shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the
Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of
such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of
such Holder's Registrable Securities.

  

  

1.8 Expenses of Registration. All expenses (other than underwriting discounts
and commissions and stock transfer taxes applicable to the securities
registered by the Holders) incurred in connection with registrations, filings
or qualifications pursuant to Sections 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, including (without
limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and
accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the
reasonable and customary fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling
Holders not to exceed $50,000 for each registration or underwritten offering
shall be borne by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding
or offering begun pursuant to Section 1.2 or Section 1.3 if the registration
or offering request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered or sold in such
offering (in which case all participating Holders shall bear such expenses pro
rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities that were to be included
in the withdrawn registration), unless, in the case of a registration
requested under Section 1.3, the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities agree to forfeit their right to one demand registration pursuant to
Section 1.3; provided, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the
Holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business
or prospects of the Company from that known to the Holders at the time of
their request and have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness
following disclosure by the Company of such material adverse change, then the
Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain
their rights pursuant to Sections 1.2 and 1.3 without any such forfeiture.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

1.9 Delay of Registration. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an
injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the
result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation
or implementation of this Section 1.

  

  

1.10 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in
a registration statement under this Section 1:

  

  

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder, the partners, members, managers, officers, directors and
stockholders of each Holder, legal counsel, accountants and investment
advisors for each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the Act) for such
Holder and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within
the meaning of the Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Act,
the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Act, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of
the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "Violation")
(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained or incorporated by reference in such registration statement,
including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or Free Writing
Prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, any
issuer information (as defined in Rule 433 of the Act) incident to such
registration prepared by or on behalf of the Company or used or referred to by
the Company, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in such
registration statement a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any violation
or alleged violation by the Company of the Act, the 1934 Act, any state
securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934
Act or any state securities laws, and the Company will reimburse each such
Holder, underwriter, controlling Person or other aforementioned person for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action
as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this subsection 1.10(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, nor shall the
Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability
or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation
that occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such
Holder or underwriter. The Company shall reimburse such holder, partners,
members, director, officer or controlling Person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Holder, partner, member, manager,
officer, director and stockholder of such Holder, legal counsel, accountant
and investment advisor in connection with the investigation or defense of such
loss, claim, damage, liability or expense.

  

  

(b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not
jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors,
each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each
controlling Person, legal counsel and accountants for the Company, any
underwriter, any other Holder selling securities in such registration
statement and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Holder,
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which
any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the Act, the 1934 Act,
any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act,
the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are
based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent)
that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such
registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any person intended to be
indemnified pursuant to this subsection 1.10(b) for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating
or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such
expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this subsection 1.10(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, and provided that in
no event shall any indemnity under this subsection 1.10(b) when taken together
with any contribution under subsection 1.10(d) exceed the net proceeds from
the offering received by such Holder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 1.10 of
notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action)
for which a party may be entitled to indemnification, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying
party under this Section 1.10, deliver to the indemnifying party a written
notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party but the failure
so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability
under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent such action and such
failure results in material prejudice to the indemnifying party and forfeiture
by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will
not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any
indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in
paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however,
that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that
may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to
retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the
indemnifying party, if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party
to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict
of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any
such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party
shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 1.10 is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with
respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations; provided, however, that (i) no contribution by any Holder,
when combined with any amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to Section
1.10(b), shall exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such
Holder and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The relative
fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  

  

(e) No indemnifying party shall, except with the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
unless such judgment or settlement (i) includes as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation, and (ii)
does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or
a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

  

  

(f) The indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement
shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification and contribution
that any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.

  

  

(g) The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 1.10 shall
survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a
registration statement under this Section 1 and otherwise.

  

  

1.11 Reports Under the 1934 Act. With a view to making available to the
Holders the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC
that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the
public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the
Company agrees to:

  

  

(a) make and keep current public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times after the date of this
Agreement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Act and the 1934 Act; and

  

  

(c) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable
Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that
it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Act and the
1934 Act, or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold
pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the
most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports
and documents so filed by the Company and (iii) such other information as may
be reasonably requested to avail any Holder of any rule or regulation of the
SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration or
pursuant to such form.

  

  

The Company shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable
Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such holder of Registrable Securities to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Act within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by (A) Rule 144 or (B) any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC.

  

  

1.12 Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to
register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 1 may be assigned
(but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or
assignee of such securities that (i) is a subsidiary, parent, partner, former
partner, limited partner, retired partner, member, former member, stockholder,
former stockholder or affiliate of a Holder (including, in the case of a
venture capital, private equity or similar investment fund, another fund
affiliated with or under common investment management with such fund), (ii) is
a Holder's family member or trust for the benefit of an individual Holder or
(iii) after such assignment or transfer, holds (together with its affiliates
and other entities that share a common investment advisor with such transferee
or assignee) at least 3% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock,
provided: (a) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer,
furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or
assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are
being assigned; (b) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound
by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the provisions of Section 1.14 below; and (c) such
assignment shall be effective only if immediately following such transfer the
further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is
restricted under the Act.

  

  

1.13 Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights. From and after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Holders holding a majority of the then outstanding Registrable Securities,
enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any
securities of the Company that would allow such holder or prospective holder
(a) to include any of such securities in any registration statement filed
under Section 1.2, Section 1.3 or Section 1.4 hereof, unless under the terms
of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such
securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of
such securities will not reduce the amount of the Registrable Securities of
the Holders that are included or (b) to demand registration of their
securities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

1.14 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement.

  

  

(a) In connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to Sections 1.2, 1.3
or 1.4 hereof, upon the request of the Company or the managing underwriters of
such public offering (a "Public Offering"), no Holder of Registrable
Securities shall effect any sale of the Company's equity securities during the
period beginning on the most recent effective date of the registration
statement relating to such underwritten registration and through the date that
is no longer than ninety (90) days after the effective date of such public
offering (each, a "Follow-on Holdback Period"), except as part of such Public
Offering provided that nothing herein shall prevent a Holder from transferring
Registrable Securities to pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.12(i)
hereof. Each Holder's agreement to not sell any of the Company's equity
securities during the Follow-on Holdback Period in connection with a Public
Offering shall be subject to and conditioned upon the executive officers and
directors of the Company entering into an agreement on substantially the same
terms relating to such Public Offering. The Follow-on Holdback Period may be
extended for no longer than thirty-five (35) days as requested by the Company
or the managing underwriters to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (A) the
publication or other distribution of research reports and (B) analyst
recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions
contained in FINRA Rule 2711(f)(4) or NYSE Rule 472(f)(4), or any successor
provisions or amendments thereto (such period referred to herein as the
"Holdback Extension"). The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with
respect to the Company's equity securities (or other securities) subject to
the foregoing restriction until the end of such period, including any period
of Holdback Extension.

  

  

(b) The Company (i) shall not effect any public sale or distribution of its
equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for such securities, during the seven (7) days prior to and during
such period of time as in either case may be determined by the underwriters
managing the underwritten registration following the most recent effective
date of any underwritten registration pursuant to Sections 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4
hereof (not to exceed ninety (90) days, except as extended during the period
of any Holdback Extension), except as part of such underwritten registration
or pursuant to registrations on Form S-8, Form S-4 or in either case any
successor form and unless the underwriters managing the registered public
offering otherwise agree in writing, and (ii) shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each director and executive officer to agree not to effect
any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) of any
such securities during such period (as extended by any Holdback Extension),
except as part of such underwritten registration, if otherwise permitted,
unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise
agree in writing.

  

  

(c) Except as provided below in this Section 1.14(c), any discretionary waiver
or termination of the restrictions of any or all of the agreements referenced
in Section 1.14(a) or Section 1.14(b) above by the Company or the managing
underwriters shall apply to all Holders subject to such restrictions pro rata
based on the number of shares subject to such restrictions, except that the
managing underwriters may, in their sole discretion, release up to an
aggregate of 100,000 shares (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations or the like) subject to the restrictions
in Section 1.14(a) or Section 1.14(b), as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

2. MISCELLANEOUS.

  

  

2.1 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms and

Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

2.4 Titles and Subtitles. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are
used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or

2.5 Notices. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon
personal delivery to the party to be notified; (b) when sent by confirmed

2.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, if any) constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the parties with regard to the subjects
hereof and thereof. Subject to Section 1.13, any term of this Agreement may be
amended and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either
generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) only with the written consent of the Company and the holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities. Any amendment or waiver effected in
accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon each holder of any
Registrable Securities, each future holder of all such Registrable Securities,
and the Company.

  

  

2.8 Severability. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be
unenforceable under applicable law, such provision(s) shall be excluded from
this Agreement and the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
such provision(s) were so excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with
its terms.

  

  

2.9 Aggregation of Stock. All Registrable Securities held or acquired by
affiliated entities (including affiliated investment funds or other entities
under common investment management) or persons sharing a common investment
advisor shall be aggregated together for the purpose of determining the
availability of any rights under this Agreement.

  

  

2.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto recognize and agree that money
damages may be insufficient to compensate the holders of any Registrable
Securities for breaches by the Company of the terms hereof and, consequently,
that the equitable remedy of specific performance of the terms hereof will be
available in the event of any such breach.

GOVERNANCE MATTERS

  

  

A. Board

  

  

    

1.

In compliance with the Articles and concurrently with the completion of the
Merger, the Company has caused two (2) individuals designated by the
Shareholder (the "Shareholder Designees") to be appointed to the Board.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

2.

  |  

At the annual general or special meeting of the Company's shareholders held
immediately following the effective date hereof at which directors of the
Company are elected, the Company will put forward for nomination for election
to the Board the Shareholder Designees. At each subsequent annual general or
special meeting of the Company's shareholders thereafter the Company will put
forward for nomination those Shareholder Designees that the Shareholder is
entitled to nominate pursuant to the Articles (who need not be the same
individuals as the Shareholder Designees appointed to the Board pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) but shall be those individuals set out as RS Nominated
Directors pursuant to a Nomination Notice as those terms are defined in the
Articles), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain shareholder
approval for the election of the Shareholder Designees at such meetings
(including by soliciting proxies in favour of the Shareholder Designees) and
to that end will support the Shareholder Designees for election in a manner no
less rigorous or favourable than the manner in which the Company supports any
of its other nominees.

3.

The Company shall provide advance notice to the Shareholder of any upcoming
shareholders' meetings in accordance with Part 28 of the Articles.

4.

In the event that any Shareholder Designee resigns, dies, becomes
incapacitated or otherwise ceases to be a director prior to the expiration of
his or her term as a director, such vacancy shall be filled in accordance with
the provisions of section 5 of Part 28 of the Articles. The Company shall use
all commercially reasonable steps, promptly upon receipt by it of a written
notice from the Shareholder identifying a Shareholder Designee to fill such
vacancy and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following
receipt of such written notice, as are necessary to call a meeting of the
board of directors to vote on the appointment of such Shareholder Designee to
fill such vacancy (or to obtain a vote of the directors by way of unanimous
written resolution) and take all such other steps as are required by the
Articles and the Act with respect to such appointment.

Shareholder Designee pursuant to the Articles and provided that the Company is
in material compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Articles, the
Shareholder will vote, and will cause its Affiliates to vote, all of the
Shares then owned by the Shareholder and its Affiliates:

  

  

    

1.

in favour of:

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and, in each case, the
Shareholder is required to either account for its investment in the Company
under the equity method of accounting or include separate financial statements
of the Company in any filing with the Securities Exchange Commission by the
Shareholder, then the Company agrees to timely provide such information that
the Shareholder reasonably requests in connection the Shareholder\'s

V.

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

A. PFIC Status

  

For so long as the Shareholder owns stock of the Company, the Company will use
its reasonable efforts to avoid, in respect of any taxable year, being treated
as a passive foreign investment company ("PFIC") within the meaning of Section
1297 of the Code, including, but not limited to, causing a Subsidiary to file
an election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3. No later than
75 days after the end of each taxable year, the Company shall deliver to the
Shareholder an analysis as to whether the Company believes that it will be
treated as a PFIC in respect of such taxable year. Such analysis may be
prepared by the Company, but in preparing such analysis the Company shall
consult with its internationally recognized tax advisors.

  

  

B. Classification of the Merger

  

  

    

1.

  |  

Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of the Company and Owl (i) shall report the
Merger on their Tax Returns as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) shall, to the extent required, report the
Merger on their Tax Returns as not being subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the
Code as a result of the operation of Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c), (iii) shall not take any inconsistent position with the
foregoing on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Tax authority or
other tribunal, and (iv) shall not take any action, cause or permit any action
to be taken or fail to take any action, that would cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" described in Section 368(a) of the Code or that
would cause the Merger to be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

    

2.

  |  

The Company shall cause Owl to comply with the reporting requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6) applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereunder, and any other reporting requirements applicable to a
tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Code or the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

3.

  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.2, neither the
Company nor Owl will be required to comply with the undertakings set forth in
Section 5.2(a) or (b) unless: (i) the shareholders of Owl immediately prior to
the completion of the Merger have provided the Company or Owl, as applicable,
with the information relating to such shareholders that is necessary for the
Company or Owl, as applicable, (A) to establish the requirements set forth in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(i) and (B) to comply with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), and (ii) with respect to the
application of Sections 5.2(a) and (b) to a shareholder of Owl immediately
prior to the completion of the Merger, if that shareholder is a "five-percent
transferee shareholder" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such shareholder has entered into the five-year
agreement referenced in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

C. QEF Information

  

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to use its commercially reasonably
efforts to provide, to the Shareholder all information that may be necessary
to allow the Shareholder, and direct or indirect owners of the Shareholder, to
evaluate the analysis referenced in Section 5.1 and to fulfill their U.S. tax
filing and reporting obligations. The Company shall provide, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to provide, such information to the Shareholder as
direct and indirect owners of the Shareholder may reasonably require to timely
file and maintain a "qualified electing fund" election (as defined in Section
1295(a) of the Code) with respect to any such entity.

REPRESENTATION LETTER

  

  

This Representation Letter, dated as of _______________, 2015, is being
delivered to Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a British Columbia
corporation (the "Company"), by __________________________________ (the
"Stockholder") in connection with that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of _________________, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among the
Company, OnCore Biopharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("OnCore"), and TKM
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to
which Merger Sub will be merged with and into OnCore, with OnCore surviving as
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger"). In connection with
the Merger, the Stockholder will receive shares of the Company's common stock
(the "Company Securities") at the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and such
Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to the Company as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing as follows:

  


 

  

I. AUTHORITY AND RELIANCE. I REPRESENT THAT I HAVE FULL POWER AND AUTHORITY TO
EXECUTE THIS LETTER AND MAKE THE REPRESENTATIONS CONTAINED HEREIN, WITHOUT
OBTAINING THE APPROVAL OR CONSENT OF ANY OTHER PERSON. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE
COMPANY IS RELYING ON THIS STATEMENT IN ISSUING ME THE COMPANY SECURITIES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DULY AND VALIDLY EXECUTED
AND DELIVERED BY ME AND CONSTITUTES A LEGAL, VALID AND BINDING OBLIGATION OF
SUCH MINE, ENFORCEABLE AGAINST ME IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS.

  

  

II. ACQUIRED ENTIRELY FOR OWN ACCOUNT. I AM ACQUIRING THE COMPANY SECURITIES
FOR INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD FOR MY OWN ACCOUNT, NOT AS A NOMINEE
OR AGENT, AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF ANY PART THEREOF,
AND I HAVE NO PRESENT INTENTION OF SELLING, GRANTING PARTICIPATION IN, OR
OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTING THE SAME. I FURTHER REPRESENT THAT I DO NOT HAVE ANY
CONTRACT, UNDERTAKING OR ARRANGEMENT WITH ANY PERSON TO SELL, TRANSFER OR
GRANT PARTICIPATION TO SUCH PERSON OR TO ANY THIRD PERSON, WITH RESPECT TO ANY
OF THE COMPANY SECURITIES.

  

  

III. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER
AGREEMENT) IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER. I HAVE ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
ASK QUESTIONS OF AND RECEIVE ANSWERS FROM THE COMPANY REGARDING THE COMPANY,
ITS BUSINESS AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
COMPANY SECURITIES. I BELIEVE I HAVE RECEIVED ALL THE INFORMATION I CONSIDER
NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE THE MERGER AND
ACQUIRE THE COMPANY SECURITIES.

  

  

IV. SECURITIES LAWS. I UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY SECURITIES ARE "RESTRICTED
SECURITIES" WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND WILL BE FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL SECURITIES
LAWS AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS, AND THAT SUCH COMPANY SECURITIES MAY NOT BE
RESOLD WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT, EXCEPT IN CERTAIN LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THIS CONNECTION, I REPRESENT THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH RULE
144 AS PRESENTLY IN EFFECT, AND I UNDERSTAND THE RESALE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED
THEREBY AND BY THE ACT.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

V. ACCREDITED INVESTOR. I AM AN "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" (AS DEFINED IN RULE
501(A) OF REGULATION D PROMULGATED UNDER THE ACT).

  

  

VI. TRANSFERS. I WILL NOT SELL, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF OR
ENCUMBER ANY OF THE COMPANY SECURITIES I RECEIVES UNLESS AND UNTIL (A) SUCH
SHARES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT AND EACH APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAW; OR (B) (I) AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE
THEREUNDER, AND (II) I HAVE NOTIFIED THE COMPANY OF THE PROPOSED TRANSFER AND
HAVE FURNISHED THE COMPANY WITH AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH TRANSFER WILL NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION OF SUCH SHARES
UNDER THE ACT.

  

  

VII. INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. I AM ABLE TO FEND FOR MYSELF, CAN BEAR THE
ECONOMIC RISK OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY AND HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE AND
EXPERIENCE IN FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS MATTERS THAT I AM CAPABLE OF EVALUATING
THE MERITS AND RISKS OF ACQUIRING THE COMPANY SECURITIES.

  

  

VIII. NO GENERAL SOLICITATION OR ADVERTISING. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM NOT
ACQUIRING THE COMPANY SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF ANY "GENERAL SOLICITATION" OR
"GENERAL ADVERTISING," AS SUCH TERMS ARE USED IN REGULATION D UNDER THE ACT,
INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S REGISTRATION STATEMENTS OR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC
OR SEDAR, ADVERTISEMENTS, ARTICLES, NOTICES OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PUBLISHED
IN ANY NEWSPAPER, MAGAZINE OR SIMILAR MEDIA OR BROADCAST OVER RADIO OR
TELEVISION, OR ANY SEMINAR OR MEETING WHOSE ATTENDEES HAVE BEEN INVITED BY
GENERAL SOLICITATION OR GENERAL ADVERTISING.

  

  

IX. LEGENDS. I AUTHORIZE THE COMPANY AND ITS AGENTS TO PLACE ON THE
CERTIFICATES FOR THE COMPANY SECURITIES LEGENDS STATING THAT SUCH COMPANY
SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAW
AND SETTING FORTH THE AFOREMENTIONED RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER, INCLUDING ONE
OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING LEGENDS:

  

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE
SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED, OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED UNLESS REGISTERED OR QUALIFIED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE
ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY TO BUYER IS OBTAINED BY THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE STATING
THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE, ASSIGNMENT, PLEDGE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM SUCH
REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION."

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Representation Letter as
of the date set forth below.

convertible into, or exchangeable for, Company Shares;

  

  

"Company Shares" means the common shares in the capital of the Company as

Election of Directors

  

  

1. For so long as Roivant Sciences Ltd. ((the "Nominating Shareholder" or "RS") has "beneficial ownership" (as defined pursuant Rule 13d-3 under the United States, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) ("Beneficial Ownership") owns or exercises control or direction over not less than:

  

  

(a) twenty- percent (20%) of the issued and outstanding Company Shares

right to nominate two (2) individuals for election to the board of directors
of the Company at each Shareholder Meeting; and

  

  

(b ) ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding Company Shares Calculated
on an Undiluted Basis as at the Record Date Notice, RS has the right to
nominate one (1) individual for election to the board of directors of the
Company at each Shareholder Meeting,

  

  

    

  |  

(where such designee directors are referred to as the "RS Nominated
Directors").

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

2. Upon the Nominating Shareholder having Beneficial Ownership or exercising control or direction over less than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding Company Shares Calculated on an Undiluted Basis as at the Record Date Notice, the nomination rights provided under Section 1 will be of no further force and effect.

  

  

Number of Directors

  

  

3. For so long as the Nominating Shareholder has a right to nominate one or more directors under Section 1 of this Part 28, the number of directors of the Company shall not exceed seven (7) directors without the prior written consent of the Nominating Shareholder.

  

  

Nomination Procedure

  

  

    

4.

  |  

For so long as the Nominating Shareholder has a right to nominate one or more
directors under Section 1 of this Part 28:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

No earlier than ninety (90) days and no later than sixty (60) days prior to
the date of each Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall notify RS in writing
of the date of the Shareholder Meeting (the "Company Notice"). The Company
Notice shall specify the total number of Company Shares issued and outstanding
Calculated on an Undiluted Basis as at the Record Date Notice.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

RS shall have the right and option, exercisable within fifteen (15) days from
receipt of the Company Notice (the "Nomination Right Notice Period") by
written notice to the Company (the "Nomination Notice") to exercise the
Nomination Right. If RS wishes to exercise the Nomination Right, RS must
specify in the Nomination Notice (i) the number of Company Shares beneficially
owned by the Nominating Shareholder as at the date of the Nomination Notice,
(ii) the name of the individual(s) RS wishes to nominate for election to the
board of directors of the Company, and (iii) confirm that the nominee(s) are
eligible to act as director(s) under the Act or, if the Company is otherwise
governed by another statue or regime, that the nominee(s) are eligible to act
as a director under such statute or regime. As soon as reasonably possible
after the request by the Company, duly completed forms and any other
information in respect of the RS Nominated Directors, as required by the
relevant stock exchange, shall be provided by the RS Nominated Directors.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

    

(c)

  |  

If RS fails to deliver a Nomination Notice in response to a Company Notice
within the Nomination Right Notice Period, then the Company will not be
required to nominate individuals identified by RS for election to the board of
directors of the Company at the Shareholder Meeting with respect to which RS
failed to deliver the Nomination Notice, and RS shall have the right to
nominate person(s) for election to the board of directors of the Company at
the next Shareholder Meeting in accordance with this Part 28.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

If RS delivers a Nomination Notice in response to a Company Notice within the
Nomination Right Notice Period then, subject only to the nominee(s) identified
in the Nomination Notice being eligible to act as director(s) of the Company,
the Company shall (i) nominate the RS nominee(s) to stand for election to the
board of directors of the Company at the Shareholder Meeting, and (ii) solicit
proxies from the holders of Company Shares in respect thereof which will be
satisfied by delivery of a form of proxy to the holders of Company Shares
following standard procedures consistent with past practice. For greater
certainty, the Company (x) shall not be required to retain a third party
solicitation agent, and (y) shall include the name of the RS nominee(s) to
stand for election to the board of directors of the Company in the proxy to be
delivered to each holder of Company Shares in respect of the Shareholder
Meeting. The Nominating Shareholder shall also provide to the Company such
other information regarding the RS nominee(s) as may be reasonably requested
by the Company so as to comply with applicable proxy disclosure requirements
under applicable securities laws, together with such other information,
including a biography of the RS Nominated Directors, that is consistent with
the information the Company intends to publish about management nominees as
directors of the Company in the information circular to be prepared by the
Company in connection with the election of directors at a Shareholder Meeting.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Casual Vacancies

  

  

    

5.

  |  

In the event that an RS Nominated Director resigns, dies, becomes
incapacitated or otherwise ceases to be a director prior to the expiration of
his or her term as a director, such vacancy on the board of directors shall be
filled by the remaining directors with the nominee identified by RS promptly.
The Company shall use all commercially reasonable steps, promptly upon receipt
by it of a written notice from RS to fill such vacancy, as are necessary to
call (no later than five (5) days following notice of such identified nominee
by RS) a meeting of the board of directors to vote on the appointment of such
Shareholder Designee to fill such vacancy (or to obtain a vote of the
directors by way of unanimous written resolution) and take all such other
steps as are required by the Act with respect to such appointment.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Transitional Period

  

  

    

6.

  |  

This Part 28 shall remain in effect until the date that is the earlier of (i)
thirty-six (36) months following the effective date of the Merger and (ii)
when RS no longer has a right to nominate one or more directors under Section
1 of this Part 28.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Inconsistencies

  

  

    

7.

To the Company and the recipients of securities of Parent ("Recipients")
pursuant to the Merger:

  

  

    

1.

  |  

The Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger, including Parent
Common Stock issued in respect of Company Restricted Stock, ("Issued Shares")
have been validly authorized and issued as fully paid and non-assessable
common shares of Parent to the holders thereof.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

2.

  |  

The Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to the Merger ("Assumed

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

3.

  |  

The Parent Common Stock to be issued on the exercise of Assumed Options
("Option Shares") have been allotted and reserved for issuance to the holders
of the Assumed Options and, upon the due and proper exercise of the Assumed
Options in accordance with the terms thereof (including payment of the
exercise price therefor), the Option Shares will be validly issued as fully-
paid and non-assessable shares of Parent.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.

  |  

The issue of the Issued Shares and Assumed Options by Parent to the Recipients
in the manner contemplated in the Merger Agreement has been effected in such
manner as to be exempt from the prospectus requirements of Canadian Securities
Laws and no prospectus or other document is required to be filed, no
proceeding is required to be taken and no approval, permit, consent or
authorization is required to be obtained by Parent under Canadian Securities
Laws to permit the issue of the Issued Shares and Assumed Options to the
holders thereof; however, Parent is required to, within ten days after the
date the Issued Shares are issued file a report on Form 45-106F6 with the
British Columbia Securities Commission, and pay the prescribed fees,
accompanied by the fee checklist, if any, to the British Columbia Securities
Commission.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.

  |  

The issue of the Option Shares upon the due exercise of the Assumed Options in
accordance with their terms will be exempt from the prospectus requirements of
Canadian Securities Laws and no prospectus or other document will be required
to be filed, no proceeding is required to be taken and no approval, permit,
consent or authorization is required to be obtained by Parent under Canadian
Securities Laws to permit the issue of the Option Shares to the holders
thereof.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

6.

  |  

No prospectus or other document will be required to be filed, no proceeding is
required to be taken and no approval, permit, consent or authorization is
required to be obtained by Parent under Canadian Securities Laws in connection
with the first trade of Issued Shares or Option Shares in British Columbia by
the holders thereof through registrants duly registered under Canadian
Securities Laws who have complied with the relevant provisions of such
Canadian Securities Laws and the terms of such registrations, provided that:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Parent is and has been a "reporting issuer" in a jurisdiction of Canada for
the four months immediately preceding the trade;

   
---|---

no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or create a demand for the
Issued Shares or Option Shares that are the subject of the trade;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

no extraordinary commission or other consideration is paid to a person or

---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

    

(e)

  |  

if the selling security holder is an "insider" or "officer" of Parent as those
terms are defined under Canadian Securities Laws, the selling security holder
has no reasonable grounds to believe that Parent is in default of "securities
legislation", as defined in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions ("NI
14-101").
