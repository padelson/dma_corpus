extent transferable by Law;



(ix) any rights, claims, rebates, discounts and credits (including
all indemnities, warranties and similar rights), performance and other bonds,

Liabilities; and



(x) all other assets used primarily in the operation of the Property.



Section 1.2 _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or by virtue of Buyers acquisition of the
Partnership Interests prior to, or concurrently with, the Closing, the
Partnership shall assign to Sellers (or their designees) and Sellers (or their
designees) shall obtain all of the Partnerships right, title and interest in
and to, the following assets (the " _Excluded Assets_ "): 



(i) the Excluded Contracts;



(ii) any rights, claims and credits (including all indemnities,
warranties and similar rights) in favor of the Partnership or any of its

(iv) all Accounts Receivable of the Partnership;



(v) any refund or credit of Taxes of the Partnership constituting Excluded
Liabilities;



(vi) all human resources and other employee-related files and records, other

(vii) the Excluded Personal Property;



(viii) the Excluded Intellectual Property; and



(ix) any assets set forth on Section 1.2 of the Partnership Disclosure Letter.



Section 1.3 _Retention of Records_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Sellers may retain, at their expense, one
archival copy of all Assumed Contracts and other documents or materials
conveyed hereunder (including, without limitation, all customer data bases,
customer lists and all historical records of customers of which Sellers will
retain copies and the right to use in connection with its marketing and
loyalty programs, subject to the provisions of Section 8.17 hereof), in each
case, which (a) are used in connection with the Sellers or their
Affiliates businesses other than the Property or (b) Sellers in good faith
determine they are reasonably likely to need access to in connection with the
defense (or any counterclaim, cross-claim or similar claim in connection
therewith) of any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation against or
by the Partnership, Sellers or any of their Affiliates pending or threatened
as of the Closing Date.



Section 1.4 _Assignability and Consents_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to Section 8.15, if the assignment or attempted assignment to
Buyer of any Purchased Asset is (i) prohibited by any applicable Law or (ii)
would require any authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers from a third
Person and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have
been obtained prior to the Closing (each, a " _Non-Assignable Asset_ "), in
either case, the Closing shall proceed, but the Closing shall not constitute
the assignment of such Non-Assignable Asset, and this Agreement shall not
constitute an assignment of such Non-Assignable Asset unless and until such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained. After the Closing,
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers related to the Non-Assignable
Assets, and Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in any arrangement commercially
reasonable to Sellers to provide that Buyer shall receive the interest of
Sellers in the benefits under such Non-Assignable Asset until such time as
such third party consent, approval or waiver shall have been obtained, and
Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer in any such commercially reasonable
arrangement, and, in such case, Buyer shall be



 

3 liable to Sellers in a fashion equivalent to what Buyers Liabilities would be
under the Non-Assignable Asset if it were assigned. Sellers shall promptly
pay over to Buyer the net amount (after expenses and taxes) of all payments
received by it in respect of all Non-Assignable Assets. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 1.4 shall not apply to any authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers that are conditions to consummating the transactions under
this Agreement pursuant to Article IX below.



(b) Once authorization, approval or waiver of or consent for the sale,
conveyance, assignment or transfer of any such Non-Assignable Asset is
obtained, Sellers shall assign and deliver such Non-Assignable Asset to Buyer
at no additional cost to Buyer, and such Non-Assignable Asset shall thereafter
constitute a Purchased Asset. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall not assume any Liabilities under a
Non-Assignable Asset until it has been assigned to Buyer; _provided, however_
, that Buyer shall be liable to Sellers for performing its obligations under
the commercially reasonable arrangements described in Section 1.4(a).



(c) Except for delivery of the Assumed Contracts to Buyer by Sellers and as
set forth in Section 1.4(a) and (b), Buyer understands and agrees that it is
solely Buyers responsibility to obtain any and all operating agreements
necessary to conduct the Partnerships business from and after the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, replacement software license agreements
for the software which will replace the Excluded Software. Buyer shall also be
responsible for obtaining new licenses and permits for the operation of the
Hotel/Casino. Except as set forth in Section 1.1(viii), no licenses or permits
will be transferred by Sellers in connection with the sale of the Partnership
Interests.



Section 1.5 _Removal of Excluded Assets_. All items that constitute Excluded
Assets shall be removed on or prior to the Closing Date and within thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date by Sellers (or their designees), the owners of the
Excluded Assets, or their respective Representatives, with the removing
party making or causing to be made any repairs to the Property necessitated
by such removal, but without any obligation on the part of Sellers to replace
any item so removed. Sellers hereby reserve unto themselves and the owners of
the Excluded Assets, and their respective Representatives, a right of entry
into the Property and onto and across the Vessel at reasonable times and on
reasonable notice after the Closing Date and within such thirty (30) day
period to effect such removal, and, in that regard, Sellers shall use
reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Buyers operations. Sellers and
the Partnership recognize that Buyer will be replacing Excluded Software and
that Buyer desires that its replacement software will be operational as of
the Closing. Sellers and the Partnership agree to cooperate reasonably with
Buyer in effecting the transition from Excluded Software to replacement
software and to use reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to the
operations of the Hotel/Casino, including providing Buyer and its
Representatives access to the Property at reasonable times and on reasonable
notice _; provided that_ : (i) there shall be no material interference with
the Partnerships operation of the Property before the Closing; (ii) there
shall be no cost incurred by the Partnership or Sellers; and (iii) the
Partnership shall not be required to reveal proprietary information to Buyer.
The Partnership and Sellers will not de-install third party Excluded Software
that is now installed on personal computers at the Property and Buyer agrees
that Buyer will either obtain new licenses for such Excluded Software or cease
to use such Excluded Software following the Closing. If Sellers do not remove
all of the Excluded Assets within thirty (30) days following the Closing, upon
fifteen (15) calendar days notice, Buyer may dispose of any such remaining
Excluded Assets.

on the day immediately following the Closing Date. Each party shall bear its
own costs of participation in the preparation of the Operations Settlement.



(a) _Room Revenues_. Room Revenues for the night of the Closing Date shall be
divided equally between Buyer and Sellers pursuant to the
Operations Settlement. Revenues, other than Room Revenues, of the Property
for the night of the Closing Date shall belong solely to and be retained by

which would materially impair the use of the assets of the Partnership (other
than the Excluded Assets) as and where currently used. The Purchased Assets
include all assets that are necessary for the

as disclosed in Section 6.9 of the Partnership Disclosure Letter, the
Partnership owns or possesses adequate and enforceable rights to use the
Shreveport Intellectual Property as currently used without material
restrictions or material conditions on use, and, to the knowledge of the

in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect. To the Partnerships knowledge, no party to any Contract
related to the Shreveport Intellectual Property is (or upon Closing will be)
in breach or default, and to the Partnerships knowledge, no event has
occurred (or, upon Closing will occur) which with notice or lapse of time
would constitute a breach or default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration thereunder. The Partnership (i) has no knowledge that any

reexamination, cancellation, or opposition proceeding, or any currently
pending or threatened suit, action, or proceeding arising out of a right or
claimed right of any Person with respect to any Intellectual Property right,
(ii) has received no written communication that the Partnership is using or

by the Partnership under any of the Assumed Contracts, whether or not such
breach, violation or default has been waived, and (iii) no event has occurred
with respect to the Partnership, which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a material breach, violation or default of, or give rise to
a right of termination, modification, cancellation, foreclosure, imposition of
a Lien, prepayment or acceleration under, any of the Assumed Contracts, which
breach, violation, default, termination, modification, cancellation,
foreclosure, imposition of a Lien, prepayment or acceleration referred to in
clause (ii) or (iii), (A) alone materially interferes with the use, ownership
or operation of the Purchased Assets or (B) in the aggregate, with other such
breaches, violations, defaults, terminations, modifications, cancellations,
foreclosures, impositions of a Lien, prepayments or accelerations referred to
in clause (ii) or (iii), would be reasonably likely to have a Partnership
Material Adverse Effect.



Section 6.11  _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in Section 6.11 of the
Partnership Disclosure Letter, (a) there is no action, suit or proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation

time or both, would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension,
limitation or termination of any Partnership Permit that currently is in
effect, the loss of which either, individually or in the aggregate, would
be reasonably likely to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The
Partnership and, to the knowledge of the Partnership, each of its directors,
officers, key employees and Persons performing management functions similar to
officers and partners, are in compliance with the terms of the Partnership
Permits, except for such failures to comply which would not, individually or

likely to result in fines or penalties of $50,000 or more. To the
Partnerships knowledge, there are no facts, which if known to the regulators

employees or Persons performing management functions similar to an
officer, partner or limited partner under any Partnership Gaming Laws.

entitlement (but not for



 

26 accrual of pension benefits), service with the Partnership, the Management
Company and their Affiliates (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Partnership, the Management Company and their Affiliates provide past service
credit) shall be treated as service with Buyer.



(e) Effective immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Transferred
Employees to be covered by one or more medical benefit plans (" _Buyer s
Medical Plans_") which shall provide benefits to the Transferred Employees and
their dependents which in the aggregate are substantially similar to the
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of a Subsidiary of Buyer
Parent. Buyers Medical Plans shall not contain any "pre-existing conditions"
exclusions or limitations or "actively at work" requirements which would cause
any of the Transferred Employees or their dependents to be excluded from
Buyers Medical Plans immediately after the Closing. Buyer shall give effect,
in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such employees with
respect to similar plans maintained by the Partnership for their benefit
immediately prior to the Closing Date.



(f) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or designate a
defined contribution retirement plan which is qualified or eligible
for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Buyer s 401(k)
Plan_") and which is substantially similar to the Harrahs 401(k) Plan.
Subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement which is currently in effect or which may be in effect at any time
in the future, each Transferred Employee who satisfies the eligibility
requirements of Buyers 401(k) Plan shall become eligible to participate in
Buyers 401(k) Plan on the date he or she becomes an employee of Buyer and
shall be credited with eligibility service and vesting service for all periods
of service with the Partnership, the Management Company or any other entity if
so credited with such service under the Harrahs 401(k) Plan. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, the Partnership shall cause the trustees
of the Harrahs 401(k) Plan to transfer to the trustees or other funding agent
of the Buyers 401(k) Plan, the amounts representing the account balances of
the Transferred Employees (including the appropriate net investment return
thereon and any participant loans made to any Transferred Employees), said
amounts to be established as account balances or accrued benefits of the
Transferred Employees under Buyers 401(k) Plan. Each such transfer shall
comply with Section 414(l) of the Code and the requirements of ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.



(g) Except as otherwise provided in clause (f) above, Buyer shall not
assume any of the Partnership Benefit Plans, and any Liabilities arising from
the Management Companys employment of the Property Employees prior to the
Closing shall remain the sole obligation of the Management Company.



(h) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Transferred Employee, any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may
be provided to any Transferred Employee by Buyer or under any benefit plan
which Buyer may maintain.



(i) For a period of six (6) months after Closing (the " _No Solicitation
Period_ "), neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, solicit or hire for employment any Transferred Employee unless
(i) such Transferred Employee voluntarily resigns



 

27 from employment with Buyer or its successors or Affiliates after the Closing,
without any solicitation, promise or inducement from Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, (ii) such Transferred Employee initiates discussions regarding
such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by Sellers or any
of their Affiliates, or (iii) such Transferred Employees employment is
terminated by Buyer or its successors or Affiliates after the Closing. The
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that general solicitations for employees
through media advertisements, employment firms or otherwise shall not
constitute a solicitation for purposes hereof.



(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 8.5(a) below) or any other
agreement between the parties, the parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer
and its employees, including the Transferred Employees, shall be free to use
for any purpose the residuals resulting from the Transferred Employees access
to or work with any information of the Partnership and any information or
materials transferred by Sellers to Buyer in connection with this Agreement.
The term "residuals" means any information in non-tangible form that may be
retained solely in the unaided memory of Transferred Employees who have had
access to such information, including ideas, concepts, know-how, processes,
or techniques, and who have made no efforts to refresh their recollection in
anticipation of or in conjunction with the use of said residuals. Further, no
employee of Buyer party shall intentionally memorize the information so as to
reduce it to a non-tangible form for the purpose of creating a residual. No
party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such
Transferred Employees or to pay any form of compensation to Sellers for the
use of residuals.



Section 8.5 _Access to Information and the Property_.



(a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable Law, including without
limitation, antitrust Laws and the Partnership Gaming Laws, the Partnership
shall afford Buyers Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period from the date hereof to the Closing, to the Property
and to all its personnel, properties, Books and Records and, during such
period, the Partnership shall furnish promptly to Buyer (i) copies of monthly
financial reports and development reports, (ii) the audited
financial information relating to the Hotel/Casino for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003, and (iii) all other information concerning the
business and operation of the Hotel/Casino and the Property Employees (other
than the Reserved Employees), as Buyer may reasonably request. Buyer will
hold any such information furnished to it by the Partnership, which is
nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement dated
December 1, 2003, between Harrahs Operating Company, Inc. and Buyer Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding this Section 8.5(a) to
the contrary, Buyer and the Partnership agree that in the event any
proprietary information or knowledge relating to an Excluded Asset is
obtained, revealed or otherwise made known to Buyer in effecting (i) the
transition from Excluded Software to replacement software pursuant to Section
1.5, specifically, or (ii) the removal of the Excluded Assets, generally,
Buyer shall not reveal, disclose, employ or otherwise use any such
proprietary information, except as required by applicable Law. No information
or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall
affect or be deemed to modify or limit any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein.



 

28 (b) Following the Closing, upon reasonable notice, Buyer shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective Representatives, to)
provide Sellers and their Affiliates and Representatives with reasonable
access and duplicating rights, during normal business hours, to all of Buyers
personnel, properties, Contracts, Books and Records included in or related to
the Partnership (other than the Excluded Assets) and shall cooperate with
Sellers, as reasonably necessary for Sellers to pursue any suit, claim,
action, proceeding or investigation relating to the claims in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation related to
the Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be
required to provide any information which (i) it reasonably believes it may
not provide to Sellers and their Affiliates and Representatives by reason of
applicable Law or by a confidentiality agreement with a third party if, in the
case of a confidentiality agreement, Buyer has used reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such party to such disclosure, or (ii) constitutes
information protected by the attorney/client and/or attorney work product
privilege. If any material is withheld by Buyer pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer shall inform Sellers as to the general nature of the
material which is being withheld.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement between the parties, the
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) any obligations of confidentiality
contained in any such agreement do not apply, and have not applied from the
commencement of discussions between the parties, to the tax treatment and tax
structure of the transaction (and any related transactions or arrangements),
and (ii) each party (and each of its Representatives) may disclose to any and
all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to
such tax treatment and tax structure, all within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4.



Section 8.6 _Governmental Approvals_.



(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable best efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable, take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions governed by this Agreement,
(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
orders, waivers, variances, exemptions, approvals, licenses, authorizations or
orders required (A) to be obtained or made by Sellers, the Partnership or
Buyer or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
and (B) to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act
and antitrust and competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction), in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions governed herein, and (iii) make all
necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions with
respect to this Agreement, as required under (A) the HSR Act and antitrust and
competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, (B) the Buyer Gaming
Laws and the Partnership Gaming Laws and (C) any other applicable Law
(collectively, the " _Governmental Approvals_ "), and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all such Governmental Approvals. The parties hereto and
their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall file within thirty (30)
days after the date hereof, all required initial applications and documents in
connection with obtaining the Governmental Approvals (including without
limitation under applicable Buyer Gaming Laws,



 

29 the Partnership Gaming Laws and the HSR Act) and shall act diligently and
promptly to pursue the Governmental Approvals and shall cooperate with each
other in connection with the making of all filings referenced in the preceding
sentence, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing
party and its advisors prior to filing (provided, that each party may, as it
deems reasonably advisable and necessary, redact any competitively sensitive
information provided to any party under this Section 8.6(a) or any information
that is not pertinent to the subject matter of the filing or
submission, including personal information of individual applicants), and
consider and include in good faith all additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith. Buyer, Sellers and the Partnership shall
use reasonable best efforts to schedule and attend any hearings or meetings
with Governmental Entities to obtain the Governmental Approvals as promptly as
possible. Buyer and the Partnership shall have the right to review in advance
(for a period not to exceed three (3) Business Days) and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case, subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (including, without
limitation, antitrust Laws and the Partnership Gaming Laws), all the
information relating to Buyer, Sellers or the Partnership, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Affiliates or representatives which appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions governed by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Buyer, Sellers and the
Partnership will notify the other promptly of the receipt of comments or
requests from Governmental Entities relating to Governmental Approvals, and
will supply the other with copies of all correspondence between the notifying
party or any of its Representatives and Governmental Entities with respect to
Governmental Approvals.



(b) Without limiting Section 8.6(a), Buyer, Sellers and the
Partnership shall:



(i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date, including
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by
any Person; and



(ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate any
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Closing so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date), including implementing, contesting or
resisting any litigation before any court or quasi-judicial administrative
tribunal seeking to restrain or enjoin the Closing; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this Agreement shall require the Partnership, Buyer or any of
their Affiliates to commit to any divestitures, licenses or hold separate or
similar arrangements with respect to its, or their respective assets or
conduct of business arrangements, whether as a condition to obtaining any
approval from a Governmental Entity or any other Person or for any other
reason.



(c) Buyer and the Partnership shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval
is required for consummation of the transactions governed by this Agreement
which causes such party to reasonably believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such consent or approval from such Governmental Entity will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed. Buyer and the Partnership each shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to defend any
lawsuits or other legal



 

30 proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
governed by this Agreement, seeking to prevent the entry by any Governmental
Entity of any decree, injunction or other order challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, appealing
as promptly as possible any such decree, injunction or other order and having
any such decree, injunction or other order vacated or reversed.



(d) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each party shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge
of Buyer or the Partnership, as appropriate, threatened action, suit,

any other Person (i) challenging or seeking damages in connection with the
Closing or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Closing.

this Agreement shall alter or affect Parents or any of its Affiliates rights
under the Horseshoe Stock Purchase Agreement or require Parent or any of its
Affiliates to take any action under the Horseshoe Stock Purchase Agreement
(including without limitation obtaining any approval in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Horseshoe Stock Purchase Agreement), or
otherwise confer upon Buyer any right to require Parent or any of its
Affiliates to take any action pursuant to the Horseshoe Stock Purchase
Agreement or take any action under this Agreement relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Horseshoe Stock Purchase Agreement. 



Section 8.7 _Publicity_. The Partnership, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each
other the opportunity to review and make reasonable comments upon, any press
release or other public statement with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and except as may be required by applicable Law or any
listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Buyer, the Partnership and their respective Affiliates
may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by Buyer or Buyer Parent and the Partnership, or made by one party and
approved by the other, and do not reveal non-public information regarding the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 8.8 _Further Assurances and Actions_.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) using their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals,

necessary action (including executing and delivering further notices,
assumptions, releases and acquisitions) and Sellers shall bear the cost of any
such necessary action; _provided_ , that if such action is necessary due to
events or circumstances particular to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, Buyer

Affiliates shall assign to the Partnership all Intellectual Property held by
such entities that would otherwise constitute Transferred Intellectual
Property if such Intellectual Property rights were held by the Partnership as
of the date hereof.

other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Partnership relating to any Tax

of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax Periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give
the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Sellers or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to
take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Sellers further agree,
upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement). 



(c) _Tax Refunds_. The amount of any refunds of Taxes constituting an
Excluded Liability shall be for the account of Sellers. Any such amounts owing
to Sellers as provided in this Section 8.21(c) shall be paid by Buyer within

effective until the Closing Date. Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in making any such application provided that such cooperation shall not
result in any cost or expense to Sellers.

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION



Section 11.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_.



(a) Except as set forth in Article X and Section 11.1(b) of this Agreement,
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of each party

investigation made by or on behalf of any other party hereto, any Person
controlling any such party or any of their Representatives whether prior to or
after the execution of this Agreement.



(b) The representations and warranties made by each party hereto in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until (and claims based upon or arising
out of such representations and warranties may be asserted at any time before)
the first anniversary of the date hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
representations and warranties contained in Section 6.6 shall survive until
the expiration of the applicable period of limitations (giving effect to any
waivers or extensions thereof). The period of time a representation
or warranty survives the Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
the " _Survival Period_ " with respect to such representation. The



 

41 parties intend for the preceding two sentences to shorten the otherwise
applicable statute of limitations and agree that, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 11.1(b), no claim may be brought based upon, directly
or indirectly, any of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement after the Survival Period with respect to such representation
or warranty. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing, without any contractual limitation on the
period of survival (other than those covenants and agreements that are
expressly required to remain in full force and effect for a specified period
of time). The termination of the representations and warranties provided
herein shall not affect a party in respect of any claim made by such party in
reasonable detail in a writing received by indemnifying party prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period provided herein.



Section 11.2 _Indemnification_.



(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2(d) with respect to Taxes,
from and after the Closing, Sellers shall indemnify, save and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (each, a "
_Buyer Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all costs, losses, Liabilities,
obligations, damages, claims, demands and expenses (whether or not arising out
of third-party claims), including interest, penalties, costs of mitigation,
reasonable attorneys fees and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or
settlement of any of the foregoing (herein, " _Damages_ "), incurred in
connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to:



(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Partnership or
Sellers in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties made
in Section 6.6);



(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by the
Partnership or Sellers in this Agreement or any other agreement or
document contemplated hereby (other than covenants and agreements made in
Sections 4.1(a) and 8.21);



(iii) the Excluded Liabilities; and



(iv) the Excluded Assets.



(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2(d) with respect to Taxes,
from and after the Closing, Buyer and Buyer Parent shall indemnify, save and

incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to:



(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or
Buyer Parent in this Agreement;



(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by
Buyer or Buyer Parent in this Agreement or any other agreement or document
contemplated hereby (other than covenants and agreements made in Sections
4.1(a) and 8.21);



(iii) the Assumed Liabilities; and



 

42 (iv) the ownership, use or operation of the Partnership from and after the
Closing or the conduct of business of the Property from and after the
Closing.



(c)  _Interpretation_.



(i) The term Damages as used in this Section 11.2 is not limited to matters
asserted by third parties against an indemnified Person, but includes Damages
incurred or sustained by the indemnified Person in the absence of third party
claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the term
Damages shall not include any consequential, special or incidental damages,
claims for lost profits, or punitive or similar damages.



(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Buyer Indemnified Parties nor the Sellers Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to any recovery of Damages pursuant to this Article XI to the
extent that any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Sellers Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, had actual knowledge as of the Closing Date of any
Liability that gives rise to the Damages, including the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, that gives
rise to such Damages, but only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced or damaged by such failure to be informed of the existence of such
Liability promptly following such Indemnified Parties obtained knowledge of
such breach.



(iii) For purposes of this Article XI, Damages incurred or suffered by a party
arising out of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement shall be determined without deduction on account of any
materiality, Partnership Material Adverse Effect, Sellers Material Adverse
Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect qualification, as applicable,
contained in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise
to the claim for indemnification hereunder.

harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against (a) all Liability for
Taxes of the Partnership constituting an Excluded Liability, (b) any and all
Damages arising out of, resulting from or incident to any breach by Sellers
of any covenant contained in Sections 4.1(a) and 8.21 and (c) any and all
Damages arising out of, resulting from or incident to the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in Section 6.6, except to the
extent that any such Damages are otherwise indemnified pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

the Sellers Indemnified Parties from and against (a) all Liability for Taxes
of the Partnership constituting an Assumed Liability and (b) any and all
Damages arising out of, resulting from or incident to the breach by Buyer of
any covenant contained in Sections 4.1(a) and 8.21.



(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period:



 

43 (A) any Taxes levied on a per diem basis, other than Property Taxes (" _Per
Diem Taxes_ "), of the Partnership for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period; and



(B) the Taxes of the Partnership (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.



Section 11.3  _Procedure for Claims between Parties_. If a claim for Damages
is to be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Sellers Indemnified Party (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") entitled to indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written
notice briefly describing the claim and the total monetary damages sought
(each, a " _Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") as
soon as practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification
may be sought under this Article XI. Any failure to submit any such notice of
claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of
any Liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that an Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted the Notice
and the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed to pay the Damages
at issue, if the Indemnifying Party does not send a notice of disagreement to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the
Notice pursuant to Section 11.5.



Section 11.4 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.



(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.4(b) with respect to Tax
Claims, if any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against an Indemnified
Party by any third party (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which
indemnification under this Article XI may be sought, Notice thereof shall be
given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable. The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that an Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such
failure. After such Notice, if the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
to an Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party is liable and has
indemnity obligations for any Damages resulting from any such Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so elects at its
own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and
investigation of such Third Party Claim, (ii) to employ and engage attorneys
of its own choice (provided that such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party) to handle and defend the same, unless the named
parties to such action or proceeding include both one or more Indemnifying
Parties and an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party has been advised
in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to an applicable Indemnifying Party, in which event such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable cost, risk
and expense, to separate counsel (provided that such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and (iii) to compromise or settle such
claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the



 

44 written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
with the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom _;
provided, however,_ that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost,
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action
and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall cooperate with each other
in any notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume
the defense of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of
the Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted
will have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable
cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying
Parties _; provided, however,_ that such claim shall not be compromised or
settled without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement. The Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for any settlement of any
Third Party Claim effected pursuant to and in accordance with this Section
11.4 and for any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal), and the
Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party
from and against any Damages by reason of such settlement or judgment.



(b) If a claim shall be made by any Governmental Entity with respect
to Taxes, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant
to Section 11.2(d) (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly,
as practicable following the receipt of such Tax Claim, give written notice of
such claim to the Indemnifying Party; _provided, however_ , the failure of
the Indemnified Party to give timely notice shall only relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations hereunder to the
extent it is actually prejudiced by such failure. The parties further agree
as follows:



(i) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, Sellers shall, upon written notification to Buyer,
control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) at their own expense;
_provided, however_ , that with respect to Tax Claims the resolution of which
will be binding on the Partnership in a Post-Closing Tax Period, then Buyer
may also participate in such proceeding at its own expense and Sellers may
not settle such Tax Claim without the written consent of Buyer, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Sellers and Buyer shall jointly control all
proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the
Partnership for a Straddle Period. Buyer shall control at its own expense all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period beginning
after the Closing Date. A party shall promptly notify the other party if
it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim which it
is entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and the other party shall
thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding.



(ii) Sellers and Buyer and each of their respective Affiliates
shall reasonably cooperate with each other in contesting any Tax Claim. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and, upon the request of the party or
parties controlling proceedings relating to such Tax Claim, the provision to
such party or parties of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually



 

45 convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any
material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax
Claim.



Section 11.5  _Resolution of Conflicts and Claims_.



(a) If the Indemnifying Party objects in writing to any claim for
indemnification made by an Indemnified Party in any written Notice of a claim
(an " _Objection Notice_ "), Sellers and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims, and Sellers and Buyer shall provide information to the other party (as
reasonably requested) related to the issues set forth in the Objection Notice.
If Sellers and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties.



(b) If no such agreement is reached after good faith negotiation, either Buyer
or Sellers may demand mediation of the dispute, unless the amount of the
damage or loss is at issue in a pending action or proceeding involving a
Third Party Claim, in which event mediation shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to mediation. In any such
mediation, Buyer and Sellers agree to employ a mediator from the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") to assist them in reaching resolution
of such dispute according to the Commercial Mediation Rules of the AAA. The
mediator shall be a corporate attorney practicing in Las Vegas, Nevada, with
at least fifteen (15) years experience in acquisitions. The fees and expenses
of the mediator shall be shared equally by Buyer and Sellers. If, after
mediation efforts, Buyer and Sellers should agree as to all or a portion of a
claim, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both parties. If after reasonable efforts, and over a period of sixty (60)
calendar days, the parties are unable to reach agreement on such dispute
utilizing the mediator, the parties shall be permitted to proceed with any
other remedy available to such party.



Section 11.6 _Limitations on Indemnity_. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall
seek, or be entitled to, indemnification from any of the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to Section 11.2(a) to the extent the aggregate claims for Damages of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties are less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) (the " _Threshold_ ") or exceed an amount equal to Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , that, if the aggregate of
all claims for Damages equals or exceeds the Threshold, then Buyer shall be
entitled to recover for Damages subject to the limitations in this Section
11.6 only to the extent such Damages exceed the Threshold. In calculating the
amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Sellers
Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of the Damages (i) shall not be
duplicative of any other Damage for which an indemnification claim has been
made and (ii) shall be computed net of any amounts actually recovered by such
Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to such Damages (net
of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds). If
an Indemnifying Party pays an Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently
insurance proceeds in respect of such claim is collected by the Indemnified
Parties, then the Indemnified Party promptly shall remit the insurance
proceeds (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance
proceeds) to Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any applicable insurance
company any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for which the
Indemnified Parties seek indemnification under this Article XI.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are seeking, or are entitled to seek, indemnification from



 

46 any of the Indemnifying Parties for Damages due to (i) the Partnerships or
Sellers fraud or willful misconduct, or (ii) the Excluded Liabilities or
Excluded Assets, the Cap and the Threshold shall not be applicable to, or
otherwise limit a Buyer Indemnified Partys recovery for, such claim.



Section 11.7 _Payment of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash
by an Indemnifying Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party may become
entitled by reason of the provisions of this Article XI, within five (5) days
after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of the parties or
pursuant to the mediation proceeding described in Section 11.5 of this
Agreement or on the date on which both such amount and an Indemnified Partys

TITLE TO REAL PROPERTY



Section 12.1 _Title Commitment and UCC-11 Search_. Buyer agrees to accept the
Title Commitment attached hereto as _Exhibit L_ (the " _Title Commitment_ ")
and the UCC-11 Search attached hereto as _Exhibit M_ (the " _UCC Search_ ")
as evidence of the status of the Partnerships title to the Property as of the
dates set forth therein and for purposes of defining Permitted Encumbrances.
The Partnership shall deliver the Title Policy to the Buyer at the Closing,
and Buyer agrees to accept title to the Property subject to the Permitted
Encumbrances. Buyer shall pay the premium for the Title Policy. Sellers shall
execute any and all owners affidavits as reasonably required by the Title
Insurer as necessary to issue the Title Policy.



 

47 Section 12.2 _Defects_.



(a) The Partnership shall provide Buyer with an updated Title Commitment and
UCC Search not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing. If the
updated Title Commitment or UCC Search shows defects in title not shown by the
Title Commitment, UCC Search, the Partnership Disclosure Letter or exhibits
attached to this Agreement, or, if the Vessel and Fixtures thereon should
become subject to a Lien or other financial Encumbrance, and the Partnership
has received an itemized written notice of such defects within five (5)
Business Days after the date of delivery of the updated Title Commitment or
UCC Search to Buyer, the Partnership shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to cure any such defects in title, and the Closing Date
shall, if necessary, be extended accordingly. Title defects will not be deemed
to include any Permitted Encumbrances.



(b) Failure to notify the Partnership within the above specified periods of
title defects revealed by the updated Title Commitment, UCC Search, the
Partnership Disclosure Letter or other exhibits to this Agreement shall be
deemed a waiver of Buyers right to disapprove of the status of
the Partnerships title, and Buyer shall then accept such title as is
described in the Title Commitment and UCC Search, as updated, without
reserving any claim against the Partnership for title defects.



(c) Neither Sellers nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation
to remove title defects, and any failure or refusal of the Partnership to do
so shall not be a default of Sellers or the Partnership hereunder, except that
the Partnership shall be obligated to cure (i) monetary Liens or Encumbrances
(" _Monetary Encumbrances_ ") that are not disclosed by the Title Commitment,
UCC Search, the Partnership Disclosure Letter or other exhibits to this
Agreement (other than Taxes and assessments and the Encumbrances created or
suffered by Buyer pursuant to such Taxes or assessments) which encumber the
Property between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, in the manner
provided below and (ii) title defects created by the Partnership in favor of
the Partnership or its Affiliates. For purposes of the prior sentence, an
Encumbrance is "liquidated" only if it is fixed either by agreement of Sellers
or the Partnership and the party asserting the Encumbrance or by operation of
Law. In order to cure any title defects other than a Monetary Encumbrance,
the Partnership shall have the option to extend the Closing Date for a period
of thirty (30) days, by giving written notice of such extension election to
Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date. The Partnership may cure
Monetary Encumbrances by either of the following methods: (i) payment and
release of such Monetary Encumbrance of record or (ii) posting a bond which
causes such Monetary Encumbrance to cease to be a Lien on the Property.



Section 12.3 _Failure to Cure Title Defects_. If the Partnership fails to
cure Monetary Encumbrances or title defects created by the Partnership in
favor of the Partnership or its Affiliates that it is obligated to cure in
accordance with Section 12.2, such failure shall be a default by the
Partnership. If the Partnership elects not to attempt to cure or remove any
other title defects or is not successful in its efforts to do so on or before
the Closing Date, or the end of the extension period, if elected, then this
Agreement shall, at the option of Buyer (to be exercised by written notice to
Seller no later than the earlier of: (i) the original or extended Closing
Date, as applicable; or (ii) five (5) days after the Partnerships notice to
Buyer of the Partnerships election not to cure or attempt to cure such title
defects), be terminated and Buyer and the Partnership shall be released and
discharged from any further obligation to each other hereunder except as set
forth in Section 10.2(d) _; provided, that_ if Buyer so elects, Buyer may
accept such



 

48 title as is tendered by the Partnership without reduction in the Purchase
Price, or reservation of claim against the Partnership.



Section 12.4 _Survey_. Buyer agrees to accept the Property subject to all
matters shown by the survey described on _Exhibit N_ (the " _Survey_ "). The
Partnership shall, at the Partnerships sole cost and expense, cause the
Survey to be updated, recertified and provided to Buyer not later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing. If the recertified Survey reveals: (i)
any material encroachments of the Hotel/Casino onto property of others; (ii)
any material encroachments of property of others onto the Land; (iii) the
location of any title matter on the Land in a manner that would materially and
adversely affect the ability to use the Hotel/Casino as presently constructed
and located on the Land; or (iv) any other matter which would render
the Partnerships title to the Hotel/Casino and/or the Land uninsurable and
unmarketable, and if such matters were not revealed by the Survey, then such
disclosure shall be a title defect as to which the provisions of Sections 12.2
and 12.3 shall govern Buyers and the Partnerships rights and obligations.

provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service

drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
