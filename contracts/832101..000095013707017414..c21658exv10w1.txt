          Escrow Amount) via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
          account or accounts specified in writing by Seller to Buyer no later
          than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

          Agent"), as the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement, $12,500,000
          of the Estimated Purchase Price (the "Escrow Amount"), by wire
          transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts

          offer, preemptive right or other encumbrance, restriction or charge of
          any nature (collectively, "Encumbrances") securing such Indebtedness

                    (iv) pay to each Person to whom the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries owes a Company Transaction Expense the amount of such
          Company Transaction Expense as set forth in such Person's Invoice.

SECTION 1.6. ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE.

          (a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
for purposes of determining the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer Seller's good-faith estimates of Closing Cash ("Estimated Closing
Cash") and Closing Net Working Capital ("Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital"), such estimates to be (i) subject to the approval of Buyer, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) based
on the Company's books and records and other information then available and
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, policies, methodologies
and procedures set forth on Schedule 1.6(a) attached hereto (the "Specified
Accounting Principles"). Seller shall deliver to Buyer all reasonably requested
relevant backup materials, in detail reasonably requested by Buyer, together
with a certification, signed on behalf of Seller by its Chief Executive Officer
and confirming that such estimates have been prepared in good faith in
accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles, concurrently with the
delivery of such estimates. As provided in Section 1.3 hereof, the Estimated
Purchase Price shall be adjusted, dollar for dollar, up or down, as appropriate,
to the extent that the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital either (I) exceeds
the Base Net Working Capital (such excess the "Estimated Overage") or (II) is
less than the Base Net Working Capital (such shortfall, the "Estimated
Underage"), as applicable.

          (b) No later than thirty (30) days following the delivery of the
Audited Closing Financial Statements to Buyer as provided in Section 4.12
hereof, Buyer shall cause to be prepared in accordance with the Specified
Accounting Principles a statement (the "Closing Date Schedule") setting forth in
reasonable detail Buyer's calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Net Working
Capital, and shall deliver the Closing Date Schedule to Seller. Buyer shall
deliver to Seller all reasonably requested relevant backup materials, in detail
reasonably requested by Seller, together with a certification, signed on behalf
of Buyer by its Controller and confirming that such Closing Date Schedule has
been prepared in good faith in accordance with the Specified Accounting
Principles, concurrently with the delivery of such schedule.

          (c) If Seller disputes the calculation of any component of Closing
Cash or Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Date Schedule, then
Seller may deliver a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") to Buyer at any time
during the twenty (20) day period commencing upon receipt by Seller of the
Closing Date Schedule (the "Review Period"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the basis for any dispute as well as Seller's calculation
of the disputed component, which shall be done in good faith in accordance with
the Specified Accounting Principles. If Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice
prior to the


                                       11

<PAGE>

expiration of the Review Period, then Buyer's determination of Closing Cash and
Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Date Schedule shall be
deemed final and binding on Seller and Buyer for all purposes of this Agreement.

          (d) If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on each component of Closing Cash and
Closing Net Working Capital that is in dispute. If Seller and Buyer are unable
to reach agreement on the final resolution of each component of Closing Cash and
Closing Net Working Capital that is in dispute within thirty (30) days after the
end of the Review Period, then either party shall have the right to refer such
dispute to Ernst & Young LLP to resolve such dispute (the "Neutral Auditor"). In
connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the Neutral Auditor: (i)
each of Seller and Buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the
Neutral Auditor to provide their views as to any issues with respect to the
calculation of any of Closing Cash and Closing Net Working Capital that are
unresolved from the Dispute Notice; (ii) the Neutral Auditor shall determine
Closing Cash and Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with the Specified
Accounting Principles within thirty (30) days of such referral, and upon
reaching such determination shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the
"Expert Calculations") to Seller and Buyer; and (iii) Closing Cash and Closing
Net Working Capital, as determined by the Neutral Auditor shall, absent fraud or
manifest error, be binding upon the parties. In performing the Expert
Calculations, the Neutral Auditor (i) shall be limited to addressing any
particular disputes referred to in the Dispute Notice and (ii) such calculation
shall, with respect to any disputed item, be no greater than the higher amount
calculated by Seller or Buyer, and no less than the lower amount calculated by
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be. The Expert Calculations shall reflect in
detail the differences, if any, between Closing Cash and Closing Net Working
Capital reflected therein and Closing Cash and Closing Net Working Capital set
forth in the Closing Date Schedule. If such a review is conducted, then the
party (i.e., Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand) whose last
proposed offer for the settlement of the items in dispute, taken as a whole, was
farther away from the final determination by the Neutral Auditor pursuant to
this Section 1.6(d), shall pay all fees and expenses associated with such
review.

          (e) No later than three (3) Business Days following the final
determination of Closing Cash and Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to
Section 1.6(c) and (d):

                    (i) if the sum of Closing Cash and Closing Net Working
          Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and Section
          1.6(d), exceeds the sum of Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated
          Closing Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay the amount of such
          excess to Seller; and

                    (ii) if the sum of Closing Cash and Closing Net Working
          Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and Section
          1.6(d), is less than the sum of Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated
          Closing Net Working Capital, then the parties will cause an amount
          equal to such shortfall to be released to Buyer from the Escrow
          Amount, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.


                                       12

<PAGE>

All payments described in this Section 1.6(e) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts previously specified in
writing by the recipient party.

SECTION 1.7 TREATMENT OF ESCROW AMOUNT. Buyer, the Company, and Seller agree for
all tax purposes that: (i) the right of Seller to the Escrow Amount shall be
treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale
treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of
foreign, state or local law, as appropriate; (ii) if and to the extent any
amount of the Escrow Amount is actually distributed to Seller, interest may be
imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; (iii)
Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount, and all interest and
earnings earned from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or
any portion thereof, shall be allocable to Buyer pursuant to Section 468B(g) of
the Code; and (iv) in no event shall the total amount of the Escrow Amount and
any interest and earnings earned thereon paid to Seller under this Agreement
exceed an amount to be designated by Seller prior to the Closing. Clause (iv) of
the immediately preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the right of
Seller to the Escrow Amount and any interest and earnings earned thereon is not
treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price under
Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

              ARTICLE II - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

     Seller hereby makes to Buyer the representations and warranties contained

the failure to be so licensed or qualified has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the ability of the Company to own, operate, lease its properties and carry on
its business as currently conducted. The copies of the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Company Charter") and by-laws (the "Company By-laws"), each

nor is the Company committed to issue any such option, warrant, right or
security. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3, there are no Contracts to which
the Company is a party with respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock
of the Company or which restrict the transfer of any such shares. All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been issued and granted

all other applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) all requirements set forth in
applicable restricted stock purchase agreements and other applicable Contracts.
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3, the Company has not agreed and is not

Person.

<PAGE>

SECTION 2.4. SUBSIDIARIES.

          (a) The Company's Subsidiaries and investments in other Persons are
listed on Schedule 2.4(a). Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(a), the Company
owns directly or indirectly each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity interest of each of the Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.4(a), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns directly or
indirectly any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any Person
(other than investments in short-term investment securities).

          (b) Each of the Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability
company or similar foreign entity duly incorporated or organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its
business as currently conducted. Each such Subsidiary is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each other jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of such Subsidiary to own,
operate, lease its properties and carry on its business as currently conducted.
The copies of the organizational documents of each such Subsidiary, in each case
as amended to date and made available to Buyer or its Representatives, are
complete and correct, and no amendments thereto are pending. With respect to
each Subsidiary of the Company, Seller has made available to Buyer accurate and
complete copies of (i) the equity records of such Subsidiary, and (ii) the
minutes and other records of the meetings and other proceedings (including any
actions taken by written consent or otherwise without a meeting) of the
equityholders of such Subsidiary, the Board of Directors of such Subsidiary (or
equivalent governing body) and all committees thereof, in each case, to the
extent in the possession, custody or control of Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries. There has not been any material violation of any of the provisions
of such Subsidiary's organizational documents, and such Subsidiary has not taken
any action that is inconsistent in any material respect with any resolution
adopted by such Subsidiary's equityholders, the Board of Directors of such
Subsidiary (or equivalent governing body) or any committee thereof.

          (c) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized, issued and
outstanding capital stock of each of the Company's Subsidiaries is set forth on
Schedule 2.4(a). To the extent applicable, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or equivalent equity interests of each such Subsidiary
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other
rights of any kind to acquire any additional shares of capital stock or
equivalent equity interests of any such Subsidiary or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for, or which otherwise confer on the holder thereof any
right to acquire, any such additional shares or equivalent equity interests, nor
is any such Subsidiary committed to issue any such option, warrant, right or

after the date hereof and prior to the Closing (each, a "Material Contract") is
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries,
enforceable against them in accordance with its terms except, in each case, as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

     To Seller's knowledge, each Material Contract is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each party thereto other than the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms
except, in each case, as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

     Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of
Seller, any other party thereto, is in default or breach in any material respect
under the terms of any Material Contract. Since November 23, 2005, neither
Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice
or, to the knowledge of Seller, any other communication regarding any violation
or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract.

     To the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) result in a material violation or breach of any
of the provisions of any Material Contract, (ii) give any Person the right to
declare a default or exercise any remedy under any Material Contract, (iii) give
any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any Material
Contract, or (iv) give any Person the right to cancel, terminate or modify in
any material respect any Material Contract.

     No Person is renegotiating, or has a right (or, to the knowledge of Seller,
has asserted a right) pursuant to the terms of any Material Contract to
renegotiate, any amount paid or payable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Material Contract or any other material term or provision
of any Material Contract.

     Seller has made available or delivered to Buyer or its Representatives
accurate and complete copies of all written Material Contracts, including all
amendments thereto, and Schedule 2.13 provides an accurate description of the
material terms of each Material Contract that is not in written form.

SECTION 2.14. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

          (a) Schedule 2.14(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
patents, registered trademarks, registered copyrights, domain names and any
applications for any of the foregoing, in each case owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and related to the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as currently conducted (the "Company Registered Intellectual
Property"). Seller has made available to Buyer and its Representatives accurate
and complete copies of all applications, material correspondence with the United
States Patent & Trademark Office and any similar office of any country or
countries foreign to the


                                       27

<PAGE>

United States, and other material documents related to the application to
register all Company Registered Intellectual Property. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Company Owned Intellectual Property" means the Company Registered
Intellectual Property and all other Intellectual Property owned by the Company
or its Subsidiaries and used in or related to the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

          (b) Schedule 2.14(b) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
Intellectual Property licensed from third parties and used by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in, and material to, the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, other than commercially-available
software licensable on standard terms with a per copy license fee of less than
$10,000 in the aggregate (the "Company Licensed Intellectual Property," and
collectively with the Company Owned Intellectual Property, the "Company
Intellectual Property"). Except pursuant to the licenses listed in Schedule
2.14(b), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
compensate any Person for the use of any Company Intellectual Property that is
material to the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted.

          (c) To the knowledge of Seller, the Company Intellectual Property
constitutes all Intellectual Property used in and necessary for the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted,
including without limitation the design, manufacture, license, marketing,
support, importation and sale of all products and services of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

          (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries own exclusively all right, title
and interest in and to the Company Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear
of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). Since November 23,
2005, each person who is or was an employee, officer, director or contractor of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and who is or was involved in the creation or
development of any Company Owned Intellectual Property has signed an enforceable
agreement containing an assignment to the Company or its Subsidiaries of all
Intellectual Property in such individual's or entity's contribution to the
Company Owned Intellectual Property and waiving all non-assignable rights.

          (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
suit, action or proceeding which involves a claim of infringement, unauthorized
use, or violation of any Intellectual Property used or owned by any Person
against the Company or its Subsidiaries, or challenging the ownership, use,
validity or enforceability of any of the Company Intellectual Property. The
Company Owned Intellectual Property is not subject to any outstanding judgment,
decree, order, writ, award, injunction or determination of an arbitrator or
court or other Governmental Authority affecting the rights of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect thereto.

          (f) The operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(other than the business acquired pursuant to the Condor Agreements) as
currently conducted does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property owned by any Person. The operation of the business
acquired by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Condor Agreements
as currently conducted does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate (A) any
Intellectual Property owned by any Person, other than the rights of any Person
under any patent,


                                       28

<PAGE>

and (B) to the knowledge of Seller, the rights of any Person under any patent.
To the knowledge of Seller, there is no infringement by any Person of any of the
Company Owned Intellectual Property. No infringement, misappropriation, or
similar claim or proceeding is pending or threatened against the Company or its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Seller, against any Person who may be
entitled to be indemnified or reimbursed by the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to such claim or proceeding. Since November 23, 2005, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or other
communication relating to any actual, alleged, or suspected infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual Property of another Person by
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise related to the products or
services of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

          (g) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable
security measures to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets owned by the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, to the knowledge of
the Company, (i) there has been no misappropriation of any trade secrets or
other confidential Company Intellectual Property; (ii) no employee, independent
contractor or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries has misappropriated any
trade secrets of any other Person in the course of performance as an employee,
independent contractor or agent of the business; and (iii) no employee,
independent contractor or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries is in default
or breach of any term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement,
assignment of invention agreement or similar agreement or Contract relating in
any way to the protection, ownership, development, use or transfer of the
Company Intellectual Property.

          (h) To the knowledge of the Company, all Company Owned Intellectual
Property is valid, subsisting and enforceable. All patents, patent applications,
trademarks and copyrights included in the Company Registered Intellectual
Property issued by, or registered or the subject of an application filed with
the applicable Governmental Authority in the applicable jurisdiction (i) have
been duly maintained, including the timely submission of all necessary filings
and payment of fees in accordance with the legal and administrative requirements
of the applicable jurisdictions, (ii) have not lapsed, expired or been
abandoned, except for such issuances, registrations or applications that the
Company (or any Subsidiary) has permitted to expire or has cancelled or
abandoned in its reasonable business judgment, and (iii) are not the subject of
any opposition proceedings that have been commenced related thereto in any
jurisdictions in which such proceedings are available. Schedule 2.14(h) sets
forth any payments or filings with respect to the Company Registered
Intellectual Property that are required during the ninety (90) day period
following the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice alleging, and Seller otherwise has
no knowledge of the invalidity of, or any limitation on the Company's or one of
its Subsidiary's right to use, any of the Company Owned Intellectual Property.

          (i) Schedule 2.14(i) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
licenses, sublicenses and other written agreements to which the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries are a party granting any other Person the right to use the
Company Owned Intellectual Property, other than customer agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business.

          (j) No funding, facilities, or personnel of any Governmental Authority
or educational institution were used, directly or indirectly, to develop or
create, in whole or in part, any of the Company Owned Intellectual Property.

          (k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any
submission or suggestion to, or is subject to any agreement with, any standards
bodies or other entities that would obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant licenses to or otherwise impair its control of the Company
Owned Intellectual Property.

          (l) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11(l), neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is bound by, and no Company Owned Intellectual Property
is subject to, any Contract containing any covenant or other provision that
limits or restricts the ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to use,
exploit, assert, or enforce any Company Owned Intellectual Property anywhere in
the world, in any material respect.. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has transferred ownership of (whether a whole or partial interest),
or granted any exclusive right to use, any Company Owned Intellectual Property
to any Person.

          (m) Neither the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement
nor the consummation of any of the transactions or agreements contemplated by
this Agreement will, with or without notice or the lapse of time, or both,
result in, or give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare, (i)
a loss of, or lien on, any Company Owned Intellectual Property; (ii) a breach
of, termination of, or acceleration or modification of any right to use Company
Licensed Intellectual Property; (iii) the release, disclosure, or delivery of
any Company Owned Intellectual Property by or to any escrow agent or other
Person; or (iv) the grant, assignment, or transfer to any other Person of any
license or other right or interest under, to, or in any of the Company Owned
Intellectual Property.

          (n) No software incorporated in any product of the Company or its
Subsidiaries contains any "back door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan
horse," "virus," "worm," "spyware" or "adware" (as such terms are commonly
understood in the software industry) or any other code intentionally designed or
intended to have, or capable of performing or facilitating, any of the following
functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming, or otherwise impeding in any
manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer system

any data or file without the user's consent.

          (o) No source code for any software incorporated in any product of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any technical data or designs necessary to
manufacture the products of the Company or its Subsidiaries has been delivered,
licensed, or made available by the Company or its Subsidiaries to any escrow
agent or other Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any duty or obligation (whether present, contingent, or
otherwise) to deliver, license, or make available the source code for any
software of the Company or its Subsidiaries to any escrow agent or other Person
who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or could
reasonably


                                       30

<PAGE>

be expected to, result in the delivery, license, or disclosure of any source
code, technical data, design information or manufacturing information by the
Company or its Subsidiaries for any product of the Company or its Subsidiaries
to any other Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

          (p) No software incorporated into any product of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is subject to any "copyleft" or other obligation or condition
(including any obligation or condition under any "open source" license such as
the GNU Public License, Lesser GNU Public License, or Mozilla Public License)
(such software, "Open Source Software") that (i) could require, or could
condition the use or distribution of such Open Source Software or product on,
the disclosure, licensing, or distribution of any source code for any other
software combined, distributed or otherwise made commercially available with
such Open Source Software or (ii) could otherwise impose any limitation,
restriction, or condition on the Company or its Subsidiaries obligating the
Company or its Subsidiaries to distribute any product on a royalty free basis.

          (q) The Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained all approvals
necessary for exporting its products and related technology outside the United
States in accordance with all applicable United States export control

          (c) Whenever a representation or warranty made by Seller herein refers
to the "knowledge" of Seller, such knowledge shall be deemed to consist of the
actual knowledge of James Barbookles, John Kennedy, Joel "Gary" Wood, Joseph
Goustin and Karl Boone, and the knowledge that each of such individuals should
have obtained after reasonable inquiry in the course of the performance of their
respective duties on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have not conducted any patent searches, "right-to-use" or

information that is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
(ii) omit to state any material fact or necessary in order to make the
representations, warranties and information contained and to be contained herein

warranties and information were or will be made or provided) not false or
misleading.

good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Buyer is duly licensed or
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation under the laws of any other
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) Buyer has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument to be executed and
delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and to carry out
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by all requisite corporate action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, this Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its terms, except as such


                                       34

moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles.

SECTION 3.2. NO CONFLICT. Neither the execution and delivery by Buyer of this
Agreement and the other agreements, documents and instruments contemplated
hereby, nor the consummation by Buyer of the transactions in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof, conflicts with or results in a breach of any
provisions of Buyer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws. The execution and
delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the other agreements, documents and
instruments contemplated hereby, and the consummation by Buyer of the
transactions hereby and thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof,
will not violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of,
or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which Buyer is a party, or by which Buyer or any
of its properties is bound, except, in each case, as would not have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

SECTION 3.3. CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Buyer and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will not require Buyer
to make any filing with, or notification to or obtain any Consent from any
Person, except (a) where failure to obtain such Consent, or to make such filing
or notification, would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, (b) as may be necessary
as a result of any facts or circumstances relating solely to Seller, and (c) the
filing of a pre-acquisition notification and report form by Buyer under the HSR
Act, and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period

facilities of Buyer sufficient funds to purchase the Subject Shares and to make
payment of all amounts to be paid by it hereunder, in each case on the terms and
conditions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
Buyer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement is not in any way
contingent upon the availability of financing to Buyer.

SECTION 3.5. LITIGATION. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the actual
knowledge of the senior management of Buyer, threatened in writing, against
Buyer, and Buyer is not subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority that, in either case, would,
individually or in the aggregate, (a) delay, hinder or prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Buyer, or (b) have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.

SECTION 3.6. BROKERS. Buyer has not incurred or become liable for any broker's
commission or finder's fee relating to or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 3.7. INVESTMENT INTENT. Buyer is acquiring the Subject Shares solely for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as
such term is defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act. Buyer acknowledges
that the Subject Shares to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to


                                       35

the transactions contemplated hereby have not been registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction and
cannot be disposed of unless they are subsequently registered under the
Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable state or other
jurisdiction or an exemption from such registration is available.

SECTION 3.8. INSPECTION; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS.

          (a) Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged
expert advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of companies such as
the Company and its Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken
such investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents
and information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and
intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that (i) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to
(A) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to
Buyer or its representatives of future revenues, future results of operations
(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or
any component thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the future
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) any other
information or documents made available to Buyer or its representatives with
respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses,
assets, liabilities or operations, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Seller hereby acknowledges that nothing set forth in this Section 3.8
shall relieve Seller of any liability to Buyer arising out of any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation of Seller or any of its Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          requests received from any other Governmental Authority in connection
          with antitrust matters, and (B) not extend any waiting period under

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the sole and exclusive
          right to determine, at its option, whether to contest through
          litigation on the merits, negotiation or other action any position or

          antitrust matters which would operate to hinder or delay the Closing.
          Buyer shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct and control
          any such litigation, negotiation or other action, with counsel of its

          action that limits Buyer's freedom of action with respect to, or its
          ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or assets of the
          Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any such action may

          by this Agreement.

                    (v) In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable law
          and except as prohibited by any applicable representative of any
          applicable Governmental Authority, (A) promptly notify the other party
          of any written or oral communication to that party or its Affiliates
          from the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority, and, permit
          the other party to review in advance any proposed written or oral
          communication to any of the foregoing; (B) not agree to participate or
          permit its Affiliates to participate in any substantive meeting or
          discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
          investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement and the
          transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other
          party in advance and, to the


                                       40

          extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
          party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (C)
          furnish the other party, in advance of submission, with copies of all
          correspondence, filings, and written communications (and memoranda
          setting forth the substance thereof) between such party and its
          Affiliates and its Representatives on the one hand, and any government
          or regulatory authority or members or their respective staffs on the
          other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
          contemplated thereby, and permit the other party to review and comment
          on any such information prior to its submission.

          (c) Third Party Consents. Buyer shall use its good faith commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining the Consents of third parties
listed in Schedule 2.5(b), including providing to such third parties such
financial statements and other financial information as such third parties may
reasonably request. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller's

contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other party hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that (a) a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party hereto, issue or cause
publication of any such press release or public announcement to the extent that
such party reasonably determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
such action to be required by applicable Legal Requirements or by the rules of
any applicable self-regulatory organization, in which event such party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party hereto reasonable
time to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of its
issuance, and (b) a party may, without the prior consent of the other party
hereto, disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement to its Affiliates

evaluate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such agreement to
contain restrictions on the use and disclosure of such terms and conditions as
are substantively comparable in all material respects to the restrictions

provide Buyer with written notice of the occurrence, or failure to occur, after
the date hereof of any event (a "Matter") that, if it occurred, or failed to
occur, on or prior to the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth
or described on a Schedule in response to any representation or warranty
contained in Article II hereof and that would prevent Seller from satisfying the
condition set forth in Section 5.2(e) hereof (any such notice, an "Update"). The
Update will be deemed to update the Schedules for purposes of the conditions

          or any of its Subsidiaries, that, if pending on the date of this
          Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
          Article II, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions

reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Buyer no later than the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, an accurate and complete copy of: (a)
payoff letters, each dated no more than five (5) Business Days prior to the

ending on the Closing Date (the "Audited Closing Financial Statements"),
accompanied by an audit opinion of KPMG LLP. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Seller and KPMG LLP and shall cooperate fully and
promptly with Seller and KPMG LLP by providing information and providing
assistance as Seller or KPMG LLP may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Audited Closing Financial Statements. Seller shall permit
KPMG LLP to consult with the independent auditors of Buyer in the preparation of
the Audited Closing Financial Statements and to consider in good faith any
recommendations made by Buyer's independent auditors in respect thereto. The
Audited Closing Financial Statements shall fairly present, in conformity with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the consolidated results
of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the periods then ended (subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material in
magnitude) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act (and the related rules and regulations) and the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act (and the related rules and regulations). At such time as KPMG
LLP delivers the Audited Closing Financial Statements and its work papers with

SECTION 4.15. TAX MATTERS. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary:

          (a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Buyer agrees to cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to all Tax periods until
sixty (60) days following the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority.

          (b) Consolidated Returns. Buyer agrees that the Company will file a
consolidated federal income Tax Return with Buyer and that the Company will
become a member of Buyer's consolidated group at the end of the Closing Date in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii).

          (c) Responsibility for Preparing and Filing Tax Returns. Buyer and the
Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all
Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or
before the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date and for all
periods beginning on or before the Closing Date that end after the Closing Date.
Buyer and the Company shall prepare all such Tax Returns consistent with the
past practices of the Company. Not later than thirty (30) days before the filing
of any such Tax Return, Buyer and the Company shall provide Seller with a draft
of such Tax Return. Seller shall be entitled to review, comment on, and approve
such Tax Return before it is filed, and Buyer and the Company shall incorporate
all comments of Seller in such Tax Return. To the extent requested by Buyer,
such comments will be supported by a "more likely than not" opinion from Goodwin
Procter LLP (or such other law firm or accounting firm as mutually agreed to by
Buyer and Seller). Buyer shall cause the Company to deduct, and the Company
shall deduct, the 2007 Staff Bonuses on the Company's income Tax Returns for the
period ending on the Closing Date. To the extent that the 2007 Staff Bonuses are
not deducted on such income Tax Returns for the period ending on the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to deduct, and the Company shall deduct, the
2007 Staff Bonuses on the Company's income Tax Returns in the appropriate
period. The Company's past practices shall not preclude the deduction of the
2007 Staff Bonuses. Buyer shall not amend, or permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries to amend, any Tax Returns of the Company that relates, in whole or
in part, to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Seller. Buyer shall not make, or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
make, any election under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code to waive a carryback of a
net operating loss arising in any Pre-Closing Tax Period.


                                       45

<PAGE>

          (d) Refunds and Tax Benefits. Seller shall be entitled to any refunds
of any Taxes and amounts credited against Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period with respect to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, except to the extent
fully reflected on the Closing Date Schedule and used in calculating Closing Net
Working Capital. Buyer and the Company, upon the request of Seller, shall file
all applicable forms claiming such Tax refunds or credits and shall pay over to
Seller the amount of any such Tax refunds promptly upon receipt of any such
refund or entitlement to any such credit.

          (e) Certain Deductions. In the event Buyer, the Company, or its
Subsidiaries obtains a deduction for the 2007 Staff Bonuses in any Tax period
which ends following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to pay to Seller
the difference between (i) the Buyer's and the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
Tax liability for all periods other than the Pre-Closing Tax Period as computed
without taking the 2007 Staff Bonuses into account, minus (ii) the Buyer's and
the Company's and its Subsidiaries' actual Tax liability for all periods other
than the Pre-Closing Tax Period, within fifteen (15) days after the filing of
any Tax Return reflecting such reduced Tax liability.

          (f) Tax Proceedings.

                    (i) If, after the Closing, any party hereto becomes aware of
          any assessment, official inquiry, examination or proceeding that could
          result in an official determination with respect to Taxes due or
          payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
          Tax Period or any Straddle Period, such party shall promptly notify
          the other party hereto in writing. Such notice shall specify in
          reasonable detail the basis for such assessment, official inquiry,
          examination or proceeding, to the extent known, and shall include
          copies of any relevant correspondence received from the applicable Tax
          authority or any other Person relating to such Tax matter.

                    (ii) The contest and/or settlement of any issue raised in
          any official inquiry, examination or proceeding that could result in
          an official determination with respect to Taxes due or payable for any
          such Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period shall be conducted
          as follows:

                         (A) With respect to any tax proceeding involving a
               Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall have the right, at its own
               expense, to conduct the contest and/or settlement of such issue;
               provided, that Buyer shall have the right, at Buyer's expense, to
               participate with Seller in the proceedings and negotiations with
               respect to such issue. Notwithstanding such participation, Seller
               shall control the proceedings and, except as provided below, have
               the final say with respect to such negotiations and any
               disposition of such issue and, except as provided below, Buyer
               shall agree to any settlement, compromise or resolution of such
               issue proposed by Seller.

                         (B) With respect to any tax proceeding not described in
               Section 4.15(f)(ii)(A), Buyer shall have the right, at its
               expense, to


                                       46

<PAGE>

               conduct the contest and/or settlement of such issue and, except
               as provided below, have the final say with respect to the
               negotiations with respect to such issue and any disposition of
               such issue; provided, that if such issue involves the portion of
               a Straddle Period which is a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall
               have the right, at its expense, to participate with Buyer in such
               negotiations and Buyer and Seller shall jointly control the
               disposition of such issue.

                         (C) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.15(f) to
               the contrary, no party conducting the contest or settlement of
               any Tax issue shall have the right to settle, compromise, resolve
               or otherwise dispose of any such issue without the other party's
               written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be
               withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such settlement, compromise,
               resolution or other disposition reasonably could cause a material
               increase in the Tax liability of such other party or its
               Affiliates for any Tax period.

SECTION 4.16. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an estoppel certificate in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit I from the landlords under the Leases identified on
Schedule 4.16.

SECTION 4.17. BENEFIT PLAN MATTERS.

          (a) 401(k) Plan. Seller shall cause Nova Analytics Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Analytics"), to amend the Nova Analytics 401(k) Plan to
provide for full (100%) vesting of each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

          (b) Certain Insurance and Service Provider Contracts. Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer with respect to any Benefit Plan that is funded or provided
through an insurance contract or service agreement that insures or covers
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to obtain from such insurer or service provider contracts or
agreements that, from and after the Closing, separately insure or cover
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, on substantially similar terms as the contracts
or agreements existing immediately prior to the Closing.

          (c) Cooperation on Benefit Plans. The parties shall cooperate in
providing information for timely filing of all documents required to be filed by
any of the parties with the IRS or any other Governmental Authority with respect
to any of the Benefit Plans. The parties shall provide each other in a timely
fashion copies of plan documents (including prior or superseded plan documents),
amendments, trust agreements or other funding arrangements, material written
employee communications by the plan administrator or sponsor of each such plan,
all documents and reports filed with, and material correspondence with, any
Governmental Authority regarding each such plan's annual reports (e.g., the
complete Form 5500) including all attachments, actuarial valuation reports,
relevant employment data, employee plan benefit and expense information and
other data necessary for the continued proper administration of the Benefit
Plans.

SECTION 4.18. INSURANCE. At Buyer's cost and expense, Seller shall provide
reasonable cooperation to Buyer in order to afford Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyer and its
Subsidiaries are provided, to the maximum extent permissible under the
applicable insurance policies, the right to receive payment or have payment made
on behalf of Buyer, after the Closing, under any insurance policies of Seller
covering the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
and, to the extent such policies are prepaid, after the Closing with respect to
any claim or loss covered by such policies that arises out of, results from or
relates to any of the assets, liabilities or operations of such business,
including both known and unknown claims under such insurance policies, which
efforts shall include tendering claims under such insurance policies on Buyer's
behalf and remitting any payment in respect of such claims from insurers to
Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, any such rights of Buyer to receive payment
or have payment made on behalf of Buyer on any such insurance claim shall be
subject to any deductibles, self-insured retentions, retained amounts,
retentions or exclusions. To the extent permissible under the applicable
insurance policies, with respect to first party losses, Buyer shall be named as
loss payee as its interest may appear for any loss occurring prior to the
Closing.

SECTION 4.19. WTW/PINNACLE. As soon as practical following the Closing, but in
no event prior to January 2, 2008 or later than January 31, 2008, the Company
will sell, transfer, assign and delegate to Analytics (or a Subsidiary of
Analytics), and Seller shall cause Analytics (or such Subsidiary) to purchase,
acquire and assume from the Company on an "as is, where is" basis without
warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, or guarantee of
collectibility, (i) all inventories on hand at the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of WTW and Pinnacle products (as such terms are commonly used in
Analytic's business) and all accounts receivable attributable to the sale of
such products to third parties (collectively, the "WTW/Pinnacle Current
Assets"), and (ii) all accounts payable to third parties for such products (the
"WTW/Pinnacle Current Liabilities"). Following such sale, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days thereafter, (A) Seller shall cause Analytics (or its
Subsidiary) to pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company in immediately available
funds cash in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the net book value of
the WTW/Pinnacle Current Assets minus the WTW/Pinnacle Current Liabilities, and
(B) the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Analytics in immediately
available funds cash in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
WTW/Pinnacle Current Liabilities minus the net book value of the WTW/Pinnacle
Current Assets. From and after the Closing and prior to such sale, the Company
will not (and Buyer will not cause or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to)
take any action with the intention of deferring the payment of any WTW/Pinnacle
Current Liabilities or accelerating the receipt or collection of the receivables
comprising the WTW/Pinnacle Current Assets, in each case, outside the ordinary
course of business consistent with the Company's and its Subsidiaries' past
practice.

        ARTICLE VI - SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW;
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 6.1. SURVIVAL. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained
herein, as the case may be, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full
force and effect until the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing
Date, except for (i) the representations and warranties made by Seller in
Sections 2.9 (Taxes), 2.10 (Employee Benefit Plans) and 2.15 (Environmental
Matters), which shall expire 30 days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to any claim brought or that may be brought by any Buyer
Indemnified Party in connection with any of the matters to which Seller has
represented or warranted in Sections 2.9, 2.10 or 2.15, and (ii) the
representations and warranties made by Seller in Sections 2.1 (The Subject
Shares), 2.2 (Existence; Good Standing; Authority), and 2.3 (Capitalization),
and by Buyer in Section 3.1(b) (Existence; Good Standing; Authority), which
shall survive indefinitely; provided, that any written claim for breach thereof
made prior to the above-referenced expiration date, if any, for such
representation or warranty and delivered to the party against whom such
indemnification is sought shall survive thereafter and, as to any such claim,
such expiration, if any, will not affect the rights to indemnification under
this Article VI of the party making such claim.

SECTION 6.2. ESCROW AMOUNT.

The Escrow Amount shall be available, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, to compensate Buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations of
Seller and to make the payments required to be made to Buyer pursuant to Section
1.6(e)(ii), if any; provided, however, that any rights of indemnification or
other remedies specified herein shall be subject to Section 6.3(b).

SECTION 6.3. INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER.

          (a) From and after the Closing, Seller agrees, subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, to indemnify and hold harmless each
Buyer Indemnified Party, and shall compensate and reimburse each Buyer
Indemnified Party for, any Losses which are suffered or incurred by any of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any
third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are connected
with: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller contained in Article II; (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained in Article II as if such
representation and warranty had been made on and as of the Closing Date, except
for


                                       52

<PAGE>

such representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
time, which need only be accurate as of such time; (iii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement or that certain Side
Letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Seller, Analytics, ADS LLC
and Buyer; (iv) any Closing Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses, to the
extent not accounted for in the determination of the Estimated Purchase Price;
(v) any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the
Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (each such taxable period, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), except to
the extent fully accounted for in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital; and (vi) any of the matters set forth on Schedule 6.3(a).

     For purposes of clause (v) above, in the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, payroll, or sales
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period which relate to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed
to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in such Straddle Period.

          (b) The indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to Section
6.3(a) shall be limited as follows:

                    (i) Seller shall have no obligation to provide any
          indemnification until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that
          would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 6.3(a) exceeds
          $1,500,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), and then only to the extent such
          aggregate amount exceeds such Threshold Amount; provided, however,
          that the limitations set forth in this Section 6.3(b)(i) shall not
          apply to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to: (1) Section
          6.3(a)(i) and/or Section 6.3(a)(ii), in each case, to the extent such
          claim arises from or is a result of or directly connected with, any
          inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty set forth in
          Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.9, 2.10 or 2.15; (2) Section 6.3(a)(iii);
          (3) Section 6.3(a)(iv); (4) Section 6.3(a)(v); or (5) Section
          6.3(a)(vi).

                    (ii) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer
          Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.3(a) for any amount of
          indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Escrow Amount in the aggregate
          (the "Maximum Amount"); provided, however, that the limitations set
          forth in this Section 6.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to any claim for
          indemnification made pursuant to: (1) Section 6.3(a)(i) and/or Section
          6.3(a)(ii), in each case, to the extent such claim arises from or is a
          result of or directly connected with, any inaccuracy in or breach


                                       53

<PAGE>

          of a representation or warranty set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 or
          2.9; (2) Section 6.3(a)(iii); (3) Section 6.3(a)(iv); or (4) Section
          6.3(a)(v).

                    (iii) The maximum aggregate liability of Seller pursuant to
          this Article VI shall be equal to the Purchase Price.

          (c) Payments by Seller pursuant to Section 6.3(a) shall be further
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment actually received by the applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties
from any third party with respect thereto (net of any incremental premiums paid
or other costs incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Parties in obtaining such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment). The amount of
Losses otherwise recoverable under Section 6.3(a) shall be adjusted to the
extent to which any Tax liabilities or benefits are actually realized by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties by reason of any Loss (after considering the Tax
consequence of any associated indemnity payment) in any taxable year, calculated
on a with and without basis.

          (d) A Buyer Indemnified Party shall give Seller written notice of any
claim, assertion, event or Legal Proceeding (a "Buyer Claim") by or in respect
of a third party as to which such Buyer Indemnified Party may request
indemnification hereunder or as to which the Threshold Amount may be applied as
soon as is practicable and in any event within twenty (20) days of the time that
such Buyer Indemnified Party learns of such Buyer Claim; provided, however, that
the failure to so notify Seller shall not affect rights to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent that Seller is actually prejudiced by such
failure.

          (e) In the event of the assertion or commencement of any Buyer Claim
(whether against Buyer, the Company or against any other Person) with respect to
which Seller may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VI, the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the
defense of such Buyer Claim. If the Buyer Indemnified Party so proceeds with the
defense of such Buyer Claim:

                    (i) Seller shall make available to the Buyer Indemnified
          Party any documents and materials in its possession or control that
          may be necessary to the defense of such Buyer Claim; and

                    (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust or
          compromise such Buyer Claim if the relief consists of money damages
          without the consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
          withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that in the
          event Seller does not consent to the settlement, adjustment or
          compromise of such Buyer Claim proposed by the Buyer Indemnified Party
          in good faith taking into account the merits of the Buyer Claim, after
          consultation with Seller, Seller shall be deemed to have acknowledged
          that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
          under this Article VI in respect of such Buyer Claim and Seller shall
          as promptly as practicable post a bond, letter of credit or other
          similar security in each case reasonably satisfactory to, and in favor
          of, the Buyer


                                       54

<PAGE>

          Indemnified Party in an amount which equals the excess, if any, of (1)
          the money damages, if any, sought by the plaintiff or claimant in the
          matter over (2) the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount that is not
          otherwise subject to other pending Buyer Claims. Upon the posting of
          such bond, letter of credit or other similar security, Seller shall
          have the right to assume the defense of such Buyer Claim. For the
          avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right
          to settle, adjust or compromise any portion of a Buyer Claim without
          the consent of Seller that does not consist of a claim for money
          damages.

Notwithstanding an election by the Buyer Indemnified Party to proceed with the
defense of such Buyer Claim, Seller shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such Buyer Claim, in each case at
its sole cost and expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have the right to assume the defense
of any Buyer Claim that (i) does not involve any Governmental Authority or
customer of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii)
solely seeks as a remedy the payment of money damages in an amount less than the
remaining balance of the Escrow Amount that is not otherwise subject to other
pending Buyer Claims, and (iii) Seller first admits in writing is a Buyer Claim
for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under
this Article VI. If Seller shall undertake to defend such Buyer Claim, it shall
promptly notify the Buyer Indemnified Party of Seller's intention to do so. If
Seller so proceeds with the defense of such Buyer Claim, Buyer shall make
available to Seller any documents and materials in its possession or control
that may be necessary to the defense of such Buyer Claim. Notwithstanding an
election by Seller to assume the defense of such Buyer Claim, (i) the applicable
Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense of such Buyer Claim, and Seller shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (A) the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have received a written opinion from counsel that an
actual or potential conflict of interest makes representation by the same
counsel or the counsel selected by Seller inappropriate, (B) the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
Seller, that the Losses in respect of such Buyer Claim may exceed the remaining
balance of the Escrow Amount, or (C) Seller shall have authorized the Buyer
Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at Seller's expense, and (ii) the
Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Buyer
Claim at any time after Seller assumes the defense of such Buyer Claim if Seller
is not diligently defending such Buyer Claim. Subject to the penultimate
sentence of Section 6.3(e)(ii), if Seller does not elect to defend such Buyer
Claim within the thirty (30)-day period following its receipt of written notice
of such Buyer Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right, in
addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at Seller's
expense, to defend such Buyer Claim. The Buyer Indemnified Party's defense of,
or participation in the defense of, any such Buyer Claim shall not in any way
diminish or lessen the obligations of Seller under this Article VI.

In no event may Seller settle, adjust or compromise any Buyer Claim that Seller
is entitled to and has elected to defend without the consent of the Buyer
Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); provided, however, that Seller may settle, adjust or compromise any
such Buyer Claim without the consent of the Buyer Indemnified Party so long as
(i) the relief consists solely of money damages in an amount less than the
remaining


                                       55

<PAGE>

balance of the Escrow Amount that is not otherwise subject to other pending
Buyer Claims plus, in the event a bond, letter of credit or other similar
security has been posted in accordance with Section 6.3(e)(ii), the amount of
such bond, letter of credit or other similar security and (ii) the plaintiff or
claimant in the matter releases all Buyer Indemnified Parties from all liability
with respect thereto.

          (f) To avoid the duplication of recoveries, no Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any Loss arising from a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein (and the
amount of any Loss incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in
the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the
extent that such Loss is included in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.6.

          (g) The representations, warranties and covenants of Seller, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Buyer Indemnified Parties,
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any information
furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or any of their Representatives.

          (h) Any liability for indemnification under this Section 6.3 shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

SECTION 6.4. INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER.

          (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees, subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, to indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller Indemnified Party, and shall compensate and reimburse each Seller
Indemnified Party for, any Losses which are suffered or incurred by any of the
Seller Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Seller Indemnified Parties may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any
third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are connected
with: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in Article III; (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty of Buyer contained in Article III as if such representation and
warranty had been made on and as of the Closing Date, except for such
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
time, which need only be accurate as of such time; and (iii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

          (b) Except for claims for failure to pay the Purchase Price hereunder
and for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in Section 3.1, the indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to
Section 6.4(a)(i) and/or Section 6.4(a)(ii) shall not be effective until the
aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable
pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(i) and Section 6.4(a)(ii) exceeds the Threshold
Amount, and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Threshold
Amount. The maximum aggregate liability of Buyer pursuant to this Article VI
shall be equal to the Purchase Price.


                                       56

<PAGE>

          (c) Payments by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.4(a) shall be limited to
the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually recovered by the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties from any third
party with respect thereto (net of any incremental premiums paid or other costs
incurred by such Seller Indemnified Parties in obtaining such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or similar payment). The amount of Losses otherwise
recoverable under Section 6.4(a) shall be adjusted to the extent to which any
Tax liabilities or benefits are actually realized by the Seller Indemnified
Parties by reason of any Loss (after considering the Tax consequence of any
associated indemnity payment) or indemnity payment hereunder in any taxable
year, calculated on a with and without basis.

          (d) A Seller Indemnified Party shall give Buyer written notice of any
claim, assertion, event or Legal Proceeding (a "Seller Claim") by or in respect
of a third party as to which such Seller Indemnified Party may request
indemnification hereunder or as to which the Threshold Amount may be applied as
soon as is practicable and in any event within twenty (20) days of the time that
such Seller Indemnified Party learns of such Seller Claim; provided, however,
that the failure to so notify Buyer shall not affect rights to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent that Buyer is actually prejudiced by such
failure.

          (e) In the event of the assertion or commencement of any Seller Claim
(whether against Seller or against any other Person) with respect to which Buyer
may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any
Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VI, the Seller Indemnified
Party shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such
Seller Claim on its own. If the Seller Indemnified Party so proceeds with the
defense of such Seller Claim:

                    (i) Buyer shall make available to the Seller Indemnified
          Party any documents and materials in its possession or control that
          may be necessary to the defense of such Seller Claim; and

                    (ii) the Seller Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust
          or compromise such Seller Claim if the relief consists of money
          damages without the consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
          unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however,
          that in the event Buyer does not consent to the settlement, adjustment
          or compromise of such Seller Claim, Buyer shall be deemed to have
          acknowledged that the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
          indemnification under this Article VI in respect of such Seller Claim
          and Buyer shall as promptly as practicable post a bond, letter of
          credit or other similar security in each case reasonably satisfactory
          to, and in favor of, the Seller Indemnified Party in an amount which
          equals the money damages, if any, sought by the plaintiff or claimant
          in the matter. Upon the posting of such bond, letter of credit or
          other similar security, Buyer shall have the right to assume the
          defense of such Seller Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller
          Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise
          any portion of a Seller Claim without the consent of Buyer that does
          not consist of a claim for money damages.


                                       57

Notwithstanding an election by the Seller Indemnified Party to proceed with the
defense of such Seller Claim, Buyer shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such Seller Claim, in each case at
its sole cost and expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense
of any Seller Claim that (i) does not involve any Governmental Authority or
customer of Seller or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (ii) solely seeks
as a remedy the payment of money damages, and (iii) Buyer first admits in
writing is a Seller Claim for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification under this Article VI. If Buyer shall undertake to defend
such Seller Claim, it shall promptly notify the Seller Indemnified Party of
Buyer's intention to do so. If Buyer so proceeds with the defense of such Seller
Claim, Seller shall make available to Buyer any documents and materials in its
possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of such Seller Claim.
Notwithstanding an election by Buyer to assume the defense of such Seller Claim,
(i) the applicable Seller Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such Seller Claim, and
Buyer shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate
counsel if (A) the Seller Indemnified Party shall have received a written
opinion from counsel that an actual or potential conflict of interest makes
representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by Buyer
inappropriate or (B) Buyer shall have authorized the Seller Indemnified Party to
employ separate counsel at Buyer's expense, and (ii) the Seller Indemnified
Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Seller Claim at any
time after Buyer assumes the defense of such Seller Claim if Buyer is not
diligently defending such Seller Claim. Subject to the penultimate sentence of
Section 6.4(e)(ii), if Buyer does not elect to defend such Seller Claim within
the thirty (30)-day period following its receipt of written notice of such
Seller Claim, the Seller Indemnified Party shall have the right, in addition to
any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at Buyer's expense, to defend
such Seller Claim. The Seller Indemnified Party's defense of, or participation
in the defense of, any such Seller Claim shall not in any way diminish or lessen
the obligations of Buyer under this Article VI.

In no event may Buyer settle, adjust or compromise any Seller Claim that Buyer
is entitled to and has elected to defend without the consent of the Seller
Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); provided, however, that Buyer may settle, adjust or compromise any
such Seller Claim without the consent of the Seller Indemnified Party so long as
(i) the relief consists solely of money damages and (ii) the plaintiff or
claimant in the matter releases all Seller Indemnified Parties from all
liability with respect thereto.

          (f) The representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Seller Indemnified Parties,
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any information
furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties or any of their Representatives.

          (g) Any liability for indemnification under this Section 6.4 shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.


                                       58

SECTION 6.5. TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. All payments made by Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the other party pursuant to
this Article VI shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for tax
purposes.

SECTION 6.6. NO CONTRIBUTION. Seller shall not have, or be entitled to exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or other right or remedy against any Buyer Indemnified Party
(including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which Seller may become
subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

SECTION 6.7. REMEDIES EXCLUSIVE. From and after the Closing, absent fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, the rights of the parties to indemnification
under this Article VI shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties subsequent
to the Closing Date with respect to the recovery of any money damages any Buyer
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party may incur arising from or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood
that nothing in this Section 6.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
parties' rights to specific performance or other equitable remedies with respect
to the covenants referred to in this Agreement or to be performed after the
Closing). Subject to the preceding sentence, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, the parties hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect to the
recovery of money damages in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in
connection herewith, whether under any laws, at common law or otherwise.

SECTION 6.8. CALCULATION OF LOSSES. Solely for purposes of calculating Losses
under this Article VI once a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred
(and specifically not for purposes of determining whether such a breach has
occurred or for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 have been satisfied), no effect shall be given to
qualifications of materiality, such as "Material Adverse Effect," "in all
material respects" and other similar qualifications that are included in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement.

                            ARTICLE VII - TERMINATION

SECTION 7.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated:

          (a) at any time, by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

          (b) by Seller, if Seller is not then in material breach of any term of
this Agreement, upon written notice to Buyer, upon a material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement which
would be reasonably likely to result in the conditions set forth in either
Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b) not being satisfied, provided that such breach
is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after the giving of notice thereof by Seller to Buyer;

          (c) subject to Section 4.8, by Buyer, if Buyer is not then in material
breach of any term of this Agreement, upon written notice to Seller, upon a
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained
in this Agreement which would be


                                       59

<PAGE>

reasonably likely to result in the conditions set forth in either Section 5.2(a)
or Section 5.2(b) not being satisfied, provided that such breach is not capable
of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of
notice thereof by Buyer to Seller;

          (d) subject to Section 4.8, by Buyer, upon written notice to Seller,
if there has occurred a Material Adverse Effect;

          (e) by Buyer or Seller, upon written notice to the other party, if a
Governmental Authority or court of competent jurisdiction shall have issued any
order, injunction, judgment or other decree or taken any other action, in each
case, which has become final and non-appealable and which restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

          (f) by Buyer or Seller at any time after January 15, 2008 (the
"Outside Date"), upon written notice to the other party, if the Closing has not
occurred as of such date and the party seeking termination is not then in breach
of any of the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
date.

SECTION 7.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no further liability or obligations hereunder on the part of
any party hereto or their respective Affiliates except for the obligations of
the parties pursuant to this Section 7.2, Section 4.3 and Article VIII;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability
for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the time of such
termination.

SECTION 8.2. DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. Certain information set forth in the
Schedules referenced in Article II of this Agreement is included solely for
informational purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement. The disclosure of any information in such Schedules shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be
disclosed in connection with the representations and warranties made by Seller
in this Agreement or that such information is material, nor shall such
information be deemed to establish a standard of materiality, nor shall it be
deemed an admission of any liability of, or concession as to any defense
available to, Seller. The section number headings in such Schedules correspond
to the section numbers in this Agreement and any information disclosed in


                                       61

<PAGE>

any section of the Schedules of a party in referenced in Article II shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other section of the Schedules
of such party, but only if and to the extent that the relevance of such
disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be appropriate and reasonably apparent to a
person who has read that disclosure and such representations and warranties.

SECTION 8.3. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto, and any documents executed by the parties simultaneously
herewith or pursuant thereto, constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement
(excluding the provisions of this Agreement), which shall survive the execution
of this Agreement and any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.4. AMENDMENT; WAIVERS. This Agreement may not be amended or modified,
nor may compliance with any condition or covenant set forth herein be waived,
except by a writing duly and validly executed by Buyer and Seller, or in the
case of a waiver, the party waiving compliance. Waiver of any term or condition
of this Agreement by a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or waiver of the same term or condition by such party, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement by such party. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

SECTION 8.5. ASSIGNMENT. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent
of the other parties, except that Buyer may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i)
one or more of its Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Closing Date, to
any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Buyer of
its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
other party hereto or due to Buyer.

SECTION 8.6. NO AGREEMENT UNTIL EXECUTED. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not
constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding among the parties hereto unless and until this Agreement is
executed by the parties hereto.

SECTION 8.7. INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article or
Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms used
herein with initial capital letters have the meanings


                                       62

<PAGE>

ascribed to them herein, and all terms defined in this Agreement will have such
defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural
forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred
to herein, or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein, means
such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns.

SECTION 8.8. FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, shall bear its own
expenses in connection with the negotiation and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer and
Seller shall share equally any filing fees under the HSR Act incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 8.9. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the
laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of
laws.

SECTION 8.10. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each of Seller and
Buyer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United
States federal courts located in the State of Delaware (the "Chosen Courts") for
any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in
such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation
in the Chosen Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court that
such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each
of Seller and Buyer hereby agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise
subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain
an agent in the State of Delaware as such party's agent for acceptance of legal
process and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by
prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United
States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made
pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

SECTION 8.11. MUTUAL DRAFTING. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have
been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby
who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the
parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should


                                       63

<PAGE>

be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

SECTION 8.12. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement (a) shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns and is not intended to confer upon any other Person (except with respect
to Article VI) any rights or remedies hereunder and (b) may be executed in two
or more counterparts which together shall constitute a single agreement. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party
has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect, and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Time is of the
essence with respect to the performance of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.13. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and
to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.
