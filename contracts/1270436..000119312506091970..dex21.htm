WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a business combination through a merger
of Eagles with and into MergerCo (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland
General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "); 

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of Eagles (the " _Eagles Board_ ") has approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound,
the Company, MergerCo and Eagles hereby agree as follows:

the Effective Time, Eagles and MergerCo shall consummate the Merger, pursuant
to which (a) Eagles shall be merged with and into MergerCo and the separate
corporate existence of Eagles shall thereupon cease and (b) MergerCo shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall remain a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. From and after the

obligations of Eagles. The Merger shall have the effects specified in
the relevant sections of Maryland law.

1.2 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

(a) The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Alesco Acquisition Inc."

(b) The articles of incorporation of MergerCo shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.

 

(c) The bylaws of MergerCo shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended.

(d) As of the Effective Time, the name of the Company shall be changed to
"Alesco Financial Inc."

1.3 _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, prior to
the Closing (as defined in Section 1.2), the Company, MergerCo and Eagles
shall prepare, and on the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be filed
with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, articles of merger
(the " _Articles of_  



 

1   _Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed by the Surviving
Corporation (as defined in Section 1.3) in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the MGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under Maryland law. The Merger shall become effective at (a) such time as the
Articles of Merger has been duly filed with the Maryland Department
of Assessments and Taxation or (b) such other time as is agreed upon by the
Company and Eagles and specified in the Articles of Merger. Such time is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time._ "

1.4 _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second Business Day)
after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than conditions
that by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but
subject to such conditions) shall have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of
the same (unless extended by the mutual agreement of the parties hereto),
provided that the Closing shall not be earlier than August 31, 2006, and,
subject to the foregoing, shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on such
date (the " _Closing Date_ ") at the offices of Clifford Chance US LLP, 31
West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, or at such other time or place as
mutually agreed to by the parties hereto.

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation; Increase in Size of
the Company Board._

(a) The persons named on Exhibit 1 hereto shall be the initial directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The Company Board shall be reconstituted as of the Effective Time to
consist of nine directors, three of whom shall be the independent directors
(as defined by the NYSE) of the Company listed on Exhibit 2, three of whom
shall be the independent directors (as defined by the NYSE) of Eagles listed
on Exhibit 2, one of whom shall be an independent director (as defined by the
NYSE) designated by Eagles and two of whom shall be Daniel G. Cohen and James
J. McEntee.

1.6 _Provisions Relating to Record Dates for Final Dividends._ Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and to the extent necessary for
Eagles to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 857(a)(1) for the taxable
year of Eagles ending at the Effective Time and, if applicable, the preceding
taxable year (and to allow Eagles to distribute 100% of its "real estate
investment trust taxable income" (as such term is used in Code Section 857(a)
and taking into account any dividends previously paid during the tax year that
would be expected to give rise to a dividends-paid deduction for such tax
year, but before reduction for the dividend contemplated by this Section 1.6)
in order to avoid the payment of any tax with respect to undistributed income
or gain), Eagles shall declare a dividend (the " _Final Eagles Dividend_ ") to
holders of Eagles Common Shares (as defined below), the record date for which
shall precede the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the minimum dividend
sufficient to permit Eagles to satisfy such requirements. Any dividends
payable hereunder to holders of Eagles Common Shares shall be paid prior to
the Closing Date.

1.7 _Further Assurances._ If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable
or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record of otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of Eagles or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Eagles,
all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name
and on behalf of Eagles, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable
or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its rights, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets
of Eagles and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

1.8 _Headquarters._

As of the Effective Time, the headquarters of the Company shall be moved to
the current location of Eagles headquarters.



 

2 ARTICLE II

_Merger Consideration; Conversion of Stock_

2.1 _Conversion of Eagles Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof:

(a) _Capital Stock of MergerCo._ Each share of common stock of MergerCo, par
value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall represent one (1) share of
the validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share.

(b) _Cancellation of Company-Owned and MergerCo-Owned Eagles Common Stock._
Each issued and outstanding common share of beneficial interest of Eagles, par
value $.001 per share (the " _Eagles Common Shares_ "), that is owned by the
Company, MergerCo or any Subsidiary of the Company or MergerCo immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash,
stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Exchange Ratio for Eagles Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each
Eagles Common Share (other than Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive 1.26 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Shares_ ").

(d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. In addition to the adjustments to the
Exchange Ratio contemplated by Section 2.1(i), the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, combination,
subdivision, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Eagles Common Shares
or Company Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Eagles Common Shares or Company Common
Shares occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Cancellation and Retirement of Eagles Common Shares._ As of the
Effective Time, all Eagles Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Eagles Common
Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares, except, in all cases, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2. The right of any holder of any Eagles Common Share to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of
any withholding that is required under applicable tax law.

(f) _Cancellation of Company Stock Options and Warrants._ The Company
shall ensure that, at the Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or
nonqualified option to purchase Company Common Shares (" _Company Stock
Options_ ") under any employee stock option or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company (" _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") and all
outstanding warrants to purchase Company Common Shares (the " _Warrants_ "),
whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the
exercise price thereof, shall be cancelled, effective as of the Effective
Time, in exchange for the right to receive at the Effective Time a single lump
sum distribution, equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Common
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option or Warrant, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable,
and (ii) the excess, if any, of $8.74 (the " _Adjusted Book Value_ ") over the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option or Warrant
(collectively, the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ") _; provided_ that if the
exercise price per share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the Adjusted Book Value, such Company Stock Option or Warrant
shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. All
payments under this paragraph shall be subject to any applicable withholding
tax. A complete list of all Company Stock Option Plans and Warrant agreements
is set forth in Section 2.1(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(g) _Vesting of Restricted Stock_. Eagles acknowledges that all restricted
stock awards granted under the Company Stock Option Plans (the " _Company
Restricted Stock Awards_ ") shall vest in full immediately prior to the  



 

3  Effective Time so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting
requirements and all such Company Common Shares shall be considered
outstanding shares for all purposes from and after the Effective Time. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of restricted stock awards
granted by Eagles (the " _Eagles Restricted Stock Awards_ ") may not
accelerate at the Effective Time and the restrictions applicable to such
awards (including without limitation, vesting) may continue in accordance with
the terms of such grants.

(h) _Repurchase of Company Common Shares_. On the date the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
" _SEC_ "), the Company shall commence a tender offer (the " _Repurchase
Offer_ ") to purchase such number of Company Common Shares as shall be equal
to the quotient derived by dividing $25 million (the " _Repurchase Amount_ ")
by the Adjusted Book Value, at a per share price in cash equal to the
Adjusted Book Value. The Repurchase Offer shall have an initial expiration
date twenty business days following the commencement of the Repurchase Offer
and shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit 3. The Company
shall accept shares for payment in the Repurchase Offer no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

On the date of commencement of the Repurchase Offer, the Company shall file
with the SEC with respect to the Offer a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") which will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and will contain the offer to purchase relating to the Offer and
form of the related letter of transmittal (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto and including the exhibits thereto, are
referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company
shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company
Common Shares as and to the extent required by the U.S. federal securities
laws. The Offer Documents and any amendments and supplements thereto shall be
subject to Eagles consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall
provide Eagles and its counsel any comments that the Company or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of any such comments. Each party shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so
corrected to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case,
as and to the extent required by applicable U. S. federal securities laws.
The Company shall cause the Repurchase Offer to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall recommend either
that shareholders accept or not accept the Repurchase Offer.

(i) _Adjustments_. The Exchange Ratio, the Repurchase Amount and the Adjusted
Book Value shall be subject to adjustment as follows (1) if the principal
balance of the Peerless loan exceeds $8 million at July 31, 2006, the Adjusted
Book Value shall be reduced (on a per share basis) by 60% of the difference
between $8 million and the principal balance of the loan on such date,
the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly increased and the Repurchase
Amount shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the amount of such
reduction in the Adjusted Book Value and (2) if there remains any principal
balance in East-West Commerce Center loan on July 31, 2006, the Adjusted Book
Value shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the principal balance
of the East-West Commerce Center loan on such date, the Exchange Ratio shall
be correspondingly increased and the Repurchase Amount shall be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis in the amount of such reduction in the Adjusted Book
Value. The Company shall not forgive any amounts due on such loans. Attached
hereto as Exhibit 4 is a sample calculation, for illustrative purposes only,
of the adjustments described in this Section 2.1(i).

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to mailing the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Eagles to act as
Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the Merger Consideration. By
10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
the Exchange Agent certificates representing the Company Common
Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration and the
amount of cash sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
(the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or
exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Company  



 

4  Common Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed
with respect to such the Company Common Shares for the account of the Persons
entitled thereto.

(b) _Stock Transfer Books._ At the Effective Time, the common share transfer
books of Eagles shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Eagles Common Shares on the records of Eagles.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
ownership of Eagles Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Eagles Common
Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Company for any reason shall be converted into the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the Eagles Common Shares formerly represented
thereby.

(c) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as possible after the Effective Time (but
in any event within three Business Days), the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Eagles Common Shares whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the
Exchange Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the
Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration to
which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably
satisfactory to Eagles as may be appointed by the Company, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
Eagles Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Eagles
Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Eagles,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Company that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Eagles Common Shares, Company Stock
Options or Warrants Exchanged For Merger Consideration._ The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
representing Eagles Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Eagles Common Shares exchanged for Merger
Consideration theretofore represented by such Certificates.

(e) _No Liability._ None of the Company, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation,
Eagles or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _No Fractional Shares._ No certificate or scrip representing fractional
Eagles Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Company.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of a
Company Common Share exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Company Common Share (after
taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (rounding up to the nearest whole cent and without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of one Company Common
Share multiplied by the closing price of the Company Common Shares on the NYSE
on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 



 

5 (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting of a
bond to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company and the Exchange Agent, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to
this Agreement.

(h)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to the Eagles Common Shares, dividends on
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable prior
to or on the date of such constituting all or a portion of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
representing Eagles Common Shares until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the certificates representing the Eagles Common Shares, (i) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time payable prior to or on the date of such
surrender with respect to such whole Eagles Common Shares, and not paid, less
the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the
date of surrender and a payment date subsequent to the date of surrender
payable with respect to such whole Eagles Common Shares, less the amount of
any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.

(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, and any
holders of Eagles Common Shares prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Company and
only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(j) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Company. To the extent that there are losses with respect
to such investments, the Company shall promptly replace or restore the portion
of the Exchange Fund lost through investments.

2.3 _Withholding Rights._ The Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Eagles Common
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Eagles Common Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties of Eagles_

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered at or prior to the
execution hereof to the Company and MergerCo which disclosure schedule
identifies exceptions only by the specific Section or subsection to which each
entry relates or to any other Section or subsection to which the applicability
of the exception is readily apparent on its face (the " _Eagles Disclosure
Schedule_ "), Eagles represents and warrants to the Company and MergerCo as
follows:

3.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Compliance with Law._

(a) Eagles is a real estate investment trust duly formed, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland. Except as set forth
in Section 3.1(a) of the Eagles Disclosure Schedule, Eagles is duly qualified
or licensed to do business as a foreign trust and is in good standing under
the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Eagles Material  



 

6  Adverse Effect. Eagles has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate, lease and encumber its assets and carry on its business as
now conducted.

(b) Each of the Subsidiaries of Eagles listed in Section 3.1(b) of the Eagles
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Eagles Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation, limited
partnership, limited liability company or trust, duly incorporated or
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Except as set forth in Section
3.1(b) of the Eagles Disclosure Schedule, each Eagles Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except for
jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified, licensed or to be in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have an Eagles Material Adverse Effect. Each Eagles Subsidiary
has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, operate,
lease and encumber its assets and carry on its business as now conducted.
Eagles has no other Subsidiaries other than the Eagles Subsidiaries. Neither
Eagles nor any Eagles Subsidiary has any predecessors other than as set forth
on Section 3.1(b) of the Eagles Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Eagles Disclosure Schedule,
neither Eagles nor any of the Eagles Subsidiaries is in violation of any order
of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any
law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which Eagles or any Eagles
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets is subject, where
such violation, alone or together with all other violations, would reasonably
be expected to have an Eagles Material Adverse Effect. Eagles and the Eagles
Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses, permits and other authorizations and
have taken all actions required by applicable law or governmental regulations
in connection with their businesses as now conducted, except where the
failure to obtain any such license, permit or authorization or to take any
such action, alone or together with all other such failures, would not
reasonably be expected to have an Eagles Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Eagles has previously provided or made available to the Company true and
complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws and the other
charter documents, bylaws, organizational documents and partnership, limited
liability company, trust agreements and joint venture agreements (and in each
such case, all amendments thereto) of Eagles and each of the Eagles
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

3.2 _Authorization, Takeover Laws, Validity and Effect of Agreements._ Eagles
has all requisite trust power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and perform
its obligations hereunder. Subject only to the approval of this Agreement by
the requisite holders of Eagles Common Shares, the execution, delivery and
performance by Eagles of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on behalf of Eagles. In connection with the foregoing, the
Eagles Board has taken such actions and votes as are necessary on its part to
render the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or any other anti-takeover statute or similar federal or
state statute inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company and MergerCo,
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Eagles, enforceable
against Eagles in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general principles of equity.

3.3 _Capitalization._

(a) The authorized capital stock of Eagles consists of 100,000,000 Eagles

neither Eagles nor any Eagles Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent
or otherwise, by reason of any agreement to register the offer and sale or
resale of any of their securities under the Securities Act.

3.4 _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.1(b) of the Eagles Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the name, jurisdictions of incorporation or organization of each Eagles
Subsidiary. All issued and outstanding shares or other equity interests of

Eagles Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any interest or investment
(whether equity or debt) in any Person (other than investments in short-term
investment securities). Except as set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the
Eagles Disclosure Schedule, no Affiliate of Eagles (other than Eagles
Subsidiaries) owns any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any

other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, state
securities or state "blue sky" laws, any antitrust laws  



 

8  and (b) for filing of the Articles of Merger, none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by Eagles, the consummation by
Eagles of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by Eagles with
any of the provisions hereof will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of
any provision of the organizational documents of Eagles or any Eagles
Subsidiary, (ii) require any filing by Eagles with, notice to, or permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any state or federal government or
governmental authority or by any United States or state court of competent
jurisdiction (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), (iii) result in a violation or
breach by Eagles of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,

conditions or provisions of any Material Contract to which Eagles or any
Eagles Subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of its respective
properties or assets may be bound, or (iv) violate any order,
writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Eagles or
any Eagles Subsidiary or any of its respective properties or assets
(collectively, " _Laws_ "), excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv) such filings, notices, permits, authorizations, consents, approvals,
violations, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, (A) prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, (B)
otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by Eagles of its material
obligations under this Agreement or (C) reasonably be expected to have an
Eagles Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 _No Restraints._ Neither Eagles nor any Eagles Subsidiary is or will be
subject to any outstanding judgment, order, restraining order,

conduct of its business or that relates to policies, affairs, managements or

have an Eagles Material Adverse Effect.

3.8 _Financial Statements_. The Eagles consolidated balance sheet dated
January 1, 2006 (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Eagles and
the Eagles Subsidiaries as of its date, in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

There are no liabilities of Eagles or any of its subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, known or unknown, whether or not accrued and whether or not
contingent or absolute, other than (i) liabilities disclosed in Eagles
consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 and (ii) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business since such date, none of which are
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Eagles.

3.9 _Litigation._ Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Eagles Disclosure
Schedule, (a) there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of Eagles, threatened against Eagles or any of
the Eagles Subsidiaries and (b) neither Eagles nor any Eagles Subsidiary is
subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction or decree of
any Governmental Entity or the person which, in the case of (a) or (b),
would, individually or in the aggregate, (i) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger, (ii) otherwise prevent or materially delay
performance by Eagles of any of its obligations under this Agreement or (iii)
reasonably be expected to have an Eagles Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.9

proceeding or investigation that is pending or, to the knowledge of Eagles,
threatened against the Eagles or any of the Eagles Subsidiaries and any
outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Entity or other person against Eagles or any Eagles Subsidiary.

Eagles and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Eagles Permits_ "), except for
failures to hold such Eagles Permits that would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Eagles. Eagles and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Eagles Permits, except where the failure so to comply would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Eagles. The businesses of Eagles and its
subsidiaries have not been and are not being conducted in violation of any
law except for violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Eagles. No investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with respect
to Eagles or any of its subsidiaries is pending or, to the best knowledge of
Eagles, threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention
to conduct any such investigation or review, other than, in each case, where
the outcome would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Eagles.



 

9 3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes._ Except as disclosed in Section 3.10 of the
Eagles Disclosure Schedule, from January 1, 2006 through the date hereof,
there has not been an Eagles Material Adverse Effect and Eagles and Eagles
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course of
business and there has not been any action contemplated by Section 5.1.

3.11 _Taxes._ Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.11 of the Eagles
Disclosure Schedule:

(a) For the taxable year commencing with their respective dates of formation
(the " _Eagles Initial Tax Year_ "), and each taxable year thereafter, each
of Eagles and the Eagles Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed all Tax Returns and
reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing
extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity have authority to do so),
and all such Tax Returns and reports are true, accurate and complete in all
material respects, and (ii) has paid (or Eagles has paid on its behalf) within
the time and manner prescribed by law, all Taxes. Eagles most recent
financial statements reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by Eagles and each Eagles Subsidiary for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Each of Eagles
and the Eagles Subsidiaries has established (and through the Closing Date
will continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves in
accordance with GAAP that are adequate for the payment of all material
liabilities for Taxes accruing through the period covered by such books and
records. True, correct and complete copies of all federal, state and local Tax
Returns for Eagles and each Eagles Subsidiary and all written communications
with any taxing authority relating to such Tax Returns requested by the
Company or its representatives have been delivered or made available to
representatives of the Company. Section 3.11 of the Eagles Disclosure Schedule
lists all federal and state income Tax Returns filed with respect to
Eagles and all the Eagles Subsidiaries that have been audited, and indicates
those Tax Returns, if any, that currently are the subject of audit. No unpaid
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing
against Eagles or any of the Eagles Subsidiaries, including claims by any
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Eagles or any Eagles Subsidiary does
not file Tax Returns that Eagles or such Eagles Subsidiary is, or may be,
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, and no requests for waivers of any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes have been made and no extensions of
the time to assess or collect any such Tax are pending and no such waiver
remains in effect. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Eagles or
any Eagles Subsidiary except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due.
Neither Eagles nor any of the Eagles Subsidiaries is a party to or subject of
any audit, examination, action or proceedings by any taxing authority for
assessment or collection of any Tax, to the knowledge of Eagles no audit,
examination, action or proceeding in respect of Taxes involving Eagles or any
Eagles Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority, and no claim for
assessment or collection of any Tax has been assessed against Eagles or any
Eagles Subsidiary.

(b) For the purpose of this Agreement, (i) the term "Tax" or "Taxes" shall
mean any federal, state, local or foreign income, gross receipts, license,
payroll, employment, excise, severance, windfall profits, environmental
(including taxes under Code Section 59A), franchise, profits, withholding,
social security (or similar), unemployment, disability, real property,
personal property, sales, use, transfer, rollback, registration, value added,
alternative or ad-on minimum, estimated, or other tax of any kind whatsoever,
including any interest, penalty, or addition thereto, whether disputed or not
or additional amount imposed by any governmental authority or any obligation
to pay Taxes imposed on any entity for which a party to this Agreement is
liable as a result of any indemnification provision or other contractual
obligation, and (ii) the term "Tax Return" shall mean any return, declaration,
report, claim for refund, or information return, or similar statement relating
to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any
amendment thereof.

(c) Eagles and each of the Eagles Subsidiaries have withheld and paid within
the time and manner prescribed by law all Taxes required to have been withheld
and/or paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, former
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third
party. 

(d) Neither Eagles nor any of the Eagles Subsidiaries (i) has requested,
received or is subject to any written ruling of a taxing authority related to
Taxes or has entered into any written and legally binding agreement with a
taxing authority relating to Taxes or (ii) has engaged in any reportable or
listed transactions, as defined in Code Section 6011 and applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations, or in any transaction of which it has made (or was
required to make) disclosure to any Taxing authority to avoid the imposition
of any penalties.



 

10 (e) Neither Eagles nor any of the Eagles Subsidiaries has made any payments,
are obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an agreement that could
obligate them to make any payments that will not be deductible under Code
Sections 162(m) or 280G.

(f) Eagles has incurred no liability for any Taxes under Code Sections 1374,
857(b), 860(c) or 4981, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337-6 (or any provision of
similar effect) including, without limitation, any Tax arising from a
prohibited transaction described in Code Section 857(b)(6). Neither Eagles nor
any Eagles Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than
in the ordinary course of business. No event has occurred, and no condition
or circumstance exists (including the current holding by Eagles or any Eagles
Subsidiary of any asset the disposition of which would be subject to the
preceding provisions) which presents a risk that any material Tax described
in the preceding two sentences will be imposed on Eagles or any Eagles
Subsidiary.

(g) Neither Eagles nor any of the Eagles Subsidiaries (i) is a party to or is
otherwise subject to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of another person under law, by contract
or otherwise.

(h) Eagles (i) has operated since January 1, 2006 (" _Eagles Initial REIT
Year_ ") to the date hereof, and will continue to operate in such a manner as
to permit it to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ")
within the meaning of Code Section 856 through the Effective Time, and (ii)
has not taken (or omitted to take) any action that could reasonably be
expected to result in a challenge to its qualification as a REIT and no
challenge to Eagles qualification as a REIT is pending or to Eagles
knowledge is or has been threatened. Each direct or indirect Eagles
Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company
has since its acquisition by Eagles (A) been classified and treated for
federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity and not
as a corporation or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Code Section 7704(b) that is treated as a corporation under Code Section
7704(a), and (B) not owned any assets (including, without
limitation, securities) that would cause Eagles to violate Code Section
856(c)(4). Each Eagles Subsidiary which is a corporation, and each other
issuer of securities in which Eagles holds securities (within the meaning of
Code Section 856(c) but excluding securities of issuers described in Code

forfeited or otherwise relinquished any Intellectual Property which
forfeiture has resulted in, individually or in the aggregate, or would result
in an Eagles Material Adverse Effect. The use of the Intellectual Property by

violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any right, title,
interest or goodwill, including, without limitation, any intellectual property
right, trademark, trade name, patent, service mark, brand mark, brand name,
computer program, database, industrial design, copyright or any pending
application therefor, of any other Person, and there have been no claims made

Eagles Subsidiaries has received any notice of any claim or otherwise has

ARTICLE IV

_Representations and Warranties of the Company and MergerCo_

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered at or prior to the
execution hereof which disclosure schedule identifies exceptions only by the
specific Section or subsection to which each entry relates or to any other
Section or subsection to which the applicability of the exception is readily
apparent on its face (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company and
MergerCo hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Eagles as
follows:

4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Compliance with Law._

(a) Each of the Company and MergerCo is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation. Except as set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and MergerCo is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under
the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification or  



 

15  licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and MergerCo has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber
its assets and carry on its business as now conducted.

(b) Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company listed in Section 4.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a
corporation, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Except as set
forth in Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its
property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or
licensing, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified,
licensed or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each Company Subsidiary has all requisite corporate or other power and
authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its assets and carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company has no other Subsidiaries other than
the Company Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any predecessors other than as set forth on Section 4.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation of
any order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or
tribunal, or any law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets is subject, where such violation, alone or together with all other
violations, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses,
permits and other authorizations and have taken all actions required by
applicable law or governmental regulations in connection with their businesses
as now conducted, except where the failure to obtain any such license, permit
or authorization or to take any such action, alone or together with all other
such failures, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(d) The Company has previously provided or made available to Eagles true and
complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws and the other
charter documents, bylaws, organizational documents and partnership, limited
liability company, trust agreements and joint venture agreements (and in each
such case, all amendments thereto) of the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

4.2 _Authorization, Takeover Laws, Validity and Effect of Agreements._ Each of
the Company and MergerCo has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and perform its obligations hereunder. Subject only to the
approval of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Shares, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company and MergerCo of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on behalf of the
Company and MergerCo. In connection with the foregoing, the Company Board and
the Board of Directors of MergerCo have taken such actions and votes as are
necessary on their part to render the provisions of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or any other anti-takeover statute
or similar federal or state statute inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement,
assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Eagles,
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company and
MergerCo, enforceable against the Company and MergerCo in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by
general principles of equity.

be subject to any outstanding judgment, order, restraining order, and/or
injunction (temporary or otherwise), decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or
other Governmental Entity or other legal restraint or prohibition, or is party
to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding
that materially restricts the conduct of its business or that relates to
policies, affairs, managements or its business, except any such judgments,
orders, injunctions, decrees, statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations
or restrictions that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.8 _SEC Reports._ Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has timely filed (and, from the date hereof
until the Closing Date, will timely file) all required forms and reports (and
all certificates required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"))
with the SEC since December 31, 2003 (collectively, the " _Company SEC
Reports_ "), all of which were (and will be) prepared in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
_"Securities Laws"_ ). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports
(a) complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and (b) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
of the consolidated balance sheets of the Company included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) complied as to form, as of their report filing dates, in all
material respects with the Securities Laws and fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
income, retained earnings and cash flows of the Company included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material  



 

18  respects the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows, as the
case may be, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the periods
set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein and except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q pursuant to
Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for normal year-end audit
adjustments which would not be material in amount or effect. To the knowledge
of the Company, there are no outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports. No Company Subsidiary is
required to make any filing with the SEC. The Company has established and
maintains a system of "disclosure controls and procedures" and "internal
control over financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in paragraphs
(e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _US GAAP_ "),
consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys
assets. As of December 31, 2005, (x) there were no "material weaknesses" (as
defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) and (y) there was
no series of multiple "significant deficiencies" (as defined by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board) that was reasonably likely to collectively
represent a "material weakness" in the design or operation of the Companys
internal controls. Since December 31, 2005, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, the Companys independent
auditors, have identified or been made aware of (A) any material weakness in
the system of internal controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys management
or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements
or the internal controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (C)
any material claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

The Company has provided Eagles true and complete copies of all management
letters received from its independent auditors since December 31, 2003, and
if no such management letters have been received, the Company has provided
copies of all correspondence from its independent auditors during such period
relating to subject matter of the same type as would be included in a
management letter. 

There are no liabilities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, known or unknown, whether or not accrued and whether or not
contingent or absolute, other than (i) liabilities disclosed in the Companys
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 included in the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended such date and (ii)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since such date, none of which are reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

4.9 _Litigation._ Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports or in Section
4.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (a) there is no suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (b)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any
outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Entity or the person which, in the case of (a) or (b), would, individually or
in the aggregate, (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger, (ii) otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by the Company
of any of its obligations under this Agreement or (iii) reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth any suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation that is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any outstanding
order, writ, judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity or
other person against the Company or any Company Subsidiary.



 

19 The Company and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Company Permits_
"), except for failures to hold such Company Permits that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries are
in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure
so to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries have not been and are not
being conducted in violation of any law except for violations that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened,
nor has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to conduct any such
investigation or review, other than, in each case, where the outcome would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

4.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports or in Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from December
31, 2005 through the date hereof, there has not been a Company Material
Adverse Effect and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted
their businesses only in the ordinary course of business and there has not
been any action contemplated by Section 5.2.

4.11 _Taxes._ Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule:

(a) For the taxable year commencing with their respective dates of formation
(the " _Company Initial Tax Year_ "), and each taxable year thereafter, each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed all Tax
Returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any
filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity have authority to
do so), and all such Tax Returns and reports are true, accurate and complete
in all material respects, and (ii) has paid (or the Company has paid on its
behalf) within the time and manner prescribed by law, all Taxes. The most
recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Documents reflect an
adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by the Company and each
Company Subsidiary for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has established (and through the Closing Date will continue to
establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves in accordance with
GAAP that are adequate for the payment of all material liabilities for Taxes
accruing through the period covered by such books and records. True, correct
and complete copies of all federal, state and local Tax Returns for the
Company and each Company Subsidiary and all written communications with any
taxing authority relating to such Tax Returns requested by Eagle or its
representatives have been delivered or made available to representatives of
Eagles. Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all federal and
state income Tax Returns filed with respect to the Company and all the Company
Subsidiaries that have been audited, and indicates those Tax Returns, if any,
that currently are the subject of audit. No unpaid deficiencies for any Taxes
have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or such Company Subsidiary is, or may be, subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction, and no requests for waivers of any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes have been made and no extensions of the
time to assess or collect any such Tax are pending and no such waiver remains
in effect. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or subject of
any audit, examination, action or proceedings by any taxing authority for
assessment or collection of any Tax, to the knowledge of the Company no audit,
examination, action or proceeding in respect of Taxes involving the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority, and no
claim for assessment or collection of any Tax has been assessed against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(b) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have withheld and paid
within the time and manner prescribed by law all Taxes required to have
been withheld and/or paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, former employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or
other third party.

(c) The Company has no class of outstanding stock that is not regularly traded
on an established securities market under Code Section 1445(b)(6).

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) has requested,
received or is subject to any written ruling of a taxing authority related to
Taxes or has entered into any written and legally binding  



 

20  agreement with a taxing authority relating to Taxes or (ii) has engaged in
any reportable or listed transactions, as defined in Code Section 6011 and
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, or in any transaction of which it has
made (or was required to make) disclosure to any Taxing authority to avoid the
imposition of any penalties.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) is a party to
or is otherwise subject to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or (ii)
has any liability for the Taxes of another person under law, as a transferee
or successor, by contract or otherwise.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has made any
payments, are obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an agreement
that could obligate them to make any payments that will not be deductible
under Code Sections 162(m) or 280G.

(g) The Company has incurred no liability for any Taxes under Code Sections
1374, 857(b), 860(c) or 4981, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337-6 (or any provision of
similar effect) including, without limitation, any Tax arising from a
prohibited transaction described in Code Section 857(b)(6). Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for
Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. No event has occurred,
and no condition or circumstance exists (including the current holding by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of any asset the disposition of which would
be subject to the preceding provisions) which presents a risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding two sentences will be imposed on the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(h) The Company (i) for each of its taxable years commencing with its taxable
year beginning on January 1, 2004 (the "Companys Initial REIT Year") has
been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Code Section 856 and
has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years (ii) has
operated since December 31, 2005 to the date hereof, and will continue to
operate, in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT,
and (iii) has not taken (or omitted to take) any action that could reasonably
be expected to result in a challenge to its qualification as a REIT and no
challenge to the Companys qualification as a REIT is pending or to the
Companys knowledge is or has been threatened. Each direct or indirect Company
Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company
has since its acquisition by the Company (A) been classified and treated for
federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity and not as
a corporation or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Code
Section 7704(b) that is treated as a corporation under Code Section 7704(a),
and (B) not owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that
would cause the Company to violate Code Section 856(c)(4). Each Subsidiary of
the Company which is a corporation, and each other issuer of securities in
which the Company holds securities (within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)
but excluding securities of issuers described in Code Section 856(m)) having
a value of more than 10 percent of the total value of the outstanding
securities of such issuer has since its acquisition by the Company been a
REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary of the Company under Code Section 856(i),
or a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company under Code Section 856(l). Section
4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all the Company Subsidiaries
which are (i) "taxable REIT subsidiaries" within in the meaning of Code
Section 856(l) or (ii) "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of
Code Section 856(i).

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has distributed stock of
another person, or has had its stock distributed by another person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Code Section 355\. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
has disposed of any property in a transaction intended to qualify for tax
deferred treatment under Code Sections 1031 or 1033.

(j) The Company does not have any earnings and profits attributable to it or
any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of Code Section
857\. To the Companys knowledge (after due investigation), (A) it is a
"domestically controlled REIT" within the meaning of Code Section 897(h) and
(B) is not nor has it been at any time a "United States real property holding
corporation" as such term is defined in Code Section 897(c)(2).

(k) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any
action or failed to take any action, or is aware of any circumstance, that
would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Code Section 368(a).



 

21 4.12 _Assets_. The Company owns all of the assets set forth in Section 4.12 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _the Company Assets_ ")
free and clear of any Encumbrances, except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

4.13 _Environmental Matters._ Except as set forth in Section 4.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or as would otherwise not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (a) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and have
been, in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and permits and
authorizations thereunder; (b) there is no administrative or
judicial enforcement proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of the Company
threatened, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary involving Hazardous
Materials or toxic fungi or mold or arising under any Environmental Law; (c)

Company, any legal predecessor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, has

damage or for damages to natural resources, as those terms are defined under
the Environmental Laws, at any location; (d) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has transported or disposed of, or allowed or arranged for
any third party to transport or dispose of, any waste containing Hazardous
Materials at any location identified as requiring response action on the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information
System or similar state database or any location proposed for inclusion on
such lists; (e) the Company has no knowledge of any release on the real
property owned or leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
predecessor entity of Hazardous Materials that would be reasonably likely to
result in a requirement under any Environmental Laws to perform a response
action, the incurrence of natural resource damages or in any material
liability under the Environmental Laws; and (f) to the knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is required, by virtue
of the transactions contemplated hereby, or as a condition to the
effectiveness of any transactions contemplated hereby, (i) to perform a
site assessment for Hazardous Materials, (ii) to remove or remediate
Hazardous Materials, (iii) to give notice to or receive approval from any
governmental authority, or (iv) to record or deliver to any Person any
disclosure document or statement pertaining to environmental matters.

4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans._

(a) Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
every material Employee Program, currently maintained or contributed to (or

that is intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) has received

requirements of applicable law, including, without limitation, ERISA and the
Code, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and has been and is being administered and operated
in all material respects in accordance with its terms. No Employee Program is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or is a multiemployer plan, within the meaning of
ERISA Section 3(37).

part of the Company of any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
employment relationship.

firm to pay any finders fees, brokerage or agents commissions or other like

America Securities LLC as its financial advisor in connection with the
Merger. The Company has furnished to Eagles a true, complete and correct copy

Merger result in any third party having any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration, or cancellation of or loss or change in a benefit

or licensed by the Company or its subsidiaries free and clear of any and all
Liens, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has forfeited or
otherwise relinquished any Intellectual Property which forfeiture has resulted
in, individually or in the aggregate, or would result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The use of the Intellectual Property by the Company or the

interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any right, title, interest or

therefor, of any other Person, and there have been no claims made against the

Company Subsidiaries has received any notice of any claim or otherwise has
knowledge that any of the Intellectual Property is invalid or conflicts with
the asserted rights of any other Person or has not been used or enforced or
has failed to have been used or enforced in a manner that would result in the
abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of any of the Intellectual
Property, except, in all such cases, as would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.25 _Investment Company Act of 1940._ Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries is, or at the Effective Time will be, required to be
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,

at all times to Eagles, the Companys and their respective trustees and
directors right and duty to act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary
duties, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as

order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to
consummate the Merger.

6.5 _No Solicitations._

Each of the Company and Eagles (as applicable, the "Party") shall comply with
the relevant provisions of this Section 6.5. The other party is referred to in
this Section 6.5 as the "Other Party."

(a) The Party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents to,
immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and
request the return or destruction of all confidential information regarding
the Party and its subsidiaries provided to any such persons on or prior to the
date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreements or otherwise. The Party shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees,
representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
participate in, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), or take any other action designed or reasonably likely to
facilitate or encourage, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations (including by
way of furnishing information) regarding any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
,  _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the Partys Shareholders
Meeting, the Board of Directors or Trustees of the Party determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that it is necessary to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Partys stockholders under applicable
law, the Party may, _provided_ that the Party has complied in all respects
with its obligations under this Section 6.5(a), in response to a Superior
Proposal received by the Party after the date hereof, and subject to
compliance with this Section 6.5, (x) furnish information with respect to the
Party and its subsidiaries to the person making such Superior Proposal
pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement no less restrictive on
the other party than the applicable Confidentiality Agreement and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Superior Proposal.

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5, neither the Board of Directors or
Trustees of the Party nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify,
or propose to withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation by such Board
of Directors or Trustees or such committee of the Offer, the Merger or this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend or take no position with respect to, or
propose to approve or recommend or take no position with respect to, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause the Party to enter into any agreement
related to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality and
standstill agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal as contemplated by
Section 6.5(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the Partys
Shareholders Meeting the Board of  



 

31  Directors or Trustees of the Party determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that it is required to do so in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Party under applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Party may, _provided_ that the Party has
complied in all respects with its obligations under this Section 6.5(b), in
response to a Superior Proposal that was received by the Party after the date
hereof, (x) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer,
the Merger or this Agreement or (y) subject to the provisions of Section
8.1(e) or (f), as applicable, hereof, terminate this Agreement, but in each
such case only at a time that is after the fifth business day following the
Other Partys receipt of written notice advising the Other Party that the
Board of Directors or Trustees of the Party has received a Superior Proposal
(after taking into account and considering any revised Acquisition Proposal
made by Eagles in light of such Superior Proposal), specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person
making such Superior Proposal, and only if the Party is in compliance with
this Section 6.5 and simultaneously with taking such action it also executes
a definitive agreement to implement such Superior Proposal.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal, offer or expression of interest by any third party relating
a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Party or
any subsidiary of the Party, or any purchase of more than 15% of the
consolidated assets of the Party (including the shares and assets of its
subsidiaries) or more than 15% of the shares of the Party (other the pursuant
to the exercise of Company Stock Options in accordance with their terms) or
the issuance of any securities (or rights to acquire securities) of the Party
or any subsidiary of the Party, or any similar transaction, or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding requiring the Party to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Any material modification of an Acquisition Proposal (including any
modification of the economic terms) shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
bona fide Acquisition Proposal for a transaction in which all of the stock or
assets of the Party are acquired by a third party, including by merger,
consolidation or other business combination, on terms that the Board of
Directors or Trustees of the Party determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be more favorable to the Partys stockholders, from a financial
point of view, than the Merger and the Repurchase Offer (taking into account
all aspects of the proposal, the party making the proposal and any changes to
the Merger and Repurchase Offer proposed by the Other Party in response to the
receipt by the Party of such Superior Proposal) and which is not subject to
any material contingency, including any contingency related to financing,
unless, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or Trustees of
the Party, such contingency is reasonably capable of being satisfied by such
third party, and that is otherwise reasonably capable of being consummated in
a timely fashion.

(d) The Party shall immediately advise the Other Party orally and in writing
of any request for information or of any Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal and the identity
of the person making such request or Acquisition Proposal. The Party will
immediately inform the Other Party of any material change in the details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
Acquisition Proposal. The Party will promptly provide the Other Party with
any documents received from any such person and promptly provide the Other
Party such information as it may reasonably request.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Party from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure
to the Partys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Party, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Party nor its Board of Directors or Trustees nor any
committee thereof shall, except as specifically permitted by Section 6.5(b),
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its position with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement or approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, a Acquisition Proposal.

6.6 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification._ (a) In the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
Eagles or any of the Eagles Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be,
made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or

employee, fiduciary or agent of Eagles or any of the Eagles Subsidiaries, or
is or was serving at the request of Eagles or any of the Eagles Subsidiaries
as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or
document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted
or arising at or before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree
to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Indemnified Party against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation,
and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising at or before or
after the Effective Time), (A) from and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and the Company shall promptly pay expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
within thirty (30) days after statements therefor are received, and (C) from
and after the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense
of any such matter _; provided, however,_ that neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Company shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided further_ that the Surviving
Corporation and the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6,
upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation
and the Company thereof _; provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not
affect the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Company except to
the extent, if any, such failure to promptly notify materially prejudices such
party.

 

(b) The Company and MergerCo each agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
Indemnified Party provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other
applicable organizational documents) of Eagles and the Eagles Subsidiaries or
otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, shall become the joint and several
obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and any applicable
Company Subsidiary _; provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. From and
after the Effective Time, the Company and MergerCo each also agree to jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of Eagles and the Eagles Subsidiaries in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any
written indemnification agreements between Eagles and/or one or more Eagles
Subsidiaries and such officers and directors as listed in Section 6.6(b) of
the Eagles Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a non-cancelable
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage for the Eagles directors and
officers, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for
six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage
presently maintained by Eagles. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6
applies without the consent of each such affected indemnitee. This Section
6.6 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party
beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
shall  



 

33  be binding on all successors of the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled
to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.6.

(e) In the event that, following the Effective Time, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation,
assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each
such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

6.7 _Public Announcements._ Eagles and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed _; provided, however,_ that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statement as may be required by law or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press release or
making such public statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to
do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties shall make a joint
public announcement of the Merger contemplated hereby no later than the
opening of trading on the NYSE on the Business Day following the date on which
this Agreement is signed.

6.8 _Employee Benefit Arrangements._

(a) On or prior to the Effective Time the Company will establish (subject to
obtaining any necessary shareholder approval) a Long-Term Incentive Plan
substantially similar to Eagles Long-term Incentive Plan as in effect on the
date of this Agreement. Such plan will initially provide for shares available
for awards under the plan equal to 3% of all Company Common Shares outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to secure any necessary approval by the holders of Company Common
Shares for the plan at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The terms of such
plan shall be subject to Eagles consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. The term "Company Stockholder Approval" shall include the approval
of the plan contemplated by this Section 6.8. The Company represents and
warrants that it has all power and authority to adopt the plan, including
having sufficient authorized but unissued Company Common Shares not otherwise
reserved for issuance.

(b) The Company shall take the actions reasonably requested by Eagles
with respect to employees. The Interim Manager shall have the right to
solicit for employment or hire employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement or any
other agreement to the contrary. 

6.9 _Certain Tax Matters._

(a) Eagles shall take all actions, and refrain from taking all actions, as are
necessary to ensure that Eagles will qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S.
federal income tax purposes for its tax year ending with the Merger. During
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Eagles
shall, and shall cause each Eagles Subsidiary, to facilitate all reasonable
requests of the Company with respect to maintenance of Eagles REIT status for
Eagles tax year ending with the Merger. Company shall take all actions, and
refrain from taking all actions, as are necessary to ensure that Company will
continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax

applicable Tax law). Eagles shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax  



 

34  Returns. Eagles shall provide to the Company copies of such Tax Returns that
are to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date at least 15 calendar days
prior to the due date of such Tax Returns (including applicable extensions).

Returns that are to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date at least 15
calendar days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns (including applicable

(c) Each of Eagles and the Company and their respective subsidiaries shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as
a "reorganization" under the provisions of Code Section 368(a) and to obtain
the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 7.1(f) and (g).

6.10 _Notice Obligations_.

(a) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify
Eagles in writing with respect to any matter hereafter arising or any
information obtained after the date hereof that, if existing, occurring or
known at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to

necessary to complete or correct any information in such schedule or in any
representation and warranty of the Company that has been rendered inaccurate
thereby or that would cause a condition to the closing hereof not to be
satisfied. The Company shall promptly inform Eagles of any claim by a third
party that a Contract has been breached, is in default, may not be renewed or

by this Agreement. For purposes of determining the satisfaction of the
conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, no
such supplement, amendment or information shall be considered. The
Company will consult with Eagles a reasonable time prior to making publicly
available its financial results or filing any document with the SEC.

(b) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Eagles shall notify the
Company in writing with respect to any matter hereafter arising or any

(c) by written notice from the Company to Eagles, (i) if Eagles breaches or
fails to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which

of the Companys decision to so terminate. Such notice shall indicate in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including the amount and form of the proposed consideration and whether such

8.2 _Effect of Termination._

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 8.2 and to Section 8.3, in the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of the Company, MergerCo or Eagles and their respective
directors, trustees, officers, employees, partners or stockholders and all

(Repurchase Option) and Article IX (General Provisions) _; provided, however,_
that nothing contained in this Section 8.2(a) shall relieve any party from
liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud or willful breach by such
party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Eagles pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
[Eagles Superior Proposal], or by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g)
[Eagle recommendation], then Eagles shall pay to the Company, subject to the
provisions of Section 8.4, an amount in cash equal to $3,300,000 (the "
_Break-up Fee_ "), or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) [Company
Superior Proposal], or by Eagles Section 8.1(h) [Company recommendation], then
the Company shall pay Eagles the Break-up Fee. If (A) prior to Eagles
Shareholder Meeting or the Company Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made (and not subsequently withdrawn),
(B) this Agreement is terminated other than by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c) [Eagles breach] or by Eagles pursuant to Section 8.1(d) [Company
breach] at a time when the Eagles Shareholder Approval or the Company
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, has not been obtained, and (C) Eagles or
the Company, as applicable, signs a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or consummates an Acquisition Proposal in each case
within twelve (12) months of such termination, then Eagles or the Company, as
applicable, shall pay to the other party the Break-up Fee. Payment of the
Break-up Fee required by this Section 8.2(b) shall be payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (1) in the case of termination of this
Agreement by Eagles under Section 8.1(e) [Superior Proposal] or the Company
under Section 8.1(f) [Superior Proposal], concurrently with the effective
date of such termination ( _i.e._ following the five Business Days waiting
period), (2) in the case of termination of this Agreement by the Company under
Section 8.1(c) or (g) [Eagles breach or recommendation] or by Eagles under
Section 8.1(d) or (h) [Company breach or recommendation], within three
Business Days after the date of termination or (3) in case of a situation
contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 8.2(b), immediately prior
to the execution of such definitive agreement or the consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any fees or
expenses paid to the Company or Eagles, as the case may be, pursuant to
Section 8.3 shall be deducted from the payment of any Break-up Fee required by
this Section 8.2(b).

8.3 _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as set forth in Section 8.2, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all
fees, costs and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and accountants
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses.

(b) If either party fails to pay the other any amounts due under Section 8.2
or 8.3, the party failing to make such payment shall pay the reasonable costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including, without limitation, the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment.

The payment of expenses set forth herein is not an exclusive remedy, but is in
addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties
hereto (whether at law or in equity).



 

39 8.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense._

(a) In the event that Eagles or the Company is obligated to pay the other the
Break-up Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (the " _Termination Amount_ "),
Eagles or the Company (the " _Payor_ ") shall pay to the other party (the "
_Payee_ ") from the applicable Termination Amount deposited into escrow in
accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
Termination Amount and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid
to the Payee without causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) determined as if the payment of such amount
did not constitute income described in Code Sections 856(c)(2)(H) or Code
856(c)(3)(I) (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the Payees
independent certified public accountants, plus (B) in the event the Payee
receives either (1) a letter from the Payees counsel indicating that the
Payee has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 8.4(b)(ii) or
(2) an opinion from the Payees outside counsel as described in Section
8.4(b)(ii), an amount equal to the Termination Amount less the amount payable
under clause (A) above. To secure the Payors obligation to pay these amounts,
the Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Payor and on such
terms (subject to Section 8.3(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Eagles,
the Company and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of
the Termination Amount pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) shall be made at the
time the Payor is obligated to pay the Payee the such amount pursuant to
Section 8.3 or Section 8.2(b), as applicable, by wire transfer or bank check.

 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Amount in escrow
or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Payee unless the escrow
agent receives any of the following: (i) a letter from the Payees independent
certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by
the escrow agent to the Payee without causing the Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter
from the Payees accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Payee, or (ii) a letter from the
Payees counsel indicating that the Payee received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by the Payee of the Termination Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) (or alternatively, the Payees
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by
the Payee of the Termination Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income
or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Code Sections
856(c)(2) and (3)), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder
of the Termination Amount to the Payee. The Payor agrees to amend this
Section 8.4 at the request of the Payee in order to (A) maximize the portion
of the Termination Amount that may be distributed to the Payee hereunder
without causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Code Sections
856(c)(2) and (3), (B) improve the Payees chances of securing a favorable
ruling described in this Section 8.3(b), or (C) assist the Company in
obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in
this Section 8.4(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion
of the Termination Amount held in escrow for five years shall be released by
the escrow agent to the Payor. The Payor shall not be a party to such
escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have liability resulting
from the escrow agreement.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the escrow provisions of clauses (a) and (b)
of this Section 8.4 shall only apply at the election of the relevant Payee,
such election to be made in its absolute discretion.

8.5 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Eagles
Shareholder Approval, as applicable _; provided, however,_ that after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by
such stockholders without obtaining such approval.

8.6 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such
waiver or extension is to be enforced. The failure of a party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.



 

40 8.7 _Repurchase Option_. Following the termination of the Interim Management
Agreement, Eagles or a subsidiary shall have the right, exercisable by
written notice to the Company within 30 days of termination, to purchase from
the Company or any subsidiary any asset, investment or right to acquire an
asset or investment acquired pursuant to or in connection with the Interim
Management Agreement at a price equal to the market value thereof as of the
date of such repurchase (which shall include assumptions of debt, if any, in
connection with such purchase) and otherwise on substantially the terms
acquired by the Company or such subsidiary. If the parties are not able to
agree on the market value, the matter shall be settled by an investment bank
of national reputation selected by the parties (or by lot among the top five
investment banks not retained by Eagles or the Company, as reported in the
most recent US mergers and acquisitions rankings by Thompson Financial Corp.
if the parties are unable to agree within 20 days), whose determination shall
be final and binding. The fees and expenses of such investment bank shall be
shared equally between the parties.

51 Exhibit 4

If the principal balance of the Peerless loan exceeds $8 million by July 31,
2006, the net book value of Sunset will be reduced by 60% of the difference
between $8 million and the outstanding principal balance and the exchange
ratio and per share redemption price will be adjusted commensurately, as
described in the Merger Agreement and illustrated below.

If there remains any principal balance in the East-West Commerce Center loan
on July 31, 2006, the net book value of Sunset will be reduced dollar-for-
dollar by the principal balance of the loan on that date. The outstanding
principal balance, exchange ratio, and per share redemption price will be
adjusted commensurately, as described in the Merger Agreement and illustrated
below.

The calculations are based on a total stockholders equity of $91,899.826
versus $106,997 at 12/31/05, derived as follows:



     |  |  | 
---|---|---|--- 
  

Total Stockholders Equity at 12/31/05:

 |  | $ | 106,997.247 
  

Less: Mortgage Backed Securities available for sale

 |  | $ | 5,661.000 
  

Less: Securitized hybrid rate adjustable mortgages

 |  | $ | 6,772.000 
  

Less: Fixed assets, net

 |  | $ | 520.748 
  

Plus: Interest rate swap agreements

 |  | $ | 4,813.327 
  

Less: Restructuring Charge and Merger Expenses

 |  | $ | 6,957.000 
   |  |  | 
  

Adjusted Stockholders Equity:

 |  | $ | 91,899.826 
 

With 10,516.900 shares outstanding the resulting book value per share is $8.74
($91,899.826 / 10,516.900 = $8.74). Alescos Shares are valued at $11 per
Share.

($ and shares in Thousands)

_Case 1: The Peerless Loan is not completely reduced_

The Peerless Loan has a current balance outstanding of $16,647. If this value
is reduced to $12,000 by July 31, 2006, this would be $4,000 above the target
value of $8,000 ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4000). The resulting adjustment to book
value would be made by subtracting $2,400 (60% * $4,000 = $2400). This would
result in a book value of $89,499.826 ($91,899.826 - $2,400 = $89,499.826).

The Adjusted Book Value would be $8.51 ($89,499.826 / 10,516.900 = $8.51).

The Exchange Ratio would then be 1.293. This is calculated by dividing
Alescos share price of $11 by the Adjusted Book Value of $8.51 ($11 / $8.51 =
1.293). 

The Repurchase Amount would then be $21,000 ($25,000 - $4,000 = $21,000)

_Case 2: The East West Loan is not completely reduced_

The East West Loan has a current balance outstanding of $2,739. If this value
is reduced to $1,000 by July 31, 2006, this would be $1,000 above the target
value of $ 0 ($2,739 - $1,739 = $1000). The resulting adjustment to book
value would be made by subtracting $1,000 (100% * $1,000 = $1000). This would
result in a book value of $90,899.826 ($91,899.826 - $1,000 = $90,899.826).

The Adjusted Book Value would be $8.64 (90,899.826 / 10,516.900 = $8.64).

The Exchange Ratio would then be 1.273. This is calculated by dividing
Alescos share price of $11 by the Adjusted Book Value of $8.64 ($11 / $8.51 =
1.273).

The Repurchase Amount would then be $24,000 ($25,000 - $1,000 = $24,000)
