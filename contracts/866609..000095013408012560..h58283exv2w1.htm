   ##### 

  

 

thereon thereafter, being referred to herein as the " _Escrow Funds_ "), and
will be deposited by Buyer in escrow with a commercial bank or other
financial institution located in Calgary, Canada duly authorized by
appropriate Governmental Authorities to exercise trust powers, which will act
as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent will be chosen by the mutual agreement of the
Parties. The Escrow Funds shall be available for a period of not longer than
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, for the purpose
of satisfaction of any claims made by Buyer for indemnification under
_Article 8_ of this Agreement and for certain adjustments that may be
required by _Section 1.5_ below;  _provided_ , _however_ , that amounts may
be required to be retained in escrow after such twelve-month period as
expressly provided in the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (ii) Amounts of any payments required pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the date of actual payment at the Interest Rate. 

  

 (iii) For purposes of federal, provincial, state and other Taxes based on income, except to the extent sums thereof are paid out to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Sellers shall be treated as the owners of the Escrow Funds and will report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow Funds, as their income in the Taxable year or years in which such income is properly includible, and pay any Taxes attributable thereto. 

  

 (b) _Adjustments_. The Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price will be subject to adjustment by the following: 

   

 (i) any and all transaction costs and expenses incurred or liabilities assumed by the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date relating to the Transactions, including but not limited to fees and expenses of financial advisory firms or brokers, outside legal fees and expenses, fees for tax advisory services and fees of outside accounting firms (" _Transaction Costs_ "); 

  

 (ii) the aggregate amount of all "change in control" or similar payment Liabilities paid or incurred by the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries as a result of the Transactions (" _Change in Control Liabilities_ "); 

  

 (iii) the Net Working Capital Adjustments (as defined in _Section 1.5(h)_ below); and 

  

 (iv) the amounts, if any, set forth in _Section 1.5(f)_, _(g)_ , _(i)_ ,  _(j)_ , _(k)_ and _(l)_ below. 

  

 (c) _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_. 

   

 (i) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Entities shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ ") based on the Acquired Entities books and records and other information then available, to be calculated in the same manner as the Closing Net Working Capital is determined. The Estimated Closing Net Working 

   ##### 

  

 

Capital shall, without limitation, specify the amount of any Pre-Closing
Shareholder Distributions. 

   

 (ii) At the Closing, if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is _less than_ CDN$58,873,500 (which amount represents the combined net working capital of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries as of April 30, 2008 plus CDN$1,043,000) (" _Target Net Working Capital_ "), the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital; and if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital _exceeds_ the Target Net Working Capital, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital. Such adjustments will be subject to the additional adjustments as set forth in _Section 1.5(h)_ below. The methodology used to calculate Target Net Working Capital is set forth in  _Schedule 1.5(c)(ii)_. 

  

 (d) _Estimated Transaction Costs, Change in Control Liabilities and Gross Rental Equipment Assets_. 

   

 (i) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Entities shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate, based on the Acquired Entities books and records and other information then available, of (x) Gross Rental Equipment Assets, (y) unpaid Transaction Costs, and (z) Change in Control Liabilities. 

  

 (ii) At the Closing, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced, dollar-for-dollar, by (x) an amount equal to the difference between CDN$35,000,000 and the amount of such estimated Gross Rental Equipment Assets if the amount of estimated Gross Rental Equipment Assets is below CDN$35,000,000, (y) unpaid Transaction Costs, and (z) Change in Control Liabilities. Such adjustments will be subject to the additional adjustments as set forth in  _Sections 1.5(f)_, _1.5(g)_ and _1.5(k)_ below. 

  

 (e) _Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), showing the amounts of: 

   

 (i) the Transaction Costs (if any) referred to in _Section 1.5(b)(i)_ above; 

  

 (ii) the aggregate Change in Control Liabilities (if any) referred to in _Section 1.5(b)(ii)_ ; 

  

 (iii) the Closing Net Working Capital (as defined herein) as of the Closing Date; 

  

 (iv) the outstanding Receivables and the Allowance for Doubtful Receivables of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date; 

  

 (v) the outstanding CSA Receivables of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date; 

   #####

The methodology to be used to determine the Target Net Working Capital
included in _Schedule 1.5(c)(ii)_ shall be used to determine the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Net Working Capital to be set
forth in the Closing Statement; _provided_ that the determination of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital
shall exclude the addition of CDN$1,043,000. 

   

 (f) _Transaction Costs_. If the actual unpaid Transaction Costs (if any) _exceed_ the estimated unpaid Transaction Costs, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the actual unpaid Transaction Costs exceed the estimated unpaid Transaction Costs (after taking into effect any payments in respect of estimated unpaid Transaction Costs pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ above), and such amount shall be payable to Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, out of the Escrow Funds. If the actual unpaid Transaction Costs are _less than_ the estimated unpaid Transaction Costs, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the estimated unpaid Transaction Costs exceed the actual unpaid Transaction Costs (after taking into effect any payments in respect of estimated unpaid Transaction Costs pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ above), and such amount shall be paid by Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, to the Sellers. 

   

 (g) _Change in Control Liabilities_. If the total amount of Change in Control Liabilities _exceeds_ the estimated Change in Control Liabilities, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the Change in Control Liabilities exceed the estimated Change in Control Liabilities (after taking into effect any payments in respect of estimated Change in Control Liabilities pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ above), and such amount shall be payable to Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, out of the Escrow Funds. If the Change in Control Liabilities are _less than_ the estimated Change in Control Liabilities, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the estimated Change in Control Liabilities exceed the Change in Control Liabilities (after taking into effect any payments in respect of estimated Change in Control Liabilities pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ above), and such amount shall be paid by Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, to the Sellers. 

   

 (h) _Closing Net Working Capital_. If the Target Net Working Capital _exceeds_ the Closing Net Working Capital, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital (after taking into effect any payments in respect of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)(ii)_ above), and such amount shall be payable to Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, out of the Escrow Funds. If the Target Net Working Capital is _less than_ the Closing Net Working Capital, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar-for-dollar, by the amount by which the 

   ##### 

  

   

Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital (after
taking into effect any payments in respect of Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)(ii)_ above), and such amount shall be
paid by Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, to the Sellers. The adjustments referred to
in _Section 1.5(c)_ above and this _Section 1.5(h)_ are referred to as the
" _Net Working Capital Adjustments_." 

   

 (i) _Receivables Collection History_. Following Closing, Buyer will cause the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries to use their respective Best Efforts to collect the outstanding Receivables in a manner that is consistent with the Ordinary Course of Business of such Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Promptly after that date which is six (6) months following the Closing Date, the Parties will review the collection history over such six-month period regarding the various outstanding Receivables accounts of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) as of the Closing Date as shown on the Closing Statement, and will compare the collection history of such accounts during such six-month period to the Allowance for Doubtful Receivables as of the Closing Date. To the extent that such collection history indicates that the Acquired Entities should have reserved a _greater_ amount in the Allowance for Doubtful Receivables than had been reserved as of the Closing Date, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced by such greater amount, and such amount shall be payable to Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, out of the Escrow Funds. To the extent that such collection history indicates that the Sellers and Acquired Entities had _over-reserved_ for the Allowance for Doubtful Receivables as of the Closing Date, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such over-reserved amount, and such amount shall be payable by Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, to the Sellers. 

   

 (j) _CSA Receivables Collection History_. Following Closing, Buyer will cause the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries to use their respective Best Efforts to collect the outstanding CSA Receivables and maximize net recoveries from equipment sales with respect to delinquent agreements (if any) in a manner that is consistent with the Ordinary Course of Business of such Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Promptly after that date which is eleven (11) months following the Closing Date, the Parties will review the (i) collection history and (ii) history of net recoveries from equipment sales of delinquent agreements (if any) (together, " _CSA Collections and Net Recoveries_ ") over such eleven-month period regarding the various outstanding current and non-current CSA Receivables accounts of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) as of the Closing Date as shown on the Closing Statement. To the extent that the aggregate amount of CSA Collections and Net Recoveries are _less than_ the aggregate amount of the current and non-current CSA Receivable accounts as shown on the Closing Statement, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount by which the aggregate amount of the current and non-current CSA Receivables accounts as shown on the Closing Statement exceeds the aggregate amount of CSA Collections and Net Recoveries, and such amount shall be payable to Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, out of the Escrow Funds. 

   

 (k) _Gross Rental Equipment Assets_. If the amount of Gross Rental Equipment Assets as of the Closing Date according to the Closing Statement is _less than_ CDN$35,000,000 and the amount by which CDN$35,000,000 exceeds the amount of Gross Rental Equipment Assets is greater than the payment, if any, made with respect to the estimate of Gross Rental 

   ##### 

  

   

Equipment Assets pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ above, then the Cash
Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
difference between such excess amount and such payment, and the amount of
such difference shall be paid, dollar-for-dollar, to Buyer out of the Escrow
Funds. If the amount of Gross Rental Equipment Assets as of the Closing Date
according to the Closing Statement is _less than_ CDN$35,000,000 and the
amount by which CDN$35,000,000 exceeds the amount of Gross Rental Equipment
Assets as of the Closing Date is less than the payment made with respect to
the estimate of Gross Rental Equipment Assets pursuant to _Section
1.5(d)_ above, then the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase
Price shall be increased by the difference between such payment and such
excess amount, and the amount of such difference shall be paid by Buyer,
dollar-for-dollar to Sellers. 

   

 (l) _Income Tax Receivables_. On or before the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties shall have completed their review of (i) the Income Tax Receivables account of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries, and (ii) the extent that (A) amounts with respect to such Income Tax Receivables have been refunded and paid by the appropriate Governmental Authorities to Buyer, the Acquired Entities or their Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008, and (B) the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries have not otherwise monetarily realized the full amount of such Income Tax Receivables as of December 31, 2008. To the extent that the total aggregate amount of such refunds, payments and other realizations with respect to such Income Tax Receivables are _less than_ the aggregate amount of Income Tax Receivables as of the Closing Date, the Cash Consideration portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which the aggregate amount of Income Tax Receivables as of the Closing Date exceeds the total aggregate amount of such refunds, payments and other realizations with respect to such Income Tax Receivables pursuant to the preceding sentence, and such amount shall be payable to Buyer, dollar-for-dollar, out of the Escrow Funds. Sellers agree that they will cooperate and use their Best Efforts to assist Buyer, the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries to seek and obtain any such refunds, payments or other realizations. 

   

 (m) _Construction_. Any amounts payable by the Parties hereunder as Aggregate Purchase Price adjustments as provided for in this _Section 1.5_ shall not be subject to the terms of  _Article 8_ of this Agreement and the provisions limiting rights to indemnification as set forth therein. Amounts taken into account in determining increases or reductions in the Aggregate Purchase Price in this _Section 1.5_ will not be deemed to be "Damages" for purposes of the indemnification provisions of _Article 8_ hereof. 

   

 (n) _Access_. Following the Closing Date, each Party shall permit the other Parties and their independent accounting firm access, upon reasonable notice and during reasonable business hours, to review such Partys work papers and the books and records of each Acquired Entity and their Subsidiaries relevant to the items covered by the Closing Statement, and each Party shall permit such accountants to perform such tests as they may reasonably require to confirm the accuracy thereof. 

   

 (o) _Payment_. Any payment required to be made by any of the Parties to the other(s) under this _Section 1.5_ that is not made subject to the dispute and dispute resolution procedures pursuant to _Section 1.6_ below shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the delivery of the Closing 

   ##### 

  

   

Statement. The amount of any such payment shall bear interest from the Closing
Date through the date of actual payment at the rate per annum referred to in
_Section 1.5(a)(ii)_ above, and such accrued interest amount shall be
included with such payment. 

   

 1.6 Disputes and Dispute Resolution Procedures. 

  

 (a) In the event that the Sellers dispute any matter or matters on the Closing Statement, Sellers may within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of the Closing Statement (or fifteen (15) Business Days after that date which is six (6) months after the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 1.5(j)_ above), notify Buyer of such dispute in a writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such dispute and the facts upon which it is based, together with the adjustments proposed by Sellers, the application or treatment proposed by Sellers and the reasons supporting the use of such application or treatment rather than that used by Buyer. If both the Closing Statement as delivered by Buyer to Sellers and the Closing Statement adjustments as proposed by Sellers would require a payment by Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.5_, then, notwithstanding the amount in dispute (which shall be resolved in accordance with _Sections 1.6(b)-(e)_ below), payment of the undisputed portion of such amount will be paid to Buyer from the Escrow Funds within five (5) Business Days of delivery to Buyer of Sellers notice and proposed Closing Statement adjustments, together with interest thereon as provided by _Section 1.5(p)_. If both the Closing Statement as delivered by Buyer to Sellers and the Closing Statement adjustments as proposed by Sellers would require a payment by Buyer pursuant to  _Section 1.5_, then, notwithstanding the amount in dispute (which shall be resolved in accordance with _Sections 1.6(b)-(e)_ below), payment of the undisputed portion of such amount will be paid by Buyer to Sellers within five (5) Business Days of delivery to Buyer of Sellers notice and proposed Closing Statement adjustments, together with interest thereon as provided by _Section 1.5(p)_. If no such notice is given by Sellers within the time period specified, the Closing Statement shall be deemed accepted by Sellers. 

   

 (b) In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to any amount remaining in dispute pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ above within the ten (10) Business Day period after Sellers delivery to Buyer of Sellers notice of dispute and proposed Closing Statement adjustments, then Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall each promptly nominate (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the expiration of the ten-Business Day period referred to above in this sentence) an authorized senior management representative to use Best Efforts to resolve such amount(s) in dispute on or before the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of such nomination. If such representatives fail to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt of the notice of dispute from Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, then either Party may elect to refer such remaining issues to a neutral accounting firm for resolution pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 1.6(c)_. 

   

 (c) If the Parties have not resolved all matters in dispute relating to the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, then either Party may notify the other in writing that it elects to submit all remaining issues to resolution by a neutral independent accounting firm of national reputation in Canada and the U.S. Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice of election by a Party, the Parties shall agree upon the selection of a neutral accounting firm or, if they are unable to agree, Sellers and Buyer shall each submit to the other a list of the names of two neutral firms and, if the same name appears on both lists, such firm shall 

   ##### 

  

   

be selected. A firm shall be considered neutral if it has not within the past
three (3) years performed and does not currently perform or contemplate
performing any accounting, consulting or other services having an aggregate
value in excess of CDN$50,000 for any of the Parties and their respective
Affiliates. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on an accounting
firm of national reputation that is neutral, then either Party may apply to
the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta for the appointment of a qualified
neutral accountant. 

   

 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable, the firm selected shall resolve all matters remaining in dispute solely on the basis of the provisions of _Section 1.5_ and this _Section 1.6_. Such firm shall not be required to follow any particular rules of procedure, it being the intention of the Parties to create a feasible, practical and expeditious method for resolving any disagreement hereunder. In this regard, the Parties agree to use their Best Efforts to enter into any "agreed-upon-procedures" agreement or similar arrangement with such accounting firm to assist in such resolution. The failure of the Parties to enter into such an agreement will not prevent or delay such firm from proceeding to decide the matters in dispute. The decision of such firm hereunder shall be final and binding and shall not be subject to review or challenge of any kind. The appropriate Party (or Parties) shall pay to the other(s) any disputed amount that is determined to be due and owing within five (5) Business Days after such determination, together with interest thereon as provided by _Section 1.5(o)_. The fees and expenses of such firm shall be borne equally by the Parties. If the appropriate Party (or Parties, as the case may be) does not timely pay the amount due plus interest as required by the foregoing, then the accounting firms decision may be treated as an arbitration award, and the prevailing Party or Parties may seek to enforce the decision as a final and binding arbitration award. 

   

 (e) If the Parties resolve all matters in dispute relating to the Closing Statement, then the Closing Statement shall be adjusted as required by the agreement resolving the matters in dispute, and the Closing Statement as so modified shall be deemed accepted by Buyer and Seller. 

   

 1.7 Requisite Sellers. All references in this Agreement to actions to be taken by, or consents or approvals to be obtained from "the Sellers" under this Agreement shall mean the collective act of the Sellers, and not of each Seller individually. Any such action, consent or approval shall be deemed taken and obtained if at least two of the three individual Sellers (one of whom, in any event, must be Donald G. Chamberlain (" _Donald Chamberlain_ ") or his personal representative(s)) have so acted, consented or approved, and shall be deemed denied or rejected if at least two of the three individual Sellers (one of whom, in any event, must be Donald Chamberlain or his legal representative) have so denied or rejected such act, consent or approval, which actions, consents and approvals so effected or rejected shall be valid and binding acts of, and enforceable against, all of the Sellers and their respective heirs, successors, assigns, estates and personal representatives, and Buyer and the Sellers shall conclusively be entitled to rely thereon. 

  

 1.8 Exchange Rate. The "Exchange Rate" for purposes of this Agreement shall be the daily average of the closing rates published by Bloomberg L.P.- New York Composite  5:30 PM U.S. Eastern Time from the thirteenth (13th) Business Day preceding the Closing Date through the third Business Day preceding the Closing Date.

Each Seller will refer all customer inquiries relating to the businesses of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries to Buyer from and after the Closing.

herein to the contrary, either Party may disclose the "tax treatment"
and "tax structure" (as those terms are defined in Treas. Reg. Sections

 5.5 Restrictive Covenants. To assure that Buyer and the Acquired Entities will realize the benefits of the Transactions, Donald Chamberlain hereby agrees not to: 

  

 (a) From the Closing Date until that date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, alone or as a partner, joint venturer, officer, director, member, employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or Equity Interest holder of, or lender to, any Person or business, engage in the business of manufacturing, selling or leasing seismic data acquisition or processing equipment or technology (the " _Relevant Business_ ") anywhere in (i) Canada, (ii) the United Arab Emirates, (iii) Russia, (iv) China, (v) India or (vi) the United States. 

  

 (b) From the Closing Date until that date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly (A) induce any Person that is a customer of Buyer, any of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates to patronize any business directly or indirectly in competition with the Relevant Business conducted by Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates; (B) canvass, solicit or accept from any Person who is a customer of Buyer, either of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates, any such competitive business; or (C) with respect to the Relevant Business, request or advise any Person who is a customer or vendor of Buyer, either of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates, to withdraw, curtail or cancel any such customers or vendors business with such Person; provided, however, that a general solicitation or advertisement originating outside of and not specifically targeted to or reasonably expected to target the territory as to which such Seller is restricted from under this Agreement at such time shall not be deemed in and of itself to violate the prohibitions of (A) or (B) of this subparagraph. 

  

 (c) From the Closing Date until that date that is six months after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly employ or knowingly permit any Affiliate of such Seller to employ any person who was employed by Buyer with respect to the Relevant Business, either of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates within the prior six months. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) From the Closing Date until that date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit for employment by such Seller, his Affiliates or anyone else, any employee or then currently active independent contractor with respect to the Relevant Business of Buyer, either of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates, or any person who was an employee or then currently active independent contractor of Buyer, either of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates, within the six-month period immediately preceding such solicitation of employment, other than such person (1) whose employment or independent contractor relationship was terminated by the applicable Person, or (2) who independently responded to a general solicitation for employment by such Seller or such Sellers Affiliate; or (B) induce or attempt to induce, any employee or independent contractor with respect to the Relevant Business of Buyer, either of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates, to terminate such employees employment or independent contractors active contractual relationship with such Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the beneficial ownership of less than 3% of the
Equity Interests of any Person having a class of Equity Interest actively
traded on a Canadian or U.S. securities exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market
shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to Breach the prohibitions of this
_Section 5.5_. Donald Chamberlain agrees and acknowledges that
the restrictions in this _Section 5.5_ are reasonable in scope and duration
and are necessary to protect Buyer and the Acquired Entities and their
Subsidiaries after the Closing. If Donald Chamberlain is found to have
Breached this _Section 5.5_, then, in addition to all other remedies that
may be available to Buyer, an amount of time equal to the period Donald
Chamberlain was found to be in Breach of this _Section 5.5_ shall be added
to the time periods contemplated by this _Section 5.5_. If any provision of
this _Section 5.5_, as applied to any Party or to any circumstance, is
adjudged by a Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator not to be
enforceable in accordance with its terms, the same will in no way affect
any other circumstance or the enforceability of the remainder of this
Agreement. If any such provision, or any part thereof, is held not to be
enforceable in accordance with its terms because of the duration of such
provision, the area covered thereby, or the scope of the activities covered,
Donald Chamberlain and Buyer agree that the Governmental Authority, arbitrator
or mediator making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration, area and/or scope of activities of such provision, and/or to delete
specific words or phrases, and in its reduced form, such provision shall then
be Enforceable and shall be enforced. Donald Chamberlain and Buyer agree and
acknowledge that the Breach of this _Section 5.5_ will cause irreparable
Damage to Buyer and the Acquired Entities and upon breach of any provision of
this _Section 5.5_, Buyer and/or either of the Acquired Entities shall be
entitled to injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief
without bond or other security; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
remedies shall in no way limit any other remedies which Buyer and/or any of
the Acquired Entities may have. 

  

The Parties acknowledge that certain covenants of this nature will be
contained in the Employment Agreements of certain of the other Sellers.

 10.8 Time. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.

 10.10 Headings. The article and section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

The word "including" means "including without limitation." The Parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has Breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has not Breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in Breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. The representations, warranties, and covenants of each of the Sellers contained in this Agreement are joint and several obligations; this means that each Seller will be responsible to the extent provided in _Article 8_ above for the entirety of any Damages or other adverse consequences Buyer may suffer as a result of any Breach thereof. With respect to any future period of time that is to expire a number of months following a particular referenced date ( _e.g._ , a period that will expire on a date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date), such period of time shall be deemed to expire on the same corresponding day as the particular referenced date in the last month in such period of time ( _e.g._ , a period that will expire on a date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date, assuming that the Closing Date occurs on July 15, 2008, would mean that the period expires on January 15, 2009). If such date is not a Business Day, the expiration date shall be the next succeeding Business Day after such date.

The single arbitrator, or the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall preside over the arbitration. Each arbitrator shall have sufficient relevant experience to consider the subject matter of the dispute. 

  

 (iii) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the arbitration shall take place within sixty (60) days after the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, are appointed. The arbitration hearing shall be held on consecutive Business Days.

 (v) The arbitration shall include the presentation of evidence and examination of witnesses at an oral hearing. The hearing shall be conducted to preserve its privacy and to allow reasonable procedural due process. Rules of evidence need not be strictly followed, and the hearing shall be streamlined. Documents shall be self-authenticating, subject to valid objection by the opposing Party. Expert reports, witness biographies, depositions, and affidavits may be utilized, subject to the opposing Partys right to a live cross-examination of the witness in person. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, shall control the scheduling and conduct of the proceedings. 

  

 (vi) The decision of the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, shall include a statement specifying in reasonable detail the basis for and computation of the award, if any. The award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, shall be final, shall not constitute a basis for collateral estoppel as to any issue in any other legal or arbitration 

   ##### 

  

    

proceeding, and shall not be subject to vacation or modification. Judgment
upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 

  

 (vii) No Party shall be precluded hereby from securing equitable remedies in courts of any jurisdiction, including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, to protect its rights and interests, but no Party shall seek any such equitable remedies as a means to avoid or stay arbitration. 

  

 (viii) The Parties other than the Party that substantially prevails (the " _Prevailing Party_ ") in the arbitration shall share equally the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, fees for the arbitration. The Prevailing Party shall be entitled, as a component of the arbitration award, to reimbursement of its costs and expenses including reasonable legal fees. In the event that the arbitration award fails to clarify which (if any) Party has substantially prevailed, then the Parties agree that the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction for purposes of clarifying, upon request of either Party, such determination and any resulting allocation of costs, fees or expenses. 

  

 (c) The Parties desire that any arbitration should be conducted in strict confidence and that, subject to the exceptions set out in this paragraph, there shall be no disclosure to any Person of the existence of the dispute or any aspect of the dispute except as is necessary for the resolution of the dispute or as required by applicable Law. The arbitration shall be attended only by counsel and by those Persons whose presence, in the opinion of any Party or the arbitrator or arbitrators, is reasonably necessary for the resolution of the dispute. All matters relating to, all evidence presented at and all submissions made in the course of an arbitration, and all documents produced in accordance with this _Section 10.17_ or created in the course of or for the purposes of an arbitration, as well as any arbitral award, shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed to any Person without the prior written consent of the other Party except as is necessary for the resolution of the dispute, as required to enforce the arbitral award, or as required by applicable Law or by an order of the arbitrator or arbitrators made pursuant to a motion or application on notice to all Parties.
