Agreement. Any reference to any federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed
also to refer to such Law as amended and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless

Parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have

which the Party has not Breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in
Breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. The representations, warranties, and

this means that each Seller will be responsible to the extent provided in <U>Article&nbsp;8</U> above

Breach thereof. With respect to any future period of time that is to expire a number of months

a period that will expire on a date that is six (6)&nbsp;months following the Closing Date, assuming
that the Closing Date occurs on July&nbsp;15, 2008, would mean that the period expires on January&nbsp;15,

10.17</U>. The resolution of disputes pursuant to the terms of this <U>Section&nbsp;10.17</U> shall be
final and binding upon the Parties and there shall be no appeal therefrom, including any appeal to
a court of law on a question of law, a question of fact, or a question of mixed fact and law. The
arbitration shall take place in Calgary, Alberta in accordance with the following procedures:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;An arbitration shall be commenced by either Party delivering a request for arbitration
(the &#147;<B><I>Arbitration Request</I></B>&#148;) to the other Party. The Arbitration Request shall include in the text
or in one or more attachments: (i)&nbsp;a demand that the dispute be referred to arbitration in
accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;10.17</U>; (ii)&nbsp;a general description of the dispute; (iii)&nbsp;the
relief or remedy sought; and (iv)&nbsp;the name of the Person the Party submitting the Arbitration
Request nominates as an arbitrator.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Sellers and Buyer shall in good faith attempt to agree on a single arbitrator within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the demand for arbitration. If the Parties fail to agree on a single
arbitrator within the thirty-day period, then within ten (10)&nbsp;further days each Party shall select
a single arbitrator, who shall together within ten further days select a third arbitrator (and if
no such third arbitrator can be selected, the Parties may refer such selection of the third
arbitrator to the Court of Queen&#146;s Bench of Alberta). The single arbitrator, or the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall preside over the arbitration. Each arbitrator shall have
sufficient relevant experience to consider the subject matter of the dispute.

hearing shall be held on consecutive Business Days.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;The Parties shall be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with the rules of civil
procedure as in effect where the arbitration occurs, limited to document production and depositions
and subject to further limitation by the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, to secure just
and efficient resolution of the controversy, dispute or claim. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as
applicable, are empowered to issue subpoenas to compel compliance with requirements for pre-hearing
exchange of witness lists and documents or deposition discovery, and to enforce the discovery
rights and obligations of the Parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;The arbitration shall include the presentation of evidence and examination of witnesses at
an oral hearing. The hearing shall be conducted to preserve its privacy and to allow reasonable
procedural due process. Rules of evidence need not be strictly followed, and the hearing shall be
streamlined. Documents shall be self-authenticating, subject to valid objection by the opposing
Party. Expert reports, witness biographies, depositions, and affidavits may be utilized, subject
to the opposing Party&#146;s right to a live cross-examination of the witness in person. The arbitrator
or arbitrators, as applicable, shall control the scheduling and conduct of the proceedings.

rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, shall be final, shall not constitute a
basis for collateral estoppel as to any issue in any other legal or arbitration

of the dispute or as required by applicable Law. The arbitration shall be attended only by counsel
and by those Persons whose presence, in the opinion of any Party or the arbitrator or arbitrators,
is reasonably necessary for the resolution of the dispute. All matters relating to, all evidence
presented at and all submissions made in the course of an arbitration, and all documents produced
in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;10.17</U> or created in the course of or for the purposes of an
arbitration, as well as any arbitral award, shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed
to any Person without the prior written consent of the other Party except as is necessary for the
resolution of the dispute, as required to enforce the arbitral award, or as required by applicable
Law or by an order of the arbitrator or arbitrators made pursuant to a motion or application on
notice to all Parties.
