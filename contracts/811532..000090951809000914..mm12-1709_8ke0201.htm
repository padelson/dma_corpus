Directors_ ") has unanimously approved this Agreement, the Merger (as defined
below), the Conversion (as defined below) and the transactions contemplated
hereby, in accordance with Section 17-211 of the Delaware Revised Uniform

WHEREAS, the sole member of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement, the

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby;

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and

set out therein; and

  

WHEREAS, certain terms are used in this Agreement as defined subsequently in
this Agreement (including _Section 8.11_ ).

  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

       



  



  

ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DRULPA and the
DLLCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") and  the Company shall be the surviving entity in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and shall continue its existence as a
limited partnership under the DRULPA (or in the event of the consummation of
the Conversion as contemplated by _Section 5.14(g)_ , as a limited liability
company under the DLLCA). In connection with the Merger, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall  cease.

  

Section 1.02 _Consummation of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, as
promptly as practicable but in no event  later than the fifth (5th) Business
Day after the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such
waiver) of the conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions) set forth in _Article VI_ , at a location to be agreed by
the parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (excluding the condition in _Section 6.02(e)_ and the conditions
that cannot by their nature be satisfied until the Closing but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the  Closing), the Closing shall
occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a date during the Marketing Period
specified by Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days' notice to the
Company and (b) the first (1st) Business Day immediately following the final
day of the Marketing Period (as it may be extended pursuant to _Section 5.11_
) (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in  _Article VI_ for the Closing as of the date determined pursuant
to this proviso), or such other date, time, or place as agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto. The date of the Closing is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_." Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, on the Closing
Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
duly filing  with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Secretary_ ") an executed certificate of merger (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") in accordance with the DRULPA and/or the DLLCA, as applicable,
and shall take all such reasonable further actions as may be required by Law
to make the Merger effective. The time the Merger becomes effective in 
accordance with applicable Law is referred to as the " _Effective Time_." For
the avoidance of doubt, a condition may only be waived by the parties entitled
to such condition under this Agreement. At Parent's election, in the event the
Change of Control Waiver is not obtained, the Closing shall occur on the same
day that the Requisite Unitholder Vote is obtained (subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions  set forth in _Article VI_ ).

  

Section 1.03 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the DRULPA and/or the DLLCA, as applicable.

  



  

2

       



  



  

Section 1.04 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, the
Limited Partnership Agreement shall be amended and restated as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion, subject to its obligations in _Section 5.06_
herein.

  

Section 1.05 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers
of the Company shall be the officers of the Surviving Entity, and such
officers shall serve until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed, or until their death, resignation or removal from office in
accordance with the Surviving  Entity's limited partnership agreement.

  

Section 1.06 _Conversion of LP Units; Cancellation of General Partner
Interest_. Each unit of limited partnership interest in the Company including
limited partnership interests underlying depositary units (a " _Depositary
Unit_ ") representing limited  partnership interests on deposit with the
Depositary pursuant to the Deposit Agreement (each, as may be converted
immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with _Section 5.14(g)_ , an "
_LP Unit_ " and collectively the " _LP Units_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (v) LP  Units owned by
Parent or Merger Sub, all of which, at the Effective Time, shall be cancelled
without any consideration being exchanged therefor, (w) LP Units owned by the
Company, all of which (other than LP Units in trust accounts, managed
accounts, custodial accounts and the like that are beneficially owned by or
held for the benefit of third parties), at the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled without any consideration being exchanged therefor, (x) LP Units
owned by any direct or  indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
(including Magnum Management Corporation), all of which, immediately following
the Effective Time and as part of an integrated transaction which includes the
Merger, shall be cancelled without any consideration being exchanged therefor,
(y) LP Units as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately
agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which LP Units shall be treated as so
agreed and (z) the Special LP Interests (as  such term is defined in the
Limited Partnership Agreement) all of which, at the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive $5,290,500 in the aggregate, without
interest, with such aggregate amount payable to the holders thereof pro rata
based on the holders' relative capital accounts) shall, by virtue of the
Merger (and, with respect to the LP Units represented by Depositary Units, in
accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement among the General 
Partner, in its capacity both as General Partner and as attorney-in-fact of
holders of Depositary Units, the Company and the Depositary (as it may be
amended, the " _Deposit Agreement_ ")) and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive in cash an amount per LP Unit (subject to any applicable withholding
Tax specified in _Section  1.08_ ) equal to $11.50, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the certificate representing
such LP Units or the depositary receipt evidencing ownership of a Depositary
Unit (the " _Depositary Receipt_ "), as applicable, as provided in _Section
2.02_. At the  Effective Time all such LP Units and Depositary Units shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of such LP Units and/or Depositary Units shall cease to
have any rights with respect

thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein. All of the GP Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, at the option of Parent, either (A) be cancelled
without any consideration in respect thereof or (B) be transferred by the
General Partner to an entity  selected by Parent at its sole discretion with
such entity being admitted as a successor general partner of the Company;
_provided_ , that Parent shall notify the Company of its election in writing
at least ten (10) days prior to the expected Effective Time. For the avoidance
of doubt, the owner of any Depositary Unit shall be deemed to own the
underlying LP Units in lieu of the Depositary.

  

Section 1.07 _Conversion of Membership Interest of Merger Sub_. All of the
limited liability company interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
become one (1)  limited partnership unit in the Surviving Entity or, if the
Conversion occurs, each such limited liability company interest shall be
converted into and become a limited liability company interest in the
Surviving Entity.

  

Section 1.08 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Entity and/or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
or from amounts otherwise payable to a holder of LP Units, Options or Phantom
Units pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as are required to be withheld as
to any  holder subject to withholding under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the LP Units,
Options or Phantom Units in respect of which such  deduction and withholding
was made.

  

ARTICLE II

  

NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS; PAYMENT FOR LP UNITS; TREATMENT OF EQUITY-BASED AWARDS

  

Section 2.01 _No Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

       



     |  

Section 2.02

     |  

_Payment for LP Units_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments due pursuant  to
_Section 1.06_ to holders of LP Units that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for

  



  

4

       



  



  

any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to _Section 1.06_ ,
except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement.

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record
holder of an outstanding Depositary Receipt or certificate or certificates
(collectively, the  " _Certificates_ ") as of the Effective Time which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding LP Units whose
LP Units were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.06_ , a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass,  only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and receiving payment therefor. Following surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate
shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax as specified in  _Section 1.08_ ) equal to the
product of the number of LP Units represented by such Certificate multiplied
by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that  the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Entity that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the
Effective Time and until properly surrendered in accordance with  the
provisions of this _Section 2.02_ , each Certificate shall represent for all
purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of LP Units evidenced by
such Certificate, without any interest thereon.

  

(c) In the case of those LP Units held by American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company (the " _Depositary_ ") on behalf of the holders of Depositary
Units, such LP Units and the related Depositary Units shall be canceled upon
the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time, each  Depositary
Receipt shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration as described in
_Section 2.02_. For the avoidance of doubt, the owner of any Depositary Unit
shall be deemed to own the underlying LP Units in lieu of the Depositary.

  

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Surviving Entity, the posting by such

  



  

5

       



  



  

Person of a bond in such customary and reasonable amount as Parent or the
Surviving Entity may specify as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration with respect to the LP Units formerly represented thereby.

  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former holders of LP Units
as of twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Entity upon demand. Any former holders of LP Units who have not
complied with this  _Section_ _2.02_ prior to the end of such twelve (12)
month period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of LP
Units for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned  property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to the end of
the applicable escheat period (or such earlier date as shall be immediately
prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), any such unclaimed
funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free  and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund
as reasonably directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in short-term obligations
of the United States of America with maturities of no more than  thirty (30)
days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in a fund that invests solely
in the foregoing and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of LP Units that properly converted into the right
to  receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.06_. After
payment of the Merger Consideration, any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to the Surviving Entity or Parent, as Parent
directs.

  

Section 2.03 _Closing of the Company 's Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time: the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of LP
Units shall thereafter be made, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary
to cancel all Depositary Receipts and to cease all transfers with respect to 
the Depositary Units. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Entity for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_.

Section 2.04

     |  

_Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

    
---|---|---

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option (collectively, the "
_Options_ ")to purchase Depositary Units granted under the Seahorse Amended
and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, the Seahorse Amended and Restated
Senior Management Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and the  Seahorse
2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ ")
(other than those Options as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter
separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Options shall be
treated as so agreed),whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be
cancelled and of no further force and effect and the holder of any such Option
shall be entitled to receive, from  and after the Effective Time, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Depositary Units such holder
could have purchased under the Option (assuming the Option was fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time) had such holder exercised such Option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per unit of such Option
and shall be net of any applicable withholding Tax specified  in _Section
1.08_. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price provided for in any
Option exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith to establish a procedure to effect the surrender of
Options contemplated by this _Section 2.04(a)_.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each phantom LP Unit or performance-based
equity award denominated in a number of Depositary Units and outstanding under
the Company Equity Plans or otherwise (each, a " _Phantom Unit_ ") (other than
those Phantom Units as to which the treatment in the Merger  is hereafter
separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Phantom Unit shall
be treated as so agreed), whether or not then vested, shall be cancelled and
the holder of each such Phantom Unit shall be entitled to receive, from and
after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Depositary Units to which such Phantom Unit
relates (it being understood that for Phantom Units attributable to a
performance period that  has not ended as of the Effective Time (without
regard to the transactions contemplated hereby) for which the number of

certifications and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")  including
all audited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries on
Form 10-K and unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and its
subsidiaries on Form 10-Q, all of which have complied, as to form, as of their
respective filing dates (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment
prior to the  date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or
amendment and in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively), in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and, in each case,
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. None of such
Company SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules included
or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed or furnished,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Report. The
Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
written correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other  hand. As of the date of this

the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of
the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent basis for
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the assets, liabilities
and the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of their respective dates, and the consolidated results of  operations and
cash flows for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements,

to normal and recurring year-end adjustments and other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto).

in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company by others within those entities and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors
(A)  any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or

13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal controls over  financial reporting. Since December 31,
2006, any material change in internal control over financial reporting or
failure or inadequacy of disclosure controls required to be disclosed in any
Company SEC Report has been so disclosed.

knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of the Seahorse Parties or any of their Subsidiaries has (a)
failed to comply with the Company's Insider  Trading Policy or Code of
Ethics, as applicable or (b) received any material written complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, or any oral complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim on a hotline or whistleblower or similar telephone line or service
regarding deficiencies in the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,

Company's Subsidiaries will have any liability related to the General Partner

under indemnity or contribution arrangements), whether due or to become due,
and whether or not required to be  recorded or reflected on a balance sheet
under GAAP other than any such liabilities that are, individually or in the
aggregate, _de minimis_ in amount.

  

(g) Except as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, all Derivative Transactions entered into for the account of
any of the Seahorse Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, were entered into in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in
accordance with applicable laws, rules,  regulations and policies of any

The Seahorse Parties and their Subsidiaries have duly performed  their
obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder and neither the Seahorse Parties nor any of their
Subsidiaries have received any notice, whether written or oral, of any
breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any

true and complete list of all Derivative Transactions entered into since
December 31, 2006 for the account of, or that are an asset or liability of,
any of the Seahorse Parties or any of their Subsidiaries. Each such Derivative

purposes under this Agreement immediately at such time as such Acquisition
Proposal made by such party is withdrawn, terminated, expires or at any time
fails to satisfy the requirements of _Sections  5.02(c)(i)_ and _(iii)_. No
party shall be an Excluded Party unless the Board of Directors determines that
such party is an Excluded Party no later than the Solicitation Period End-

Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company and the General Partner

43

       



  



  

to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without first entering
or having entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
Person and (y) will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person which was not
previously made  available to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to
obtaining the Requisite Unitholder Vote, the Company shall in any event be
permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above with
respect to any Excluded Party for so long as such party remains an Excluded

Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
written or oral indication by any Person that it is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the

any receipt of an amendment or proposed amendment to any Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) of
the identity of such Person and provide a copy of such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available, a detailed written
description of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request), including any
material  modifications thereto or to any proposal made by an Excluded Party.
Following the Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any
event no later than within twenty-four (24) hours) of the occurrence of any
material developments, discussions or negotiations or of any material
modifications or proposed material modifications to any Acquisition Proposal,
indication, inquiry or request (including the  terms and conditions thereof
and of any material modifications thereto), and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of
any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in
writing if it determines to provide information or to engage in discussions
or  negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section
5.02(c)_. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as

made available to any other Person

  



  

44

       



  



  

pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission or request under, any standstill
or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to  enforce the provisions of any such agreement. The
Company has not entered into any agreement prior to the date hereof, and will
not enter into any agreement following the date hereof, that would prevent the
Company from providing any information to Parent.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.02(b)(ii)_ to the contrary,
if (i) an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence (an "
_Intervening Event_ ") that affects the business assets or operations of the
Company that is  unknown to the Board of Directors as of the date of this
Agreement becomes known to the Board of Directors prior to obtaining the
Requisite Unitholder Vote or (ii) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal
which the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior
Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement which may be offered by Parent, the Board  of Directors may at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Unitholder Vote, if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that not taking
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors to the Unitholders under applicable Law (x) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (a  "
_Change of Board Recommendation_ "), and (y) only in the case of the foregoing
clause (ii), approve or recommend such Superior Proposal, and/or (z) only in
the case of the foregoing clause (ii), terminate this Agreement to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal to the extent
set forth in _Section 7.01(i)_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless at or concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Breakup Fee in full and otherwise complies with the
provisions of _Section  7.03(b)(iii)_ ; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Board of Directors may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause
(x), approve or recommend any Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z)
unless (A), in  the case of clauses (y) and (z), such Superior Proposal did
not result from a breach by the Company of this _Section 5.02_ and (B) in the
case of clauses (x), (y) and (z):

  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent of
its intention to take any action contemplated in _Section 5.02(e)_ at least
four (4) calendar days (or at least two (2) Business Days, whichever is
longer) in advance of taking such action (the  " _Notice Period_ "), which
notice shall specify, as applicable, the details of such Intervening Event or
the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party

  



  

45

       



  



  

making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of all of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party
making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the
then-current form of the definitive agreements with respect to such Superior
Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition  Agreement_ "); and

  

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, or, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, approving or recommending such Superior Proposal
or terminating this Agreement to enter into a proposed definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal  advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to such
new written notice. The Company agrees that any violation of this _Section
5.02_   by the General Partner or any Subsidiary or Representative of the
General Partner or the Company shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.02_
by the Company.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Board
of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Unitholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act (other than any disclosure of confidential information to third parties 
prohibited by _Section 5.02(d)_ ) ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any
disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express
rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation
of its recommendation to its  Unitholders in favor of the Merger and the
Conversion shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation (including
for purposes of _Section 7.01(g)(i)_ ).

  

(g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and, at the request of Parent, their respective
Affiliates) from any Takeover Laws of any jurisdiction that may purport to be
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise cause any restrictions therein not to  apply.

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any inquiry, offer or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is
structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of
at least 15% of the consolidated assets of, equity  interest in, or
businesses of, the Company, the General Partner or the Company's Subsidiaries
pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, sale of partnership or membership units, sale of
assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any

  



  

46

       



  



  

single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, in each
case other than the Merger, and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (except the references therein to "15%"
shall be replaced by "50%") made in writing that includes per LP Unit merger
consideration  that is greater than the Merger Consideration (including, in
the case of non-cash consideration, a determination by the Board of Directors,
in consultation with its financial advisors, that the per LP Unit merger
consideration is greater than the Merger Consideration) and is on terms that
the Board of Directors has determined in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with the Company's and the General Partner's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor and after  taking into account all legal,
financial (including the financing terms of such proposal), regulatory, timing
and other aspects of the proposal as well as any modifications to this
Agreement Parent and Merger Sub propose to make) are more favorable to the
Unitholders from a financial point of view than this Agreement and which after
taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms of
such proposal), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal (as
well  as any modifications to this Agreement that Parent and Merger Sub
propose to make), is reasonably likely to be consummated.

activities and make such requests in each case in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if providing such access or information would
violate applicable Law or a  contract or obligation of confidentiality owing
to a third-party, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take those actions reasonably necessary so that the Company is able to provide

Section 5.06

     |  

_Indemnification and Insurance_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director, officer or employee of the General Partner, the Company
or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an  " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee was a director, officer or employee of such General
Partner, Company or Subsidiary of the Company or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer or employee of
the General Partner, Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
General Partner, the Company or such Subsidiary (including in  connection
with serving at the request of the General Partner, the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A)
or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated in the Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable  Law. Parent and Merger Sub agree to assume all obligations of
the General Partner, Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement existing in favor of the
Indemnitees as provided in the Limited Partnership Agreement, or the articles
of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, or in any indemnification agreement or arrangement, in
each case, as in effect as of the date of this  Agreement with respect to
matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time after the consummation of
the Merger and such obligations shall continue in full force and effect from
and after the Closing.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective
Time, shall cause the Limited Partnership Agreement (or, in the event that the
Surviving Entity changes its legal form pursuant to _Section 5.14(g)_ or
otherwise, the relevant governing documents of the Surviving Entity) of  the
Surviving Entity to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees
with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors, officers and employees
and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Limited Partnership Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect in any material
respect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after
the 

  



  

51

       



  



  

Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Entity to, pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of
any Indemnitee under this _Section 5.06_ (including in connection with
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this _Section 
5.06(b)_ ) as incurred to the fullest extent set out in the Limited
Partnership Agreement as of the date hereof, _provided_ that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to
the extent required by applicable Law.

  

(c) The Company shall purchase on or prior to the Effective Time, and
the Surviving Entity shall maintain with reputable and financially sound
carriers, tail policies to the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciaries liability insurance policies, in each case,
maintained on the date of this Agreement by the  Company and its
Subsidiaries, which tail policies and fiduciaries liability policies (i) shall
be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the
date six (6) years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time and
(ii) shall contain coverage that is at least as protective to the Persons
covered by such existing policies (a complete and accurate copy of which has
been  made available to Parent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
coverage described above cannot be obtained or can only be obtained by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual amount currently
paid by the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Entity shall only be
required to provide as much coverage as can be obtained by paying aggregate
premiums equal to 300% of the aggregate amount currently paid by the Company
for such coverage.

  

(d) This _Section 5.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
continue in full force and effect and is intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by each Indemnitee (notwithstanding that such Persons are not
parties to this Agreement) and their respective heirs and legal 
representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  

(e) In the event that the Surviving Entity, Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and  in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity or Parent or the properties and assets thereof, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.06_. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this _Section 5.06_ shall
not be terminated or modified following the Effective Time in  such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section
5.06_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification.

Section 5.07

     |  

_Employee Matters_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of its
Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for those individuals employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on a full-time permanent basis at the
Effective Time other than those individuals covered by a  Collective
Bargaining Agreement (as to which the Surviving Entity shall comply with such
Collective Bargaining Agreements, subject to the right to amend or terminate
these agreements in accordance with their terms) (the " _Current Employees_ ")
compensation, severance and benefits provided under Company Plans which
benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
maintained for and provided to Current  Employees as a group immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding, for this purpose, defined benefit
pension benefits, retiree medical and equity-based compensation).

  

(b) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to cause service rendered by
Current Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time to be taken into account for vesting, eligibility and benefits accrual
purposes under any employee benefit plans of the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries which are made available to any  Current Employee, to the same
extent as such service was or is taken into account under the corresponding
Company Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that such recognition shall not result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service and
shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or for purposes of any newly implemented  employee benefit plans
for which service is not taken into account or with respect to employee
benefit plans for which participant, service and/or benefit accrual is frozen.
Current Employees shall not be subject to any pre-existing condition
limitation under any health plan of Parent, the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior
to the Effective  Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Current
Employees credit under such plans for co-payments made and deductibles
satisfied prior to the Effective Time with respect to the year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

  

(c) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to its distribution, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with a copy
of any communication intended to be made to any of their respective employees
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide a
reasonable opportunity for Parent and Merger Sub to  review and suggest
revisions to such communications.

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall affect the
right of Parent (or, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment of its employees. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed to grant any employee of any Company a right
to continued

  



  

53

       



  



  

employment by, or to receive any payment or benefits from, any Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or through any Employee Benefit Plan
or other benefit plan. This Agreement shall not limit Parent's or its
Affiliates' ability or right to amend or terminate any benefit or compensation
plan or program of Parent or its Affiliates and nothing contained herein shall
be construed as  an amendment to or modification of any such plan. Nothing
contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall constitute an amendment
to any Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, create any third party
beneficiary rights or inure to the benefit of or be enforceable by any
employee of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or of any
entity or any Person representing the interest of any employees.

  

Section 5.08 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall take all steps to exclude
the applicability of, or to assist in any challenge to the validity or
applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

  

Section 5.09 _Proxy Statement; Other Filings_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) after the
date of this Agreement, (a) the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC,
subject to the prior review, comment and approval of Parent (which approval
shall not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Proxy Statement and (b)
each of the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, prepare and file with the SEC all Other Filings as required by
the Exchange Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall obtain and furnish the
information concerning itself and its Affiliates required to be included in
the Proxy Statement and, to the extent applicable, the Other Filings. Parent
shall promptly provide such other information  or assistance in the
preparation thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Company. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, and the Company shall
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Unitholders promptly after
clearing comments received from the SEC (it being understood that it is
intended that the  Proxy Statement be mailed as soon as possible and without
regard to other time periods under this Agreement); _provided_ , that if the
Change of Control Waiver has not been obtained at the time that the comments
from the SEC have been cleared, then the Proxy Statement shall be mailed on
the first date following the time at which the conditions set forth in
_Section 5.11(c)(A) and (B)(2)(x)_   shall have been satisfied but in any
event not before February 1, 2010. Each party shall promptly notify the other
party upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Other Filings and shall provide the other party with copies
of all correspondence between it, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff,
on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or  the Other Filings. If
at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers should be discovered by the Company or Parent, which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Other
Filings so that the Proxy

  



  

54

       



  



  

Statement or the Other Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement  describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the Unitholders, in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or filing the Other Filings (or, in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or
its staff with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or  mailing
such document shall provide the other party an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall include in such document or
response appropriate and reasonable comments timely proposed by the other
party.

  

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of the occurrence or non-occurrence, to their respective knowledge, of any
event, which is likely (a) to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained  in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate if made as of
the Effective Time so that the Closing condition in _Section 6.02(a)_ or
_6.03(a)_ , as applicable, would not be satisfied, (b) to result in any
material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder or (c) to
result in the failure of any condition  to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of
the parties receiving such notice.

Surviving Entity and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practical, furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing sources with
financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as

the Securities Act for a registered public offering, and of type and form
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A, to consummate the
offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by  the Debt Financing
Commitments **,** assuming that such offering(s) were consummated at the same
time during the Company's fiscal year as such offering(s) of debt securities
will be made, or as otherwise reasonably required in connection with the Debt
Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise
necessary in order to assist in receiving customary "comfort" (including
"negative  assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection
with the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments (all such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required
Information_ "); (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary
accountants' comfort letters, appraisals, surveys, engineering reports,
environmental and other inspections (including providing  reasonable access
to Parent and its agents to all Owned Real Property for such purposes;
_provided_ , that such access does not include the right to conduct any
invasive soil or groundwater sampling without the Company's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), title insurance and other documentation and items relating to the
Debt Financing and the Amendment as reasonably  requested by Parent and, if

necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing

purposes of establishing collateral arrangements as of the Effective Time and
(B) assist Parent to establish or maintain, effective as of the Effective
Time, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the Debt Financing and the Amendment; (viii)
using reasonable best  efforts to assist Parent to obtain waivers, consents,
estoppels and approvals from other parties to material leases, encumbrances

Subsidiaries (not needed for other purposes), to be made available to the
Company on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , that none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
officers, advisors or representatives shall incur any liability in connection
with the Financing prior to the Effective Time; (x) executing the Amendment
upon the  written request of Parent, on or prior to the Effective Time (it

requisite lenders thereunder (the " _Change of Control Waiver_ "), will become
effective prior to the Effective Time) and (xi) using  commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Parent and Merger Sub to (1) deliver to the

marketing material to be used in connection with the syndication of the
Amendment and (2) obtain a corporate family rating and ratings for the amended
credit facilities from each of SandP and Moody's by January 11, 2010. The
Company will take  reasonable best efforts to periodically update any such
Required Information provided to Parent pursuant to clause (iii) of the
foregoing sentence as may be necessary such that such Required Information
does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access
the financing markets, require the cooperation of  the Company under this
_Section 5.11(a)_ at any time, and from time to time and on multiple
occasions, between the date hereof and the Effective Time. In addition, the
Company agrees that it will continuously supplement and keep current the
Required Information and provide any supplements to Parent so that Parent may
most effectively access the financing markets. The Company shall timely file
Company SEC Reports with the SEC in  accordance with Law. If the Effective
Time does not occur, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, advisors and Representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless
by Parent for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing (other than to the
extent such losses arise from the misconduct of the Company, any of its 
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, advisors and representatives) and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the
Debt Financing and the Amendment; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably  likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective officers,

  



  

57

       



  



  

advisors or representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
not be required in connection with the Amendment to make any payment to the
lenders, arrangers or any other persons under the Credit Agreement prior to
the Effective Time.

  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
complete the Equity Financing as part of the Closing and arrange the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitments in a timely manner (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period)  ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (i) amend
the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement (each on a non-exclusive basis
until the Solicitation Period End-Date), or (ii) otherwise replace or amend
the Debt Financing Commitments so long as such action would not reasonably
be  expected to delay or prevent the Closing and the terms are not materially
less beneficial to Parent or Merger Sub, with respect to conditionality, than
those in the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the date of this
Agreement), including (1) using reasonable best efforts to (x) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein (including the flex provisions) or on other terms no less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub,  (y) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements
that are within its control and (z) upon the satisfaction of such conditions,
to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the funding of the Debt Financing
and (2) using reasonable best efforts to seek to enforce its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments. In the event that all conditions to the Financing
Commitments (other than, with respect to the Debt  Financing, the
availability of Equity Financing) and all the conditions in _Sections 6.01_
and _6.02_ have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the lenders and other Persons to fund the Debt Financing and Equity
Financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date (including
using reasonable best efforts in taking enforcement action to cause  such
lenders and other Persons to provide such financing). If any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Debt Financing Commitments or the Debt Financing Commitments shall be
terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent or Merger Sub
for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms no less
favorable to Parent or Merger  Sub as those contained in the Debt Financing
Commitments and in an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount ("
_Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain and, if obtained, will provide the
Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for at least
the same amount of financing as provided under the Debt Financing Commitments
originally issued, to the extent needed to fund the Required Amount, and on
terms  and conditions (including economic terms, termination rights, flex
provisions and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub
than those included in the Debt Financing Commitments (the " _New Debt
Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and things

  



  

58

       



  



  

necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the
Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New Debt
Commitment Letter in a timely manner (taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained therein or on  other terms no less favorable to Parent
and Merger Sub, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within their
respective control and (iii) upon the satisfaction of such conditions, use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the funding of such Alternate
Financing. Parent shall keep the Company apprised of material developments
relating to the Financing, and shall give the Company prompt notice  of any
material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days, if at any time (i) any of the Financing
Commitments shall expire or be terminated for any reason, or (ii) any
financing source that is a party to any of the Financing Commitments notifies
Parent or Merger Sub that such source no longer intends to provide financing
on the terms set forth  therein. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any
of its affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take
any action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition or
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that
could reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the
consummation of the Financing contemplated by any of the Financing
Commitments. For purposes of this Agreement,  " _Marketing Period_ " shall
mean the first period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days after the
Expected Date (1) throughout and at the end of which Parent shall have (and
its financing sources shall have access to) the Required Information (it being
understood that if at any time during the Marketing Period the Required
Information becomes stale, ceases to comport with the SEC requirements for a
registered public  offering of debt securities or otherwise does not include
the "Required Information," as defined, then the Marketing Period shall not
have occurred), (2) throughout and at the end of which the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing and other than the
conditions in  _Section 6.02(e)_ and _Section 6.02(f)_ and, in the event that
the Change of Control Waiver has not been obtained, other than the condition
in _Section 6.01(a)_ ) shall be satisfied and nothing has occurred and no
condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.01_   and _Section 6.02_ to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were
to be scheduled for any time during such thirty (30) consecutive calendar day
period and (3) in no event shall the Marketing Period include any day prior to
January 9, 2010; _provided_ , that the Marketing Period shall end on any
earlier date that is the date on which the Debt Financing is consummated; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the condition set forth in _Section
6.01(a)_ is not satisfied by the end of the Marketing Period, the Marketing
Period shall automatically be extended until the first to occur of (i) the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 6.01(a)_   and (ii) the
Outside Date.

  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Expected Date_ " shall mean
the latest to occur of (A) the date Parent and its financing sources have
received from the

  



  

59

       



  



  

Company the Required Information with respect to the Marketing Period and (B)
(1) in the event the Change of Control Waiver has been obtained on or prior to
January 31, 2010, the first Business Day following the date on which the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have been
satisfied  (other than conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied
at the Closing and other than the conditions in _Section 6.02(e)_ and _Section
6.02(f)_ ) and (2) in the event the Change of Control Waiver has not been
obtained on or prior to January 31, 2010, the later to occur of (x) the first
Business Day following the date on which the conditions set forth in 
_Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have been satisfied (other than conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing and other than the
conditions in _Section 6.01(a)_ , _Section 6.02(e)_ and _Section 6.02(f)_ )
and (y) the  date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Unitholders.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub may enter discussions regarding, and may enter into
arrangements and agreements relating to the financing to add other equity
providers, so long as in respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the
following conditions are met: (i) the aggregate amount of  the Equity
Financing is not reduced, (ii) the arrangements and agreements, in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing and
(iii) the arrangements and agreements would not diminish or release the pre-
Closing obligations of the parties to the Equity Financing Commitment,
adversely affect the rights of Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Equity Financing Commitment or otherwise constitute a waiver or
reduction of Parent\'s  rights under the Equity Financing Commitment.

  

(e) The Seahorse Parties shall take all actions so as not to allow any
payment default to occur under the Credit Agreement.

  

(f) The Seahorse Parties shall not terminate any commitment under the
Credit Agreement.

  

(g) The Company shall deliver to Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the earlier of (A) the date the
Company files with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2009 and (B) March 1, 2010), (i) a calculation of EBITDA
(as defined in _Exhibit  A_ hereto) for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the four (4) fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2009 (the " _Calculation_ ")
and (ii) a certificate signed on behalf of each of the General Partner and the
Company by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer thereof
certifying the Calculation (the " _EBITDA  Certificate_ "). Without prejudice
to _Section 5.03_ , the Company shall, concurrently with and following the
provision of the EBITDA Certificate, provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives with all financial and operating data and other information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and reasonable access to all available
information, employees, books, contracts, commitments and records to  enable
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives to evaluate the
accuracy of the Calculation for not less

  



  

60

       



  



  

than thirty (30) calendar days (or a shorter period if Parent advises the
Company sooner that it has completed its review of the Calculation) or longer
in the event that reasonable access is not provided to Parent, Merger Sub and
their Representatives (the " _EBITDA Review Period ")_.

  

(h) The Seahorse Parties agree that they will not amend, modify,
terminate or take any action with respect to the ISDA Master Agreement
Amendments, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Company, Canada's
Wonderland Company and Keybank National association and the related swap
documents (the " _Swap  Amendment Agreement_ "), without the written consent
of Parent. In addition, the Seahorse Parties shall take such actions in
respect of the Swap Amendment Agreement as are requested by Parent provided
that such actions are effective contemporaneous with the Merger.

  

Section 5.12 _Subsequent Filings_. Until the Effective Time, the Company
will timely file with the SEC each form, report and document required to be
filed by the Company under the Exchange Act and will promptly make available
to Parent (and provide Parent with drafts prior to filing) copies of each such
report  filed with the SEC. As of their respective dates, none of such
reports shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of the Company included in such reports shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied  on a consistent basis (except to
the extent indicated in the notes thereto) and shall fairly present, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of their operations and
changes in financial position for the periods then ended.

  

Section 5.13 _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or  delayed), except to the extent such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall provide each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and the

of all of the LP Units and GP Units in accordance with Internal Revenue 
Service Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2); _provided_ , that
immediately following the cancellation of any LP Units owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company pursuant to

  



  

61

       



  



  

_Section 1.06(x)_ immediately following the Effective Time, all of the LP

one or more entities treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes.

  

(b) The Company and the General Partner shall provide to Parent for its
review and comment copies of income and franchise Tax Returns of the Company,

Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-2(c) and (d) or take or cause to be taken
(or fail to take or cause to be taken) any other action that could reasonably
be expected to cause the Company to fail to qualify as an "electing 1987
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(g)(2) of the Code.

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each of the Company, Boeckling, KBF and,
unless the Dissolution is consummated as contemplated by _Section 5.14(g)_ ,

(e) Any liability arising out of any transfer Tax with respect to any
property owned directly or indirectly by the Seahorse Parties or any of their
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due in
connection with or by reason of the consummation of the Merger or Conversion,
shall be borne by the Surviving Entity or Parent  and expressly shall not be
a liability of the former holders of partnership (or limited liability
company) interests in the Company.

  

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, officers,
employees, agents and representatives to cooperate with Parent, its
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents and representatives with respect to

(g) At Parent's request, each of the Seahorse Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause Seahorse Ohio to be liquidated
and dissolved prior to the Closing (the " _Dissolution_ ") (which commercially
reasonable efforts, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not  include (1) filing
a statement of dissolution for Seahorse Ohio under Ohio Law if Ohio Law
provides another means of effectively liquidating and dissolving Seahorse Ohio
prior to the Closing or (2) otherwise taking any irreversible action of
significance prior to the Closing) and/or (ii) cause the Company to be
converted into a limited liability company under the laws of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DRULPA and DLLCA effective immediately prior
to the Closing having  such

  



  

62

       



  



  

limited liability company agreement and other organizational documents as
determined by Parent and, at the request of the Company, containing language
to the effect set forth in _Schedule 5.14(g)(ii)_ (and the General Partner
hereby agrees to such inclusion, if applicable) (the " _Conversion_ ") 
unless (in the case of clause (ii)), the Company receives written advice (and
provides a copy to Parent) of a nationally recognized law or accounting firm
(which advice and firm are reasonably acceptable to Parent) that the
consummation of the Conversion would result in a significant adverse effect as
a result of any change in law or in any administrative interpretation thereof
occurring after the date hereof to the holders of partnership or other equity
interests in the Company;  _provided_ , that (w) such efforts shall not
require the consummation of either the Dissolution or the Conversion prior to
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the parties'
obligations to effect the Merger, (x) the consummation of either the
Dissolution or the Conversion shall not be a condition to, or result in any
delay in the consummation of, the Closing and (y) the consummation of the
Dissolution shall not  adversely affect (other than in any immaterial
respects), the holders of partnership or other equity interests in the
Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to
incur out of pocket expenses in excess of $2,000,000 to effect the Dissolution
unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company for such excess.

  

(h) The Surviving Entity shall in good faith (i) allocate the Merger
Consideration and the amount of any liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that would be included in "amount realized" for U.S. federal,
state and local income Tax purposes to the assets of the Company and its
relevant Subsidiaries in a manner consistent  with (x) applicable Law and (y)
the appraised values of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date, as determined pursuant to appraisals performed by a
nationally recognized valuation firm on the basis of reasonable assumptions
and employing reasonable methodology, it being understood that Parent and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the identity of
the such valuation firm and the scope of such appraisals prior to the 
Closing; and (ii) prepare and file all income Tax Returns of the Company for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and prepare and
provide Schedules K-1 (and any state and local equivalents) to the former
holders of partnership (or limited liability company) interests in the
Company, in each case in a manner consistent with past practice and in
accordance with applicable Law. The Surviving Entity shall engage the
nationally recognized accounting firms that have  historically prepared the
income Tax Returns of the Company to prepare the income Tax Returns and
Schedules K-1 described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence (to the
extent they are willing to act on reasonable terms). Following the Effective
Time, no amended Tax Return shall be filed in respect of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date in
a manner that would adversely affect the former holders of partnership or
other  equity interests in the Company except as required by applicable Law,
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or a good faith resolution
of a tax contest.

  



  

63

       



  



  

(i) Following the Closing, the Surviving Entity shall (i) prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the
General Partner for all taxable periods (whether ending on, prior to or after
the Closing Date) and (ii) pay any Taxes owed by the General Partner as shown
due on such Tax Returns or resulting  from any claim, examination, audit or
proceeding with respect to such Tax Returns (but only to the extent the amount
of such Taxes owed by the General Partner does not exceed $100,000).

set forth in _Article VI_ , as the case may be, and which is not cured within
the earlier of (i) the Outside Date and (ii) thirty (30) days following
written notice to the

in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (B) there shall have been a breach
of  any of the covenants or agreements in _Section 5.02_ (whether or not
material) which breach, other than any breach of _Section 5.02(b)_ , if

failed to include in the Proxy Statement distributed to Unitholders the

no condition exists that  would cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ to fail to be satisfied and Parent fails to
complete the Closing within two (2) Business Days following the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.02_ and the Company stood

(b)

Notwithstanding the foregoing:

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(i) If (I) (A) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_ or _Section 7.01(d)_ or (B) Parent terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section  7.01(f)_ or _Section 7.01(k)(i)_ and
(II) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into
an agreement in respect of, or consummates any Acquisition Proposal, then the
Company shall pay to Parent (or as otherwise directed by Parent) the Breakup
Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds, simultaneously with the entry into an
agreement in respect of the Acquisition Proposal, or, if  earlier,
consummation of such an Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be; _provided_
that for purposes of this _Section 7.03_ , the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.02(h)(i)_ , except
that the references to "at least  15%" shall be deemed to be references to
"more than 40%".

  

(ii) If the Company terminates this Agreement (A) pursuant to _Section
7.01(e)_ and at such time the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ and
_6.02_ have been satisfied or (B)  pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_ , and in
each case, the Company has not breached in any respect, or, if breached but
curable, failed to fully cure within seven (7) calendar days of such breach,
in each case, any provision of _Section 5.02_ , _Section 5.04_ , _Section
5.09_ or  _Section 5.11_ , then Parent and Merger Sub, collectively shall pay
the Maximum Recovery Amount to the

  



  

69

       



  



  

Company or as directed by the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination),
payable by wire transfer of same day funds. For the avoidance of doubt, each
of the Seahorse Parties acknowledges and agrees that any breach by any of the
Seahorse Parties of _Section  5.02(b)_ , _Section 5.04_ (with respect to the
date for the Special Meeting) or _Section 5.09_ (with respect to the dates for
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement), is incapable of cure.

  

(iii) If (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(g)_ or (B) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(i)_ , then the Company shall pay to Parent (or as otherwise directed by
Parent) either  simultaneously with (in the case of termination by the
Company in accordance with subclause (B) of this _Section 7.03(b)(iii)_ ) or
within two (2) Business Days after such termination (in the case of such
termination by Parent in accordance with subclause (A) of this _Section
7.03(b)(iii)_ ), the Breakup Fee; _provided_ , that if Parent is  entitled to
the Breakup Fee pursuant to subclause (A) of this _Section 7.03(b)(iii)_ and
the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Company's
Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement)
would be greater than 5.0 after giving pro forma effect to the payment of the
Breakup Fee, then the Company may elect to pay a portion of the Breakup Fee by
issuing LP Units (in the form of  Depositary Units) to Parent, in lieu of
cash, on the sixth (6th) trading day after such termination, subject to and in
the manner, terms and amount set forth in _Section 7.03(g)_ and _Exhibit B_
hereto; _provided_ , that the Company shall pay a portion of the Breakup Fee
in cash to the maximum extent that such portion would not  result in the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeding 5.0.

  

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_ (if at any time after the date of this
Agreement, and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn  or
terminated or otherwise communicated to the Company or the General Partner and
not withdrawn or terminated), _Section 7.01(d)_ or _7.01(f)_ (and at such time
Parent is not in material breach of this Agreement), then the Company shall
pay to Parent (or as otherwise directed by Parent) an amount equal to the sum
of Parent's and Merger Sub's Expenses by wire transfer of same  day funds,
within two (2) Business Days, after such information is provided by Parent to
the Company (it being understood that such provision of information may take
place in installments rather than at one time in which case the Company shall
pay to Parent the amounts specified in installments, in each case, within two
(2) Business days after such information is provided by Parent); _provided_ ,
that if Parent is entitled to the  Expenses pursuant to this _Section
7.03(b)(iv)_ and the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the
Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Credit
Agreement) would be greater than 5.0

  



  

70

       



  



  

after giving pro forma effect to the payment of the Expenses, then the Company
may elect to pay a portion of the Expenses by issuing LP Units (in the form of
Depositary Units) to Parent, in lieu of cash, on the sixth (6th) trading day
after such termination, subject to and in the manner, terms and amount set
forth in _Section 7.03(g)_   and _Exhibit B_ hereto; _provided_ , that the
Company shall pay a portion of the Expenses in cash to the maximum extent that
such portion would not result in the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeding
5.0; _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the Company of such
Expenses  pursuant to this _Section 7.03(b)(iv)_ shall not relieve the
Company of any obligation, if any, to pay the Breakup Fee.

  

(c) " _Breakup Fee_ " means an amount in cash (subject to the provisos
in _Section 7.03(b)(iii)_ ) equal to $19,556,700, which Breakup Fee shall be
paid (when due and owing) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account  designated by the recipient; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, "Breakup Fee" means an amount in cash equal to
$11,408,100 solely in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date pursuant to _Section
7.01(i)_. In each case, prior to being paid to  Parent, the Breakup Fee shall
be reduced by the amount of any Expenses actually paid (if any) to Parent
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(d) " _Maximum Recovery Amount_ " means an amount in cash equal to
$50,000,000, which Maximum Recovery Amount shall be paid (when due and owing)
by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Company.

  

(e) " _Expenses_ " means all actual, documented out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of financing sources (including any amounts
payable in connection with the Debt Financing and the Debt Financing
Commitments), counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and 
consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) actually incurred by a party
or on its behalf in connection with or related to the investigation,
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, up to an aggregate amount equal to $6,500,000.

  

(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company
shall fail to pay the Breakup Fee or Expenses when due or Parent or Merger 
Sub shall fail to pay the Maximum Recovery Amount when due, the Company or
Merger Sub and Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for
all reasonable Expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party
(including reasonable Expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this _Section 7.03_. The parties hereto agree that in
no event shall (i) Parent be required to pay the  Maximum Recovery Amount on
more than one occasion or (ii) the Company be required to pay the Breakup Fee
on more than one occasion.

  



  

71

       



  



  

(g) To the extent that the Company issues Depositary Units to Parent, in
lieu of cash, as expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)(iii)_ or
_Section 7.03(b)(iv)_ , then the amount of the Depositary Units to be issued
to Parent shall equal an  amount of Depositary Units with a cash value equal
to the amount of cash otherwise payable; _provided_ , that such Depositary
Units shall be valued based on a 10% discount to the volume-weighted average
trading price of the Depositary Units for the five (5) trading days (as
reported on the NYSE Transaction Reporting System) beginning the first trading
day immediately following the date of the termination of this Agreement. In
addition,  upon and at all times following any issuance of Depositary Units
to Parent, the Company shall comply with all of the terms set forth in
_Exhibit B_ hereto which is incorporated herein by reference and which shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

Section 7.04 _Maximum Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing for any
or no reason or otherwise breach this Agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or fail to perform hereunder
(whether willfully,  intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then,
except for an order of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 8.04(c)_ , the Company's sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and any of their respective former, current
and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, 
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
financing sources (including the parties to the Debt Financing Commitments),
managers, general or limited partners or assignees (each a " _Related Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Related Parties_ ") or any Related Party of any
Related Party for any breach, loss or damage shall be to  terminate this
Agreement and receive payment of the Maximum Recovery Amount, in each case,
only to the extent provided by _Section 7.03_ or pursuant to the Limited
Guarantee, as applicable; and upon payment of such amount, no Person shall
have any rights or claims against any of the Related Parties or any Related
Party of any Related Party under this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the
Equity Financing Commitment or otherwise,  whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Related Parties or any Related
Party of any Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the
specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in  _Section 8.04(c)_.
If the Company is required to pay the Breakup Fee to Parent pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent's and Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), without prejudice to the
remedy of specific performance set forth in _Section 8.04(b)_ , against the
Company and any Related Party of the Company or any  Related Party of any
Related Party for any breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this
Agreement and receive payment of the Breakup Fee, in each case, only to the
extent provided by _Section 7.03_ ; and upon payment of such amount, no Person
shall have any rights or claims against any of the Related Parties or any
Related Party of any Related Party under this Agreement or otherwise, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in 

  



  

72

       



  



  

tort or otherwise, and none of the Related Parties or any Related Party of any
Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

Section 7.05 _Amendment_. _ _To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any
time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Unitholders but, after
any such Unitholder approval,  no amendment shall be made which decreases the
Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Unitholders
hereunder without the approval of the Unitholders. This Agreement may not be
amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 8.02 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Disclosure Letter, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to  the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
by any party by operation of law or otherwise without

  



  

73

       



  



  

the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that Parent or
Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to any
direct or indirect Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations
hereunder.

  

Section 8.03 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to conflict of law principles thereof that would result
in the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction) except that matters 
relating to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors shall be governed
by the laws of the State of Ohio and matters relating to the fiduciary duties
of the General Partner shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of New York or the United States
District Court, in each case, located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York (the  " _New York Courts_ ") in the event any dispute arises out
of or in any way related to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, including, any claim relating to or arising out of due
diligence conducted in connection with or the negotiation, interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement (a " _Claim_ ") or involving any Related Party
or any  Related Party of a Related Party and hereby waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the
parties hereto irrevocably agree that all Claims brought by or against any of
the parties hereto or any of their  respective Affiliates or any Related
Party or any Related Party of a Related Party with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined solely and exclusively in a New York
Court, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any New York Court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any Claim in any court other than the New York
Courts and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to  any Claim.
The parties hereto agree that any violation of this _Section 8.03_ (including

irreparable harm.

  

       



     |  

Section 8.04

     |  

_Validity; Specific Performance_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law; but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable Law or rule in any  jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

  



  

74

       



  



  

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed by the Company
in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII,  Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including _Section 8.04(b)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of Parent's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and to consummate the 
Merger only in the event that (i) Parent and Merger Sub are required to
complete the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.02_ , (ii) the Debt Financing has
been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in
accordance with _Section 1.02_ and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
that if  specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or
to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not
be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).
Each of the parties agrees that  it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to  enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically
enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent and Merger
Sub pursuant to this  _Section 8.04(c)_ but the standards set forth in this
_Section 8.04(c)_ for the Company's entitlement to specific performance have
been met and would otherwise entitle the Company to seek specific performance,
then, and solely in such event, the Company shall be entitled to, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall pay to the Company (or as directed by the Company), the
Maximum Recovery  Amount as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
two (2) week period in the proviso below (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days of such two (2) week period), payable by wire transfer of same
day funds; _provided_ , that if a court has granted an award of damages or the
Maximum Recovery Amount, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages
only if, within two (2) weeks following such award, the Company shall  offer
and commit to complete the Merger and Parent and Merger Sub have not

  



  

75

       



  



  

consummated the Merger. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal
action or proceeding still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time
as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt and
subject only to the possible entitlement to specific performance as set forth
in _Section 8.04_ , in no event shall Parent,  Merger Sub, the Related
Parties or any Related Party of any Related Party have any liability under or
in respect of this Agreement or the transactions related hereto in excess of
an aggregate amount equal to the Maximum Recovery Amount.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except
as and to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 8.04(c)_ , the parties
acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
any  remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and that the Company's sole and exclusive remedies with respect to
any such breach shall be the remedies set forth in _Section 7.04_.

Blackout Period Day)) and to cause such registration statement to remain
continuously effective until the earlier of such time as (i) the Registrable
Securities are saleable by Parent under Rule  144 without volume restrictions
and the Company delivers an opinion to Parent from outside counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent to such effect and the Registrable Securities represent
1% or less of the outstanding LP Units and (ii) all Registrable Securities
have been sold.

_Demand Registrations_ : If the Company is unable to maintain the

underwritten offering (of not less than 1% of the outstanding LP Units) Parent
shall have the ability to issue 2 demand registrations in any single calendar
year. Upon any demand, the  Company must use reasonable best efforts to cause
a registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
possible (but in any event no later than (a) 20 days after delivery of such
demand or (b) in the event of a review of the registration statement by the
SEC, 50 days after delivery of such demand (and if the registration statement

_True-up / True-down_ : On each of the 90th, 180th and 360th day (and, if all
Registrable Securities are sold on a later date, on such later date or dates
(which may occur on multiple occasions))  following the date of issuance
(each, an "Applicable Date"), Parent shall in good faith determine the value
of (A) the Breakup Fee or Expenses, as the case may be, by applying a growth
rate of 10% per annum to the amount of the Breakup Fee or Expenses, as the
case may be, which shall accrue and be compounded daily from the date the
Merger Agreement was terminated through the Applicable Date (as may be
adjusted on each Applicable Date, the  "Guaranteed Value") and (B) the sum of
(i) the value of the Registrable Securities (if any) held by Parent on the
Applicable Date (based

    
---|---

            | on the closing price of a Depositary Unit on such date as
reported on the NYSE) and (ii) the value, on the Applicable Date, of the cash
proceeds received by Parent in connection with a sale of Registrable
Securities, applying a growth rate of 10% per annum to such cash proceeds,
which shall accrue and be compounded daily from the date the cash proceeds
were received by Parent through the Applicable Date, in each case of (i) and
(ii), after  deducting any and all Taxes and any and all expenses (not paid
by or otherwise reimbursed by the Company) that have been or may be incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates in connection with the
issuance to Parent or its Affiliates of Registrable Securities or any sale of
Registrable Securities (the "Applicable Date Value"). If on any Applicable
Date, the Applicable Date Value is less than the Guaranteed Value, then the
Company shall issue  additional Registrable Securities to Parent, which may
be on more than one occasion, so that the Applicable Date Value (including the
Applicable Date Value of the additional Registrable Securities issued to
Parent) is equal to the Guaranteed Value. If the Company has complied with all
of its obligations set forth in this Exhibit B during the time periods
prescribed and, on a date on which all of the Registrable Securities have
already been sold, the Applicable Date Value is  greater than the Guaranteed
Value, then Parent will reimburse the Company for such excess. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, in the event that the Company enters into an
agreement in respect of, or consummates any Acquisition Proposal (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) within twelve (12) months after the day the
Registrable Securities are first issued to Parent, then the Company shall, at
Parent's request, simultaneously with the entry into an agreement in  respect
of the Acquisition Proposal, or, if earlier, consummation of such an
Acquisition Proposal, repurchase from Parent (or any Affiliate of Parent
holding Registrable Securities) for cash (which shall be delivered by wire
transfer of same day funds) all of the Registrable Securities at a price that
will result in the Applicable Date Value as of such date equaling the
Guaranteed Value.

_Deferral of True-Up_ : If any issuance of Registrable Securities or any
portion of an issuance of Registrable Securities (including the initial
issuance as payment of the Breakup Fee or Expenses, as the case may be) would
result in Parent owning 10% or more of the outstanding LP Units of the
Company, the Company shall defer  all or any portion of any issuance to the
extent that such issuance or portion thereof would result in Parent owning 10%
or more of the outstanding LP Units of the Company. In the event that any
issuance or portion thereof is deferred, the Company shall, on the first
Business Day of the month immediately following such deferral (and, if
applicable, the first Business Day of every subsequent month), issue such
amount of Registrable Securities which have been deferred  to Parent up to an
amount that would result in Parent owning no more than 9.9% of the outstanding
LP Units of the Company. The provisions in this Section 5 shall be binding and

_Blackout Period_ : The Company shall have a right to suspend or delay, at any
time (but not more than once in any twelve-month period) the registration
process and/or suspend Parent's ability to use a prospectus if, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of its Board of Directors, the continuation of
