-v- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of May 28, 2010 by and SAVVIS Inc. ("
_Buyer_ "), a Delaware corporation, Blue Jay Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware
corporation wholly-owned by Buyer (" _Merger Sub_ "), Fusepoint Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Company_ "), and M/C Venture Partners V, L.P., (the "
_Stockholders  Representative_").

RECITALS:

 

A. The Companys Subsidiaries are in the business of owning and operating data
centers and providing managed infrastructure and colocation hosting services,
information technology application services and disaster recovery services,
and consulting services related to the foregoing.

 

B. The Board of Directors of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company have each
determined that it is advisable for, and in the best interest of, their
respective stockholders for Buyer to acquire the Company in a business
combination transaction in which Merger Sub would merge with and into the
Company, such that, after giving effect thereto, the Company is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Buyer.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained and other valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby represent, warrant,
covenant and agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

 

 _DEFINED TERMS_

 

Capitalized terms used herein and in the Disclosure Schedule are used with the
respective meanings ascribed thereto as set forth in  _Appendix A_ hereto.
Terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the
plural, and vice versa, and the reference to any gender includes all genders.
References to "hereof," "herein" or similar terms refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not a particular section, and references to "this Section" or
"this Article" refer to the entire section or article and not a particular
subsection thereof. The word "including" shall not be read restrictively and
shall mean "including without limitation" unless otherwise specified.

 

ARTICLE 2

 

 _THE MERGER; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; CLOSING_

 

2.1 _Merger; Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time and in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation
Law, as amended (the " _Act_ "), Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") and, thereupon, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (hereinafter sometimes called the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") under the Act. 2.2 _Effect of Merger_.

 

(a) The effect of the Merger shall be as provided by the Act. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the
Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Merger Sub and the Company shall become debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to be in the form
attached as Exhibit A, until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with
the provisions thereof and the Act and (ii) the bylaws of the Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, except that the name of the corporation shall be
changed to Fusepoint Inc. and the provisions required by Section 7.7 of this
Agreement shall be included in such bylaws, until thereafter changed or
amended in accordance with the provisions of Surviving Corporations
certificate of incorporation and the Act.

 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; and the officers of
Merger Sub shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified, as the case may be.

2.3 _Effective Time; Further Actions_. Prior to the Closing, the Company, the
Buyer and Merger Sub shall prepare, and on the Closing Date shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by the filing of, a certificate of merger, consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
parties (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with, the Act, and each of the Company, the Buyer and Merger Sub shall make
all other recordings or filings required under the Act or any other
applicable Law as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Stockholders
Representative and Buyer and as shall be set forth in such certificate) in
accordance with the Act, which Certificate of Merger shall be so filed at the
time of the Closing. The date and time when the Merger becomes effective are
referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

 

2.4 _Status and Conversion of Securities_. The manner of converting or
canceling the Capital Securities of the Company and Merger Sub in the Merger
shall be as set forth below in this Section 2.4.

(a) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, and without any further action on the part of the
Stockholders, the Company, the Buyer or Merger Sub being necessary, each share
of the Company Stock shall convert into and become the right to receive cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to the portion of the Base Purchase Price
(as adjusted pursuant to, and subject to all of the terms, provisions,
limitation and procedures of, this Agreement) payable with respect to each
such share upon the occurrence of a



 

-2-  "Deemed Liquidation Event" as contemplated by and provided for in the
Companys certificate of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). No share of
Company Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, remain outstanding or
represent any ownership interest in the Surviving Corporation and all such
shares shall represent solely the right to receive the accumulated Per Share
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement. No interest shall be
payable on the Per Share Merger Consideration payable hereunder on account of
Company Stock, irrespective of the time of the actual payment thereof.
Without limitation of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, each share of
Company Stock, by virtue of the Merger, shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and the holders of Company Stock shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to the Surviving Corporation or the Company
Stock except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor,
if any, as provided herein (whether upon consummation of the Merger or upon
release of the portion thereof held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement).

(b) _Shares of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall convert into and become one share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall, as of
the Effective Time, constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Treasury Shares of Company_. All shares of Company Stock held in the
treasury of the Company and each share of Company Stock owned or otherwise
held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(d) _Effect of Merger on Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Company Stock (a " _Warrant_ ")
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Warrant multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration for the class of Company Stock subject to such
Warrant (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, and _provided_ , that with
respect to Warrants to purchase Company Preferred Stock the effect of any
accrued but unpaid dividends on such calculation shall be eliminated) over
the per share exercise price set forth in such Warrant, subject to all of the
terms, provisions, limitations and procedures of this Agreement. In the event
the exercise price of any Warrant is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration for the class of Company Stock subject to such Warrant,
such Warrant shall be cancelled without payment therefor and shall have no
further force or effect. The exchange of the Warrants in accordance with this
Section 2.4(d) is intended to be treated for US federal income tax purposes as
a sale of the Warrants by their holders.

 

(e) _Effect of Merger on Options_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding Vested Option for which the Company receives a signed Transmittal
Letter shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Vested Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Merger Consideration for the class of Company Stock subject to such
Vested Option (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, including Sections
2.5(b) and 2.10) over the per

 



 

-3-  share exercise price set forth in such Vested Option, subject to all of the
terms, provisions, limitations and procedures of this Agreement and less any
applicable withholding taxes. In the event the exercise price of any Vested
Option for which the Company receives a signed Transmittal Letter is equal to
or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration for the class of Company
Stock subject to such Vested Option, such Vested Option shall be cancelled
without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect. In the
event the Effective Time occurs prior to the Exercise Expiration Date of a
Vested Option for which the Company does not receive a signed optionholder
Transmittal Letter, the holder of such Vested Option may, in lieu of the
consideration payable under this Section 2.4(e), exercise such Vested Option
in accordance with its terms (including payment of the exercise price to the
Company) prior to the Exercise Expiration Date and be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration payable to a Stockholder under Section 2.4(a)
for the class and number of shares of Company Stock that would otherwise be
issuable upon such exercise (subject to the terms of Section 2.4(a) and less
any applicable withholding taxes). From and after the Effective Time no Option
shall continue to be exercisable for capital stock of the Company, and upon
valid exercise of any such Option, the holder will be entitled to receive
upon exercise and payment of the applicable exercise price solely cash equal
to the amount that would have been paid to such holder had such holder
exercised such Option prior the Effective Time. From and after the Exercise
Expiration Date, the holder of any Vested Option that ceased to be exercisable
on the Exercise Expiration Date shall, upon delivering to the Company a signed
Transmittal Letter with respect to such Vested Option, be entitled to receive
the same amount that such holder would have received had such holder
submitted such Transmittal Letter prior to the Effective Time. As of the
Effective Time, the Stock Plan shall terminate and all rights under any
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest
in respect of the Capital Securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
and all Options (including Vested Options and unvested Options) shall be
cancelled subject to the preceding provisions of this Section 2.4(e).

(f) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock (other than shares held in the treasury of the Company) that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and has properly
exercised and perfected such holders appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the Act (the " _Dissenting Shares_ " and any such holder, a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the consideration provided for in Section 2.4, but shall, as of the Effective
Time, be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the Act, unless
and until such holder fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses,
its right to dissent from the Merger under the Act and to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the Act. If any such
Dissenting Stockholder shall have so failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holders Company
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been automatically converted into and
to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the consideration provided for in this Section 2.4.

 



 

-4- (ii) The Company shall deliver to Stockholders Representative and the Buyer
prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal received by the Company,
and of withdrawals of such demands, and shall provide copies of any documents
or instruments served pursuant to the Act, and shall permit
Stockholders Representative to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Stockholders Representative, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

(g) _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and there shall not
be any further registrations of transfers of any shares of Company Capital
Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.

 

2.5 _Purchase Price; Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Base Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Buyer on
account of the Merger is One Hundred Twenty-Four Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($124,500,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), subject to
adjustment as set forth below. In no event shall the aggregate amount of the
disbursements set forth in Section 2.9(b) exceed the Estimated Purchase
Price.

(b) _Adjustments_. The Base Purchase Price shall be (i) decreased by (A) an
amount, if any, by which the Companys Working Capital on the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Working Capital_ ") is less than Three Million Dollars
($3,000,000) (such amount, if any, the " _Working Capital Shortfall_ ")
and (B) the aggregate amount, if any, of Indebtedness outstanding on the
Closing Date (the " _Outstanding Debt_ ") and (ii) increased by an amount, if
any, by which the Closing Working Capital is greater than Three Million
Dollars ($3,000,000) (such amount, if any, the " _Working Capital Surplus_
").

-5- 2.7 _Final Determination of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Stockholders Representative a final unaudited consolidated balance sheet for
the Company as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Procedures (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be accompanied by Buyers certificate (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate_ ") setting forth Buyers reasonably detailed calculations,
derived from the Closing Balance Sheet, of the Base Purchase Price and each
component of adjustments to the Base Purchase Price in accordance with
Section 2.5(b), and the differences, if any, between such calculations and the
Estimated Purchase Price. Stockholders Representative may dispute amounts
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations set forth on the
Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate by notifying Buyer in writing on or
before the 30th day following Stockholders Representatives receipt
thereof, which notice shall specify each item in dispute and the amount
thereof, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such
dispute. In the event Stockholders Representative so notifies Buyer of any
such dispute, Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall work together in
good faith to resolve such dispute. In the event Buyer and Stockholders
Representative are unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days
following Stockholders Representative notifying Buyer of a dispute, Buyer or
Stockholders Representative shall submit a list of the disputed amounts and
any related issues to the other and to Grant Thornton LLP (who will serve as
experts and not as arbitrators on the disputes submitted for resolution) (the
" _Accountants_ ") for resolution. Buyer and Stockholders Representative
shall request that the disputed issues be resolved as promptly as possible by
the Accountants. The decision of the Accountants shall be final and binding
as to the matter(s) submitted to the Accountants for resolution. The costs of
the Accountants shall be borne by and apportioned among Buyer and the
Stockholders, severally (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares), as determined by the Accountants based upon the Accountants
determination of the relative merits of the parties claims giving rise to any
dispute. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate
and the calculation of the adjustments to the Base Purchase Price in
accordance with Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed final for all purposes hereof
upon the earliest to occur of (i) receipt by Buyer of a written notice
from Stockholders Representative stating that Stockholders Representative
agrees with Buyers calculations set forth thereon, (ii) the failure by
Stockholders Representative to notify Buyer of a dispute with respect thereto
in accordance with this Section 2.7(a) within 30 days of Stockholders
Representatives receipt from Buyer of the Closing Balance Sheet and Purchase
Price Adjustment Certificate and (iii) the resolution of all disputes arising
in accordance with this Section 2.7(a) either by Buyer and Stockholders
Representative or the Accountants, in which case the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate and the calculation of the
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.5(b)
shall be that determined in accordance with such resolution of all such
disputes (the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted in accordance with Section
2.5(b) and as finally agreed to by Buyer and Stockholders Representative, or
as otherwise determined, in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.7(a) is referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_ ").

 

(b) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then the Buyer or the Company shall deliver to each Stockholder an amount in
immediately available funds equal to (x) the remainder of the Final Purchase
Price minus the Estimated Purchase Price,

 



 

-6-  multiplied by (y) such Stockholders Proportionate Escrow Share as set forth
in the Closing Exhibit E.

 

(c) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then the Buyer and Stockholders Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer or the Company (as determined by Buyer) out
of the Working Capital Escrow an amount in immediately available funds equal
to the remainder of the Estimated Purchase Price minus the Final
Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , if and to the extent the funds in
the Working Capital Escrow Account are insufficient to make the full payment
required by this Section 2.7(b), then the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
remaining amount due to the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

(d) If there remains a balance in the Working Capital Escrow Account
after giving effect to the foregoing payments and all payments to be made
pursuant to Section 8.1, then Buyer shall provide written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release the Working Capital Escrow Amount to the Stockholders
Representative (for the benefit of the Stockholders in accordance with their
Pro Proportionate Escrow Share as set forth in the Closing Exhibit E) in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

2.7(a) or, if later, on the 180th day following the Closing Date.

 

(b) If the Phase II Report shall have been received prior to Closing and the
Phase II Report shall not recommend any Remedial Action, then there shall be
no Environmental Remediation Escrow Deposit. If the Phase II Report shall have
been received prior to Closing and it recommends Remedial Action, then the
amount of the Environmental Remediation Escrow Deposit shall be 150% of
the amount of Environmental Losses reasonably estimated by Buyer (but not
more than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000)). If the
Phase II Report is not received prior to Closing, then the Environmental

appropriate to 150% of the amount of Environmental Losses reasonably
estimated by Buyer and Buyer shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to
disburse to the Stockholders Representative any excess of Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) over the adjusted amount. If during
the course of the Remedial Actions it becomes manifest to Buyer that the
amount of the Environmental Remediation Escrow Deposit exceeds 150% of the
remaining Environmental Losses reasonably estimated by Buyer, Buyer shall 



 

-10-  promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Stockholders
Representative any excess of the amount of the Environmental Remediation
Escrow Deposit over 150% of the remaining Environmental Losses reasonably
estimated by Buyer. Upon completion of all Remedial Action, Buyer shall

, that if there are any asserted but unresolved claims for indemnity by Buyer
as of the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the full amount of such claims shall
be retained and held in the Indemnity Escrow in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement until such claims are finally resolved, at which time such amounts
will be disbursed to Buyer and the Stockholders Representative (for the
ratable benefit of the Stockholders in accordance with their
Proportionate Escrow Share) in such relative amounts as will give effect to
the final resolution of such claims.

2.11 _Stockholders  Representative_.

action that Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion, may
consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out
or for the accomplishment of the activities described in this Section 2.11 and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Escrow Agreement.
The powers of attorney granted under this Section 2.11, and all authority
hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be
terminated by any act of any Stockholder, by operation of law, whether by
such persons death, disability, protective supervision or any other event.
Without limiting the foregoing, these powers of attorney are to ensure the
performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, by approval of the
Merger, or by executing a Transmittal Letter, each Stockholder, shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, be deemed to have waived and renounced such
Stockholders right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally.
By approval of the Merger or by executing a Transmittal Letter, each

shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be liable to any
Stockholder in connection with the performance by Stockholders Representative
of its duties in the absence of reckless or intentional misconduct on the
part of Stockholders Representative as to the interests of the Stockholders.
Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this Section 2.11, no
agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be
ineffective solely by reason of a Stockholder (instead of Stockholders
Representative) having signed or delivered the same directly.

(b) Each Stockholder hereby agrees that Stockholders Representative shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be indemnified and held harmless by
the Stockholders, severally (in accordance with their respective Proportionate
Escrow Share) from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without reckless or intentional misconduct on the part of Stockholders
Representative toward the Stockholders and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder as to the
interests of the Stockholders. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by Stockholders Representative in connection

 



 

-12-  with actions taken by Stockholders Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of
legal fees and costs (collectively, the " _Representative Expenses_ ") shall
be the responsibility of the Stockholders, severally (in accordance with their
respective Proportionate Escrow Share). Upon final distribution of the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, the Environmental Remediation Escrow Amount or the
Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to retain, out of the aggregate

Escrow or the Indemnity Escrow that otherwise are to be distributed to the

to the Stockholders (in proportion to their respective Proportionate Escrow
Share) any Expense Fund Amount not used or reserved to pay Representative
Expenses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Stockholders
Representative shall have full power and authority to interpret all the terms
and provisions of this Merger Agreement, and to consent to any amendment
hereof or thereof, on behalf of all the Stockholders and their respective
heirs, successors and assigns.

 

(c) Stockholders who in the aggregate are entitled to receive a majority of
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4 shall
have the right at any time to remove the then-acting Stockholders
Representative and to appoint a successor Stockholders Representative;
_provided_ , that the successor Stockholders Representative so appointed
accepts the duties of Stockholders Representative and agrees to perform and
be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to
Stockholders Representative. Each successor Stockholders Representative
shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by
this Agreement upon the original Stockholders Representative, and the term
"Stockholders Representative" as used herein and shall be deemed to include
any interim or successor Stockholders Representative.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
shall act on its own behalf at all times prior to the Effective Time, shall

ARTICLE 7

Stockholders, severally in proportion to their Proportionate Escrow Share,
shall, prior to the Limitation Date, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, Merger
Sub, their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and successors in
interest (" _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and reimburse them for,
any and all demands, claims, losses, suits, liabilities, actions or causes of
action, assessments, damages, fines, Taxes, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and amounts
paid in settlement) (collectively " _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by any
Buyer Indemnitees arising out of, resulting from, or relating to any of the
following: 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Company in
this Agreement or in any of the other agreements or certificates delivered by
Company in accordance with the terms hereof;



 

-41- (b) any failure by Company to perform or any default by Company in any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any of the other
agreement or certificate delivered by Company in accordance with the terms
hereof; or

 

(c) any claim by any Stockholder relating to the Companys determination of
the allocable portion of the Estimated Purchase Price or the Final Purchase
Price that such Stockholder is entitled to receive in connection with the
Merger.

7.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall, and after the Closing the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, indemnify and hold harmless the
Stockholders and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives and successors in interest (" _Stockholder
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by
any Stockholder Indemnitees arising out of, resulting from, or relating to any
of the following:

 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Buyer or
Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any of the other agreements or
certificates delivered by Buyer or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms
hereof; or

(b) any failure by Buyer or Merger Sub to perform or any default by Buyer or
Merger Sub of any of its respective covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or in any of the other agreement or certificate delivered by Buyer
or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms hereof.

7.3 _Time and Monetary Limitations_. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section 7.3.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any Stockholder shall be obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees and Buyer shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Stockholder Indemnitees for any Losses under Section 7.1 or 7.2, as
applicable, unless such party is delivered written notice in accordance with
Sections 7.4 and 11.4 asserting a claim with respect thereto and stating the
factual basis of the claim and extent of the Losses in reasonable detail, to
the extent then known, on or before the earlier of ( _x_ ) the Indemnity
Escrow Release Date (as of which date the representations and warranties set
forth herein shall expire) or ( _y_ ) the first anniversary of the date this
Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 9.1 (the " _Limitation Date_ ").

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any Stockholder shall be obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees and Buyer shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Stockholder Indemnitees for any Losses under Section 7.1(a) or 7.2(a), as
applicable, until the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Buyer
Indemnitees or the Stockholder Indemnitees, as the case may be, exceeds
$1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnitees or
Stockholder Indemnitees, as applicable, shall, subject to the Cap and other
terms and conditions hereof, be indemnified for all Losses from the first
dollar thereof. 

(c) Subject to Section 7.3(d), the maximum aggregate amount for which the
Company or the Stockholders are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
(i) for all matters under Section 7.1 is the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the "
_Cap_ ") and (ii) for all matters under Section 7.8 is the sum of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Environmental



 

-42-  Remediation Escrow Amount. Neither the Company nor the Stockholders shall
have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for the removal or
replacement of the USTs. Subject to 7.3(d), following the Effective Time, the
sole source of recovery with respect to any claims against the Stockholders
under this Agreement shall be the applicable amounts held in escrow under the
Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) the
limitations set forth in this Section 7.3 shall not be applicable to any
Losses incurred as a result of knowing and intentional breach of covenant
committed by or on behalf of the Company, and (ii) no Persons liability shall
be limited in any way for such Persons intentional fraud or knowing and
intentional concealment.

7.4 _Procedure_.

 

(a) In the event that any party hereto shall sustain or incur any Losses in
respect of which indemnification may be sought by such Person pursuant to
this Article 7, the Person seeking such indemnification (the " _Indemnitee_ ")
shall assert a claim for indemnification (" _Indemnification Claim_ ") by
giving prompt written notice thereof (the " _Notice_ ") to the party ( _i.e._
, Company prior to the Closing or the Stockholders through the Stockholders
Representative after the Closing, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other)
providing indemnification (the " _Indemnitor_ ") and shall thereafter keep
the Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto; _provided_ that
failure of the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor prompt written notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any of its obligations
hereunder except and to the extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Notice shall set forth with reasonable
particularity the basis for the Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitees
good faith estimate of Losses resulting from such Indemnification Claim to the
extent known. Any dispute relating to an Indemnification Claim shall be
resolved by (i) the mutual agreement of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, or
(ii) a final order, decree or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
(the time for appeal having expired and no appeal having been perfected).

 

(b) In case any third party claim, action, suit or proceeding, including a
claim, action, suit or proceeding asserted by a Governmental Authority (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), is brought against any Indemnitee, the Indemnitor
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such
Third Party Claim, it shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnitees consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement includes as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a release of the
Indemnitee, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from all liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim and imposes no obligations on the Indemnitee
other than the payment of monetary damages which are to be satisfied solely
by the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnitor of the
defense of any Third Party Claim as provided in this subsection, the
Indemnitee shall be permitted to join in the defense of such Third Party
Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by
Indemnitor has a material conflict of interest because of the availability
of different or additional defenses to such Indemnitee or other facts that
the conflict of interest cannot be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Indemnitee by the consent of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee to the
joint 



 

-43-  representation, then such Indemnitee shall have the right to select separate
counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor, to participate in the
defense of such action on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnitor.

(c) If the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, then
the Indemnitee may assume the defense thereof, in which event it may do so in
such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate.

(d) Amounts payable by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee in respect of any
Losses for which such party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be
payable by the Indemnitor as incurred by the Indemnitee, except to the extent
that the claim for indemnification is disputed, and shall include reasonable
costs, expenses and attorneys fees incurred in successfully enforcing an
Indemnitees right of indemnification against any Indemnitor, including with
respect to any successful appeal. The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall
provide reasonable cooperation and assistance, and shall cause their
Affiliates to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance, to the other and
its counsel in connection with the defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim. Any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates in providing
such cooperation and assistance at the Indemnitors request shall be paid by
the Indemnitor to the extent such expenses constitute Losses that the
Indemnitor is required to indemnify against under this Article 7\.

7.5 _Other Limitations_. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 7, the
parties shall cooperate with each other to obtain the benefits of any
insurance coverage for Third Party Claims that may be in effect at the time a
Third Party Claim is asserted, and, if any insurance carrier for the Company,
any Affiliate of the Company, Buyer, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries is
obligated or agrees to defend any Third Party Claim, such defense shall be
tendered to such insurance carrier and the rights of the parties among
themselves regarding the assumption and control of such defense shall be
subject to the reasonable requirements of such insurance carrier. Nothing
contained herein shall obligate any party to obtain or continue after the
Closing any insurance coverage for any period.

 

(b) The amount of any Losses of any Person subject to indemnification under
this Article 7 shall be reduced by the amount, if any, (i) actually received
by the Indemnitee from any insurance company or other insurance provider (such
amount being referred to herein as a " _Third Party Reimbursement_ "), in
respect of the Losses suffered thereby; (ii) reserved or accrued on the
Closing Balance Sheet with respect to the matters or items giving rise to such
Losses; and (iii) any tax benefit attributable to such Losses. If, after
receipt by an Indemnitee of any indemnification payment hereunder, such
Person receives or becomes entitled to receive a Third Party Reimbursement in
respect of the same Losses for which indemnification was made and such Third
Party Reimbursement was not taken into account in assessing the amount
of indemnification, then the Indemnitee shall turn over all of such Third
Party Reimbursement to the Indemnitor up to the amount of the indemnification
paid pursuant hereto.

 

(c) No party shall have any liability for any Loss that would not have arisen
but for any alteration or repeal or enactment of any law after the Closing
Date.



 

-44- (d) The Company shall have no liability for any Loss that would not have
arisen but for any change in the accounting policies, practices or procedures
adopted by Buyer or its Affiliates or for any other act or omission by Buyer
or its Affiliates after the Closing Date.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any limitation
or qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of an Indemnitors
obligations (including for purposes of determining whether the amount of the
Indemnitors indemnification obligations exceed the Basket), as well as
for purposes of determining whether there has been any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement provided
that a Buyer Indemnified Party incurred Loss with respect thereto, it being
intended, for example, that all instances of noncompliance with law or
contractual obligations by the Company or a Subsidiary if indemnifiable
without regard to materiality shall be subject to indemnification hereunder
once the Basket has been satisfied.

 

7.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Buyer and the Company agree to
treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

7.7  _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and payment
or reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, and all exculpations and limitations of personal
liability, related to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the negotiation, execution
or performance of transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing
in favor of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be
(such persons, directors or officers collectively, the " _Company D andO
Indemnitees_"), of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
with respect to any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such claim. For a period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall and Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) maintain in effect the current
provisions regarding indemnification of the Company DandO Indemnitees contained
in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or provisions no less
advantageous to the Company DandO Indemnitees in comparable organizational
documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company DandO Indemnitees to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including advances for reasonable fees and expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that such person
is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines and, subject to approval
by the Surviving Corporation (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, suit or cause of action, whether 



 

-45-  civil, criminal or administrative, to which such Company DandO Indemnitee is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such
individual is or was a director or officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer or employee of another person or
(ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or
purchase a "tail policy," in either case, of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the Company DandO Indemnitees with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay, with
respect to such insurance policies, in respect of any one policy year more
than two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance under the current period ending December 1, 2010
(as set forth on _Schedule 7.7(b)_ hereto, the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 7.7(b) it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

 

(c) Any Company DandO Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.7, upon learning of any such claim, suit or
cause of action, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation or Buyer of any liability
it may have to such Company DandO Indemnitee, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
suit or cause of action, (arising after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Company DandO Indemnitees (which acceptance shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Surviving
Corporation and the Buyer shall not be liable to such Company DandO Indemnitees
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Company DandO Indemnitees in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Company DandO Indemnitee or advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and
the Company DandO Indemnitees, or between the Company DandO Indemnitees, the
Company DandO Indemnitees may retain counsel satisfactory to it, and the
Surviving Corporation or the Buyer shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Company DandO Indemnitees promptly as statements
therefor are received; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 7.7(c) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Company DandO Indemnitees in any jurisdiction unless
the use of one counsel for such Company DandO Indemnitees would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the Company DandO Indemnitees will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any 



 

-46-  Company DandO Indemnitee if and to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Company DandO
Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(d) This Section 7.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Company DandO Indemnitees and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Buyer, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Company DandO Indemnitees shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this Section 7.7.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

7.8 _Indemnification for Environmental Losses_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in addition
to, and without limiting the generality of, the indemnifications obligations
of the Company and the Stockholders under Section 7.1, the Company, and after
the Closing the Stockholders, severally in proportion to their Proportionate
Escrow Share, shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against, and
reimburse them for, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee arising out of, result from, or relating to: the performance of any
remedial measures recommended in the Phase II Report or any condition or
conditions giving rise thereto other than the replacement or removal of the
USTs, whether or not replacement or removal of the USTs is recommended in the
Phase II Report (any Losses described in this Section 7.8(a), the "
_Environmental Losses_ " and the actions described in this sentence, the "
_Remedial Actions_ ").

(b) Any Environmental Losses with respect to which the Company or the
Stockholders have an indemnification obligation under Section 7.8(a) shall be
paid to the Buyer Indemnitees out of the Environmental Remediation Escrow in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that,
if and only to the extent the Environmental Remediation Amount is insufficient
to make the full payment required to be made to the Buyer Indemnitees by this
Section 7.8, then the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining amount due to
the Buyer Indemnitees from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, without regard to
whether the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees at
such time exceeds the Basket.

 

(c) There shall in no event be any minimum dollar threshold with respect to
any Environmental Losses that is required to be exceeded in order for the
Buyer Indemnitees to be entitled to reimbursement for Environmental Losses
under this Section 7.8.

(d) Environmental Losses indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall not
be taken into account in determining whether the Basket has been exceeded.



 

-47- (e) The Buyer shall be entitled to control any Remedial Action, but shall
consult the Stockholders Representative with respect thereto and, upon
request of the Stockholders Representative, shall inform the Stockholders
Representative of the status thereof. The Buyer shall direct that the Remedial
Action be undertaken in a commercially reasonable manner with view toward
timely and economically completion, _provided_ , that the Buyer shall have no
obligation to select the least costly method of remediation and may utilize
its discretion in determining Remedial Action and the conduct thereof that
complies in all material respects with applicable Environmental Laws and is
reasonably necessary to accomplish the objective of the Remedial Action. Buyer
shall request that the Environmental Consultant permit, to the extent
practicable and reasonable, the Stockholders Representative (or its
consultants or representatives) to observe the work being undertaken provided
that (i) said persons comply with any reasonable health or safety
requirements imposed by the Environmental Consultant and contractors hired by
Buyer to perform the work and (ii) said persons do not interfere with or seek
to direct the work.

 

(f) The Buyer shall engage the Environmental Consultant, direct that the Phase
II assessment be undertaken and the Phase II Report be delivered
contemporaneously to Buyer and the Stockholders Representative, in each case
as soon as reasonably possible.

 

ARTICLE 8

 

 _TAX_

8.1  _Filing Responsibility_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility and payment of Taxes as between Buyer and the
Stockholders for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

 

(a) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date that are filed after the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit Stockholders
Representative to review and approve each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing. The
Stockholders shall severally, reimburse Buyer solely from the Working Capital
Escrow Amount held in the Working Capital Escrow for Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to such periods within fifteen (15) days after
payment by Buyer or the Company and its Subsidiaries of such Taxes to the
extent such Taxes were not reflected as a liability in determining the Final
Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 2.5 through 2.7 of this Agreement.

(b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods that begin before
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
permit Stockholders Representative to review and approve each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence at least 15 days prior to filing
for the portion of each such Tax Return that includes the period ending on the
Closing Date. The Stockholders shall severally pay to Buyer solely from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount held in the Working Capital Escrow within
fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such
periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes
were not reflected as a liability in

 



 

-48-  determining the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 2.5 through 2.7 of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 8.1(b), in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that
relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (
_x_ ) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Tax period, and ( _y_ ) in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.
Any credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period
ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to
the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with
reasonable prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Any amounts payable to Buyer pursuant to this Article 8 shall be paid
solely from the Working Capital Escrow Amount.

 

8.2 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Stockholders Representative
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries and
Stockholders Representative agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating
to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or
Stockholders Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Taxing Authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records.

 

(b) Buyer and Stockholders Representative further agree, upon request, to use
their Best Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

8.3 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

-49- 8.4 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid 50% by the
Stockholders Representative and 50% by the Buyer when due, and the Buyer
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfers, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.

 

ARTICLE 9

terminated and abandoned, by written notice given to the other party hereto,
at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

 

(b) by either Buyer or the Company, if any Governmental Authority shall have

or otherwise permanently prohibiting the Merger (which Buyer and the Company
shall have used their respective Best Efforts to have lifted or reversed) and
such Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; 

(c) by Buyer, if, as of any date, the Company shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties or covenants such that any of the conditions set

(e) by Stockholders Representative or Buyer if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the date that is six months after the date of this
Agreement (the " _Outside Date_ ");

provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1 shall not be available to any party that has breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner shall have
proximately caused the occurrence of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement (other than the agreements of the
parties hereto contained in this Section 9.2, Article 7 and Article 11, which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) shall become null and void
and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any
of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, equity holders, agents,
legal and financial advisors or other representatives), except to the extent
that such termination results from a material breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

condition or other provisions thereof or default in connection therewith. The
waiver of any covenant, term, condition or other provision thereof or default
thereunder shall not affect or alter this Agreement in any other respect, and
each and every covenant, term, condition or other provision of this Agreement

Agreement; rather the parties have agreed that should any representations and

Section 7.3(d), have the specific rights and remedies herein specified as the
exclusive remedy therefor, but that no other rights, remedies or causes of
action (whether in law or in equity or whether in contract or in tort) are
permitted to any party hereto as a result of the untruth of any such
representation and warranty.

warranties expressly made by the Company in Article 3 of this Agreement,

liabilities, operations, prospects, or condition (financial or otherwise),
including with respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose of any assets, the nature or extent of any liabilities, the prospects
of the Business, the effectiveness or the success of any operations, or the
accuracy or completeness of any confidential information memoranda,
documents, projections, material or other information (financial or
otherwise) regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary furnished to Buyer
or its representatives or made available to Buyer and its representatives in
any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated hereby, or in respect of any other matter or thing whatsoever,
and (B) no Representative of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
has any authority, express or implied, to make any representations, warranties
or agreements not specifically set forth in this Agreement and subject to the
remedies herein provided. Except for the specific representations and

and acknowledges and agrees that the Company has specifically disclaimed



 

-53-  and does hereby specifically disclaim any such other representation or
warranty made by any Person. Buyer specifically disclaims any obligation or
duty by the Company or Stockholders Representative to make any disclosures
of fact not required to be disclosed pursuant to the specific representations
and warranties expressly made by the Company and set forth in Article 3 of
this Agreement. Buyer is acquiring the Company subject only to the specific
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company and set forth in
Article 3 of this Agreement as further limited by the specifically bargained-
for exclusive remedies as set forth in Article 7. 

11.7 _Non-Recourse_. Subject to Section 7.3(d), no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, Stockholder
(except as expressly provided in Articles 7 and 8 and subject to the
limitations set forth therein), Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative
of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of the Company arising
under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the sale and purchase of the Company,
including, without limitation, any alleged non-disclosure or
misrepresentations made by any the Company.

11.8  _Exclusive Remedies_. Following the Closing and subject to Section
7.3(d), the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims arising under,
out of, or related to this Agreement, or the sale and purchase of the Company,
shall be the rights set forth in Articles 7 and 8 only, and no person will
have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties hereto to the
fullest extent permitted by law. The sole and exclusive remedies for any
breach of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including any
representations and warranties set forth herein, made in connection herewith
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) or any claim or cause of
action otherwise arising out of or related to the sale and purchase of the
Company shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of
contract only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or
excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties
hereby agree that no party hereto shall have any remedies or cause of action
(whether in contract or in tort) for any statements, communications,
disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth
in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the limitations set forth in this
sentence are subject to and qualified by Section 7.3(d). The provisions of
this Section 11.8, together with the provisions of Sections 11.5, 11.6 and
11.7, and the remedies specified in Articles 7 and 8, were specifically
bargained-for between Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and Stockholders
Representative and were taken into account by Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company
and Stockholders Representative in agreeing to the amount of the Base
Purchase Price, the adjustments thereto and the other terms and conditions
hereof. The Company and Stockholders Representative have specifically relied
upon the provisions of this Section 11.8, together with the provisions of
Sections 11.5, 11.6 and 11.7, and the remedies specified in Articles 7 and 8,
in agreeing to the Base Purchase Price, the adjustments thereto and the other
terms and conditions hereof, including in agreeing to provide the specific
representations and warranties set forth herein.

 

11.9 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement shall be held
or deemed to be, or shall in fact be, invalid, inoperative, illegal or
unenforceable as applied to any particular case in any jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, or in all jurisdictions or in all cases, because of the

 



 

-54-  conflicting of any provision with any constitution or statute or rule of
public policy or for any other reason, such circumstance shall not have the
effect of rendering the provision or provisions in question invalid,
inoperative, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction or in any
other case or circumstance or of rendering any other provision or provisions
herein contained invalid, inoperative, illegal or unenforceable to the extent
that such other provisions are not themselves actually in conflict with such
constitution, statute or rule of public policy, but this Agreement shall be
narrowly reformed and construed in any such jurisdiction or case as if such
invalid, inoperative, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein and such provision narrowly reformed so that it would be
valid, operative and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted in such
jurisdiction or in such case. 

11.10 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument, binding upon all of the
parties. To the extent permitted by Law, in pleading or proving any provision
of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce more than one set of
such counterparts. Signatures provided by facsimile or electronic copy shall
have the same effect as originals.

 

11.11 _Section Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

11.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to his Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed
by the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made
and to be performed solely therein (without giving effect to any principles
of conflicts or choice of law thereof that would give rise to the application
of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction). In connection
with any controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement, Company,
Stockholders Representative, Merger Sub and Buyer hereby irrevocably consent
and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have proper jurisdiction, any
Delaware state court, and agree all such controversies shall be resolved
solely in such jurisdiction. In connection with any controversy arising out of
or relating to the Agreement, the Company, Stockholders Representative, the
Merger Sub and the Buyer irrevocably (a) consents to service of process out of
the aforementioned courts, (b) WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND ANY OBJECTION
THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE
AFOREMENTIONED COURTS, (c) agrees that service of process in any such Legal
Action may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be effected by mailing a
copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially
similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its address as
provided in Section 11.4, and (d) agrees that nothing in the Agreement shall
affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by
the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

-55- 11.13 _Further Acts_. Each party agrees that at any time, and from time to
time, before and after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, it will do all such things and execute and deliver all other
assurances, as any other party or its counsel reasonably deems necessary or
desirable in order to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby or to facilitate the enjoyment of any
of the rights created hereby or to be created hereunder.

 

11.14 _Entire Agreement; Construction; No Implied Warranties_. This Agreement
(together with the Disclosure Schedule, the other schedules and exhibits
hereto and the other documents delivered or to be delivered in connection
herewith) constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and contemporaneous, arrangements, covenants, promises, conditions,
undertakings, inducements, representations, warranties and negotiations,
expressed or implied, oral or written, between the parties, with respect to
the subject matter hereof. Each of the parties is a sophisticated Person that
was advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary,
other advisors in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the Merger exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms
and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim
that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly
set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge
that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated
parties derived from arms-length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement
specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with
another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

 

11.15 _Retention of Counsel_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement, each of the Stockholders Representative and
Stockholders shall have the right, at their election, to retain either or both
of Edwards Angell Palmer and Dodge LLP or Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP to
represent them in such matter, and Buyer, for itself and the Company and
Merger Sub and for its and such Persons respective successors and assigns,
hereby irrevocably waives and consents to any such representation in any such
matter and the communication by such counsel to the Stockholders
Representative and Stockholders in connection with any such representation of
any fact known to such counsel arising by reason of such counsels prior
representation of the Company or any Subsidiary. Buyer, for itself and the
Company, and for its and such respective Persons Affiliates, successors and
assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between
or among the Company, any of the Stockholders and counsel, including Edwards
Angell Palmer and Dodge LLP or Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP made in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or
any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement, or otherwise that, immediately prior to the Closing, would be
deemed to be privileged communications of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and their counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to
Buyer in connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing
and for all purposes be deemed to be privileged communications between
the Stockholders Representative or Stockholders and such counsel and neither
Buyer nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer shall
seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
