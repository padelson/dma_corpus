Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, (i) upon the consummation of

(a) _Conversion of MSLO Common Stock and Madeline Merger Sub Common
Stock_. As of the MSLO Effective Time, by virtue of the MSLO Merger
and without any action on the part of MSLO, TopCo, Madeline Merger Sub or the
holders of any shares of MSLO Common Stock (or options thereon) or TopCo
Common Stock:

  



  

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of MSLO Common Stock (other
than any shares of MSLO Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ and subject to _Section 2.1(f)_ ) shall be converted into
the right to receive (A) in the case of a share of MSLO Common Stock with
respect to which an election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been
properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (each, a "
_Cash Election Share_ "), $6.15 in cash, without interest (the " _MSLO Cash
Consideration_ "), (B) in the case of a share of MSLO Common Stock with
respect to which an election to receive stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") has
been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (each, a
" _Stock Election Share_ "), a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of TopCo Common Stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of
TopCo Common Stock as specified below, without interest, equal to the
quotient determined by dividing (x) the MSLO Cash Consideration by (y) the
Sequential Trading Price (the " _MSLO Stock Consideration_ " and, together
with the MSLO Cash Consideration, the " _MSLO Merger Consideration_ ") or (C)
in the case of a share of MSLO Common Stock with respect to which neither a
Cash Election nor a Stock Election has been properly made and not revoked or
lost pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (each, a " _Non-Election Share_ "), the MSLO
Cash Consideration or the MSLO Stock Consideration or a combination of both,
subject in each case to _Section 2.4_. As of the MSLO Effective Time, all
such shares of MSLO Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of the
MSLO Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or book-entry share
representing any shares of MSLO Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender thereof,
subject to _Section 2.1(f)_ , the MSLO Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(ii) Each share of common stock of Madeline Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the MSLO Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of
the MSLO Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(iii) The " _Sequential Trading Price_ " shall mean the volume
weighted average price per share of Sequential Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") for the consecutive period over the five trading
days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as
calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "VWAP".

--- 

    



  

(iv) The aggregate MSLO Cash Consideration received by each MSLO
Holder will be rounded to the nearest whole cent.

  



  

(b) _Conversion of Sequential Common Stock and Singer Merger Sub
Common Stock_. As of the Sequential Effective Time, by virtue of the
Sequential Merger and without any action on the part of Sequential, TopCo,
Singer Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of Sequential Common Stock (or
options thereon) or TopCo Common Stock:

  



  

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Sequential Common Stock
(other than any shares of Sequential Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive one fully paid
and nonassessable share of TopCo Common Stock (the " _Sequential Merger
Consideration_ " and, together with the MSLO Merger Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). Such exchange ratio shall be referred to herein as
the " _Sequential Exchange Ratio_ ". As of the Sequential Effective Time, all
such shares of Sequential Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of
the Sequential Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or book-
entry share representing any shares of Sequential Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender thereof, the Sequential Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.

  



  

(ii) Each share of common stock of Singer Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Sequential Effective Time shall be

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of MSLO Common
Stock held in the treasury of MSLO immediately prior to the MSLO Effective
Time, and each share of Sequential Common Stock held in the treasury of
Sequential immediately prior to the Sequential Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(d) _Treatment of MSLO Equity Awards_.

  



  

(i) Each outstanding option to acquire shares of MSLO Common Stock
that is subject solely to a time-based condition (a " _MSLO Stock Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the MSLO
Effective Time shall, as of the MSLO Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, the holder will be entitled to receive a cash payment
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of MSLO Common Stock
for which such MSLO Stock Option is exercisable and (B) the excess of the
MSLO Cash Consideration over the per share exercise price of such MSLO Stock
Option. In addition to the foregoing amounts, to the extent that any such MSLO
Stock Option that was granted pursuant to an employment agreement requirement
and is identified on Section 2.1(d)(i) of the MSLO Disclosure Schedule as
having also been subject to a performance vesting condition that has been
satisfied and having included a minimum post-termination exercise period of
18 months, the holder of such MSLO Stock Option shall receive the further
consideration (which shall be payable in the form) specified in such section
of the MSLO Disclosure Schedule. The amounts described in this _Section
2.1(d)(i)_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such MSLO Stock Options; _provided_ , that if
the exercise price per share of any such MSLO Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the MSLO Cash Consideration, such MSLO Stock Option shall be
cancelled without any payments being made or other consideration being
delivered in respect thereof.

(ii) Each outstanding option to acquire shares of MSLO Common Stock
that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a "
_MSLO Performance Stock Option_ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and vested as of the Effective Time (taking into
account the next-following sentence) shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the holder will be entitled to receive a
cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of MSLO Common
Stock for which such MSLO Performance Stock Option is exercisable and (B) the
excess of the MSLO Cash Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such MSLO Performance Stock Option. Each unvested MSLO Performance Stock
Option shall vest at the Effective Time, unless and to the extent that the
specified stock price condition(s) at which such MSLO Performance Stock
Option would have become vested in the ordinary course, as specified in the
applicable award agreement, are higher than the MSLO Cash Consideration. MSLO
Performance Stock Options that remain unvested at the Effective Time pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and in
exchange thereof, all such MSLO Performance Stock Options held by any single
holder shall collectively be converted into and thereafter evidence the right
to receive a cash payment in the amount set forth on Section 2.1(d)(ii)
of the MSLO Disclosure Schedule next to such holder's name. The amounts
described in this _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such MSLO Performance Stock
Options.

  



  

(iii) Each award of restricted stock units corresponding to shares of
MSLO Common Stock that is subject solely to a time-based vesting condition (a
" _MSLO RSU Award_ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior to the MSLO
Effective Time shall, as of the MSLO Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the MSLO Cash
Consideration for each share of MSLO Common Stock subject to such MSLO RSU
Award.

(iv) Each award of restricted stock units corresponding to shares of
MSLO Common Stock that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a
" _MSLO Performance RSU Award_ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior to
the MSLO Effective Time and becomes vested pursuant to the next-following
sentence shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive a cash payment equal to the MSLO Cash Consideration for each share
of MSLO Common Stock subject to such MSLO Performance RSU Award. Each unvested
MSLO Performance RSU Award shall vest at the MSLO Effective Time, unless and
to the extent that the specified stock price condition(s) at which such MSLO
Performance RSU Award would have become vested in the ordinary course, as
specified in the applicable award agreement, are higher than the MSLO Cash
Consideration. MSLO Performance RSU Awards that remain unvested at the MSLO
Effective Time pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and in exchange thereof, all such MSLO Performance RSU Awards
held by any single holder shall collectively be converted into and thereafter
evidence the right to receive a cash payment in the amount set forth on
Section 2.1(d)(iv) of the MSLO Disclosure Schedule next to such holder's
name. The amounts described in this _Section 2.1(d)(iv)_ that are payable in
respect to MSLO Performance RSU Awards shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such MSLO Performance RSU
Awards.

  



  

(v) Prior to the MSLO Effective Time, the Board of Directors of MSLO
or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for
the treatment of the MSLO Stock Options, MSLO Performance Stock Options, MSLO
RSU Awards and MSLO Performance RSU Awards (collectively, the " _MSLO Equity
Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.1(d)_. TopCo, MSLO and
Sequential shall cooperate to provide any required notices to the holders of
MSLO Equity Awards required in connection with the consummation of the
Mergers.

  



  

(vi) The aggregate cash payment made to each holder of MSLO Stock
Options, MSLO Performance Stock Options, MSLO RSU Awards and/or MSLO
Performance RSU Awards contemplated by this _Section 2.1(d)_ will be rounded
to the nearest whole cent. Any payments made with respect to the MSLO Equity
Awards shall be made by the MSLO Surviving Corporation through payroll
promptly after the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Treatment of Sequential Equity Awards and Warrants_.

  



  

(i) Each outstanding option to acquire shares of Sequential Common
Stock (a " _Sequential Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Sequential Effective Time shall, as of
the Sequential Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option to purchase, on the
terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) under the
applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Sequential Effective Time, (A) that number of shares of TopCo Common Stock,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product determined by
multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Sequential Common Stock subject
to such Sequential Stock Option immediately prior to the Sequential Effective
Time by (y) the Sequential Exchange Ratio, (B) at a per-share exercise price,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Sequential Common Stock at which
such Sequential Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Sequential Effective Time by (y) the Sequential Exchange Ratio.

(ii) Each award of restricted stock units corresponding to shares of
Sequential Common Stock (a " _Sequential RSU Award_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Sequential Effective
Time shall, as of the Sequential Effective Time, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a TopCo
restricted stock unit award on the terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Sequential Effective Time, with respect to a number
of shares of TopCo Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Sequential Common Stock
subject to such Sequential RSU Award immediately prior to the Sequential
Effective Time by the Sequential Exchange Ratio. To the extent that the
Sequential RSU Awards vest in whole or in part based on the achievement of
performance goals, the compensation committee of the Sequential Board shall
appropriately adjust such performance goals to reflect the effect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(iii) Each unvested award of restricted Sequential Common Stock (a "
_Sequential Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Sequential Effective Time shall, as of the Sequential Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a TopCo restricted stock award on the terms and conditions
(including applicable vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and
award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Sequential Effective
Time, with respect to a number of shares of TopCo Common Stock, rounded up to
the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Sequential Common Stock subject to such Sequential Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Sequential Effective Time by the Sequential Exchange
Ratio. To the extent that the Sequential Restricted Stock Awards vest in whole
or in part based on the achievement of performance goals, the compensation
committee of the Sequential Board shall appropriately adjust such performance
goals to reflect the effect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(iv) Each warrant to purchase any shares of Sequential Common Stock or
other equity interests (a " _Sequential Warrant_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into a warrant to purchase shares of TopCo
Common Stock on the terms and conditions (including applicable strike price
and vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of
shares of TopCo Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Sequential Common Stock
subject to such Sequential Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Sequential Exchange Ratio. TopCo and Sequential shall cooperate to provide
any required notices to the holders of Sequential Equity Awards and
Sequential Warrants required in connection with the consummation of
the Mergers.

(v) Prior to the Sequential Effective Time, the Sequential Board or
the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the
treatment of (i) the Sequential Stock Options, Sequential RSU Awards and
Sequential Restricted Stock Awards (collectively, the " _Sequential Equity
Awards_ ") and (ii) the Sequential Warrants, each as contemplated by this
_Section 2.1(e)_. As soon as practicable after the Sequential Effective Time,
TopCo shall prepare and file with the SEC a Form S-8 (or file such other
appropriate form) registering a number of shares of TopCo Common Stock
necessary to fulfill TopCo's obligations under this _Section 2.1(e)_. TopCo
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of TopCo Common Stock for delivery with respect to the
Sequential Equity Awards and Sequential Warrants assumed by it in
accordance with this _Section 2.1(e)_. TopCo and Sequential shall cooperate
to provide any required notices to the holders of Sequential Equity Awards
and Sequential Warrants required in connection with the consummation of the
Mergers.

  



  

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of MSLO Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the MSLO Effective Time that are held by any holder who
has not voted in favor of the MSLO Merger and who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the MSLO Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder's
right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect
or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of MSLO
Common Stock of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become
exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the MSLO
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been
irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the MSLO Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 2.1(f)_ , if this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Effective Time, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value
of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
will cease. MSLO shall serve prompt notice to Sequential of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of MSLO Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
notices or demands and any other instruments received by MSLO relating to
rights to appraisal, and Sequential shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. MSLO
shall not, without the prior written consent of Sequential, make any payment
with respect to, settle or offer to settle any such demands, and prior to the
Effective Time, Sequential shall not, without the prior written consent of
MSLO (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  



  

2.2 Exchange of Shares and Certificates.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. No later than five Business Days prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Sequential shall designate a bank,
trust company or nationally recognized shareholder services provider
reasonably acceptable to MSLO (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of
receiving Elections and exchanging, in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ ,
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Prior to the
Effective Time, TopCo shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered in respect
of the number of shares of TopCo Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
2.1_ in exchange for outstanding shares of MSLO Common Stock and shares of
Sequential Common Stock. In addition, at or prior to the MSLO Effective Time,
Sequential shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
for the benefit of the holders of shares of MSLO Common Stock at the MSLO
Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ ,
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate MSLO Cash Consideration
(other than in respect of any Dissenting Shares), including any additional
amounts necessary to fund the adjustment set forth in _Section
2.1(a)(iv)_. In addition, Sequential shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_. All shares of TopCo
Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
_Section 2.2_ shall be referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".
Sequential shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail (1) to each holder
of record of a certificate (a " _Sequential Certificate_ ") that immediately
prior to the Sequential Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Sequential Common Stock and (2) to each holder of record of a certificate (a "
_MSLO Certificate_ " and, together with a Sequential Certificate, a "
_Certificate_ ") that immediately prior to the MSLO Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of MSLO Common Stock, in each case whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(j)_ ) to the Exchange Agent, and
which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as agreed
among the parties hereto) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or affidavits of loss in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation or affidavit of loss to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
or affidavit of loss shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
that number of whole shares of TopCo Common Stock and/or cash, as applicable,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE II_ , and the Certificate or affidavit of loss so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not
later than the third Business Day thereafter, Sequential shall cause
the Exchange Agent to issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated
shares of Sequential Common Stock represented by book-entry (the "
_Sequential Book-Entry Shares_ ") and uncertificated shares of MSLO Common
Stock represented by book-entry (the " _MSLO Book-Entry Shares_ " and,
together with the Sequential Book-Entry Shares, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
the applicable Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to pursuant
to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ in respect of such Book-Entry Shares,
without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit
of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger
Consideration payable. If any portion of the applicable Merger Consideration
is to be registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose
name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to the registration of such Merger Consideration that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of such registration in the name of a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_ , each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All TopCo
Common Stock to be paid as a portion of the Merger Consideration shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to TopCo Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any shares of
TopCo Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_ , in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, there shall be paid to the holder of shares of TopCo Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
TopCo Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
TopCo Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of TopCo Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Sequential Common Stock and
MSLO Common Stock_. All shares of TopCo Common Stock issued and cash paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE II_  (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Sequential Common
Stock or MSLO Common Stock, as applicable, theretofore represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of
TopCo to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Sequential
or MSLO, as applicable, on such shares of Sequential Common Stock or MSLO
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Sequential Surviving Corporation
of the shares of Sequential Common Stock, or the MSLO Surviving Corporation of
the shares of MSLO Common Stock, that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to TopCo or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_ , except as
otherwise provided by Law.

  



  

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

  



  

(i) No certificates representing fractional shares of TopCo Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of TopCo.

  



    

12 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of MSLO Common Stock converted pursuant to the MSLO Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
TopCo Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of TopCo Common Stock
delivered to the Exchange Agent by TopCo for issuance to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the aggregate number of full
shares of TopCo Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as the " _Excess
Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall
sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on Nasdaq all in the manner
provided herein.

  



  

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on Nasdaq and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the proceeds of any such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. The
Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such proceeds to which each
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account
all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts
to such holders subject to and in accordance with this _Section 2.2(e)_.

  



  

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.2(a)_ (including any interest or other amounts received with
respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for nine months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to TopCo, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_
shall thereafter be entitled to look only to TopCo for payment of their claim
for any shares of TopCo Common Stock, any MSLO Cash Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of TopCo Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to TopCo Common Stock, as applicable.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Sequential, MSLO, TopCo, Singer Merger
Sub, the Sequential Surviving Corporation, Madeline Merger Sub, the MSLO
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to
seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any cash, any shares of TopCo Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, as applicable, of TopCo Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to TopCo Common Stock in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of TopCo, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Sequential, _provided_
, that no losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable to former
holders of shares of MSLO Common Stock pursuant to this  _ARTICLE II_. TopCo
shall replace, as necessary, any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this _Section 2.2(h)_. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to TopCo.

  



  

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of TopCo, Sequential, MSLO, Singer
Merger Sub, the Sequential Surviving Corporation, Madeline Merger Sub,
the MSLO Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any
amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, TopCo shall make all payments of stock (other than payments
treated as compensation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) under this
Agreement free and clear of all deductions and withholdings in respect of
Taxes other than "backup withholding" if required under Section 3406 of the
Code.

  



  

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by TopCo or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such amount as TopCo or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Sequential Common Stock or shares of MSLO Common Stock, as the
case may be, formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of TopCo Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of TopCo Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

2.3 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of MSLO
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Election Deadline (a " _MSLO Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE II_ , to submit an election on or
prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures.

  



  

(a) Each MSLO Holder may specify in a request made in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 2.3_ (an " _Election_ ") (i) the number
of shares of MSLO Common Stock owned by such MSLO Holder with respect to which
such MSLO Holder desires to make a Stock Election, (ii) the number of shares
of MSLO Common Stock owned by such MSLO Holder with respect to which such MSLO
Holder desires to make a Cash Election and (iii) the particular shares for
which the MSLO Holder desires to make either such election, and the order in
which either such election is to apply to any such shares if the election is
subject to proration under _Section 2.4_. Any MSLO Holder who wishes to make
an Election shall be required to waive all dissenters' rights in connection
with making such Election.

  



    

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) TopCo shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to MSLO and
Sequential (the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by TopCo to
record holders of MSLO Common Stock so as to permit those MSLO Holders to
exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(c) TopCo shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as
applicable, the Form of Election to record holders of MSLO Common Stock as
of the record date for the MSLO Stockholders Meeting not less than 20
Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. TopCo shall make
available one or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from
time to time by all persons who become holders of record of MSLO Common Stock
during the period following the record date for the MSLO Stockholders Meeting
and prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received, prior to the Election Deadline, a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by MSLO Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the MSLO Certificates, subject to _Section
2.2(j)_ ) to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or
otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of MSLO or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such MSLO Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an eligible guarantor
institution (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ ,
that such MSLO Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
time required in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of MSLO Book-
Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth
in the Form of Election. Failure to deliver shares of MSLO Common Stock
covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such
guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election,
unless otherwise determined by Sequential, in its sole and absolute
discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise jointly agreed in advance by
Sequential and MSLO, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in
the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located)
on the later of (i) the date immediately prior to the MSLO Stockholders
Meeting and (ii) if on the date immediately prior to the MSLO Stockholders
Meeting, the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ has not been satisfied,
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. MSLO and Sequential shall
issue a joint press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing
the anticipated date of the Election Deadline not more than 15 Business Days
before, and at least five Business Days prior to, the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline. If the Closing is delayed to a subsequent date, the
Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which
shall be three Business Days prior to the Closing Date) and MSLO and
Sequential shall cooperate to promptly publicly announce such rescheduled
Election Deadline.

(e) Any MSLO Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline,
change or revoke such MSLO Holder's Election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of such MSLO Holder's MSLO Certificates, or of the guarantee
of delivery of such MSLO Certificates, or any documents in respect of MSLO
Book-Entry Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an
Election is validly made with respect to any shares of MSLO Common Stock, any
subsequent transfer of such shares of MSLO Common Stock shall automatically
revoke such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt
by the Exchange Agent of written notification from MSLO or Sequential that
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_. The
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election
is not properly made with respect to any shares of MSLO Common Stock (none of
Sequential, MSLO, TopCo, Singer Merger Sub, Madeline Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any such
defect). In the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of MSLO
Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed
to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made
with respect to such shares.

  



  

(f) Sequential and MSLO, in the exercise of their reasonable
discretion, shall have the joint right to make all determinations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the manner and
extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making
the determinations prescribed by _Section 2.4_.

  



  

2.4 Proration.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
the total number of shares of MSLO Common Stock to be converted into the
MSLO Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of
the MSLO Effective Time) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $176,681,757.15 by (y) the MSLO Cash
Consideration. All other shares of MSLO Common Stock (other than
cancelled shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into MSLO Stock
Consideration.

  



  

(b) Within three Business Days after the MSLO Effective Time,
Sequential shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among
the holders of shares of MSLO Common Stock of the rights to receive the MSLO
Cash Consideration and the MSLO Stock Consideration as follows:

  



  

(i) first, with respect to each MSLO Holder who has made a Cash
Election with respect to one-half of the number of shares of such MSLO
Holder's MSLO Common Stock and a Stock Election with respect to one-half of
the number of shares of such MSLO Holder's MSLO Common Stock, all of such
MSLO Holder's Cash Election Shares will be converted into the MSLO Cash
Consideration and all of such MSLO Holder's Stock Election Shares will be
converted into the MSLO Stock Consideration; and

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) then, if the aggregate remaining number of shares of MSLO Common
Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for
this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as
of the MSLO Effective Time but exclude the shares of MSLO Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the MSLO Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)(i)_ ) (the " _Total Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the
Adjusted Cash Conversion Number, then (A) all Stock Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the MSLO
Stock Consideration and (B) Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will
be converted into the right to receive the MSLO Cash Consideration in respect
of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number (with the Exchange
Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.4(a)_ , whether fractions of
Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the MSLO Stock Consideration; or

  



  

(iii) if the Total Cash Election Number is less than the Adjusted Cash
Conversion Number (the amount by which the Adjusted Cash Conversion Number
exceeds the Total Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the "
_Shortfall Number_ "), then all remaining Cash Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the MSLO Cash Consideration, and the Stock
Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be treated in the following
manner:

  



  

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of
Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the MSLO Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares
of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the MSLO Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.4(a)_ , whether
fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the MSLO Stock Consideration; or

  



  

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
Shares, then (1) all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the MSLO Cash Consideration and (2) the Stock Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the MSLO Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Stock Election Shares held
by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election
Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election
Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.4(a)_
, whether fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down),
with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the MSLO Stock Consideration.

2.5 Certain Adjustments. If between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Sequential Common Stock or MSLO
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, dividend payable in stock or other securities or other similar
transaction, the Sequential Merger Consideration and related provisions or
the MSLO Merger Consideration and related provisions, as applicable, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Sequential Common Stock
and MSLO Common Stock or Sequential Equity Awards and MSLO Equity Awards the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange, dividend
or other similar transaction. Nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be construed
to permit Sequential or MSLO to take any action that is otherwise prohibited
or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

2.6 Further Assurances. If, at any time MSLO or Sequential
reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments,
deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Mergers or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at the Effective Time, then MSLO, Sequential, TopCo, the MSLO
Surviving Corporation and the Sequential Surviving Corporation and their
respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Mergers and to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

3.6 MSLO SEC Filings.

  



  

(a) MSLO has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms,
registration statements and other documents required to be filed by MSLO with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since December 31,
2013 (together with any documents furnished during such period by MSLO to the
SEC on a voluntary basis on Current Reports on Form 8-K and any reports,
schedules, forms, registration statements and other documents filed with the
SEC subsequent to the date hereof, collectively, the " _MSLO SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing),
the MSLO SEC Documents complied or, if not yet filed, will comply, in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_
"), as the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and none of the MSLO SEC Documents contained or, if
not yet filed, will contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted or, if not yet filed, will omit a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and
schedules thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the MSLO
SEC Documents (i) have been prepared or, if not yet filed, will be prepared,
in a manner consistent with the books and records of MSLO and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared or, if not yet filed, will be prepared,
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as

periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (iii)
comply or, if not yet filed, will comply, as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv) fairly present or, if
not yet filed, will fairly present, in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of MSLO and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their respective consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments that were not, or are not expected to be, material
in amount), all in accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since January 1, 2014, MSLO has not made
any change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation
of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy
or applicable Law. The books and records of MSLO and its Subsidiaries have

(c) MSLO has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that information relating to MSLO, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in MSLO's periodic and current reports under the
Exchange Act, is made known to MSLO's chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. The chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of MSLO have evaluated the
effectiveness of MSLO's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable MSLO SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation.

  



  

(d) MSLO and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of MSLO's financial
reporting and the preparation of MSLO's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. MSLO has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of MSLO's internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date hereof, to MSLO's auditors and audit committee (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of MSLO's
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect MSLO's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in MSLO's
internal control over financial reporting. A true, correct and complete
summary of any such disclosures made by management to MSLO's auditors and
audit committee is set forth as Section 3.6(d) of the MSLO Disclosure
Schedule.

employee, auditor, accountant or representative of MSLO or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney representing MSLO or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by MSLO or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by MSLO or any of its

agents to the MSLO Board or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) Neither MSLO nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among MSLO
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries in MSLO's or such
Subsidiary's published financial statements or other MSLO SEC Documents.

  



  

(h) MSLO is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the

(j) Except as and to the extent adequately accrued or reserved
against in the audited consolidated balance sheet of MSLO and its
Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2014 (such balance sheet, the " _MSLO Balance
Sheet_ "), neither MSLO nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
obligation of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise,
whether known or unknown and whether or not required by GAAP to be reflected
in a consolidated balance sheet of MSLO and its Subsidiaries or disclosed in
the notes thereto, except for liabilities and obligations, incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date of
the MSLO Balance Sheet, that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a MSLO Material Adverse Effect.

for inclusion in the Form S-4, including the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and

effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty
is made by MSLO with respect to statements made therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Sequential, Madeline Merger Sub, Singer Merger
Sub, TopCo or any of their Affiliates specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will not, at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the
stockholders of MSLO, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that, in each case, no
representation or warranty is made by MSLO with respect to statements made

not misleading, except that, in each case, no representation or warranty is
made by MSLO with respect to statements made therein based on information

consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in Sequential's periodic
and current reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to Sequential's
chief executive officer and its chief financial officer by others within those
entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as required
under the Exchange Act. The chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Sequential have evaluated the effectiveness of Sequential's
disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Sequential SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation.

  



  

(d) Sequential and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules

providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
Sequential's financial reporting and the preparation of Sequential's
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Sequential has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
Sequential's internal control over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, to Sequential's auditors and audit committee (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
Sequential's internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Sequential's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Sequential's internal control over financial reporting. A true, correct and
complete summary of any such disclosures made by management to Sequential's

any Person, and (ii) neither Sequential nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice or claim, including invitations to license, asserting or
suggesting that any such infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution
or unauthorized use is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred,
which, in each case under either (i) or (ii), if determined or resolved
adversely against Sequential or any of its Subsidiaries, would reasonably be
expected to have a Sequential Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
Sequential, no Person is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating
the Intellectual Property owned by Sequential or any of its Subsidiaries,
which infringement would reasonably be expected to have a Sequential Material
Adverse Effect.

complete copies of all Sequential Material Contracts, including any
amendments thereto. Each Sequential Material Contract is a legal, valid,
binding and enforceable agreement of Sequential or its applicable Subsidiary

force and effect. None of Sequential or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of Sequential, any other party is in breach or violation of, or
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) default under, any
Sequential Material Contract, nor has Sequential or any of its
Subsidiaries received any claim of any such breach, violation or default,
except for such breaches and defaults which would not, individually or in the

4.18 Financing.

  



  

(a) Sequential has delivered to MSLO a true, complete and correct
copy of the executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof
between Sequential and GSO Capital Partners, LP (such commitment letter and
all fee letters associated therewith, in each case as amended or otherwise
modified only to the extent permitted by this Agreement, collectively, "
_Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend
the aggregate principal amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
and expenses (the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, (a) the Financing
Commitments have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified, (b) no
amendment, restatement or other modification to the Financing Commitments is
contemplated and (c) the respective commitments contained in the Financing
Commitments have not been reduced, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect and, to Sequential's knowledge, no reduction, withdrawal, termination
or rescission is contemplated. Except for the fee letter referenced in the
Financing Commitments (a true, complete and correct copy of which has been
provided to MSLO, with only fee amounts and certain economic terms of the
market flex agreed to by the parties redacted, none of which redacted
provisions will adversely affect the availability of, or impose conditions on
the availability of, the full amount of the Financing at Closing), there are
no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the
funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments delivered to MSLO on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Sequential, and to the knowledge
of Sequential, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies (including pursuant to any "market
flex" provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, (i) Sequential is not in
default or breach under the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments
and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Sequential or, to
the knowledge of Sequential, any other party thereto, under the terms and
conditions of the Financing Commitments and (ii) Sequential has not received
any written notice of such default or event. All commitment and other fees
required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof under the Financing
Commitments have been paid and, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to Sequential's obligations in _Section 7.1_ and _7.3_
hereunder, Sequential does not have any reason to believe that it will not be
able to satisfy any term or condition of closing of the Financing that is
required to be satisfied as a condition to availability of the Financing or
that the full amount of the Financing will not be made available to
Sequential on the Closing Date and, as of the date hereof, Sequential is not
aware of the existence of any facts or events that would reasonably be
expected to cause such conditions to the Financing not to be satisfied or the
full amount of the Financing not to be available. The aggregate proceeds
contemplated to be provided under the Financing Commitments, together with
Sequential's existing resources, in the aggregate, will be sufficient to make
all required payments in connection with the MSLO Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of the MSLO Cash
Consideration, any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled,
terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the
Mergers (including all indebtedness of MSLO and its Subsidiaries required to
be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or
discharged in connection therewith) and all other amounts to be paid pursuant
to this Agreement and associated fees, costs and expenses of the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, on the
Closing Date. Sequential affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or
any of its other obligations under this Agreement that it obtain financing
for, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

premiums with respect thereto have been paid to the extent due. Sequential
has not received notice of, nor to the knowledge of Sequential is there
threatened in writing, any cancellation, termination, reduction of coverage
or material premium increases with respect to any such policy. All material
insurable risks in respect of the business and assets of Sequential and its
Subsidiaries are covered by such insurance policies and the types and amounts
of coverage provided therein are usual and customary in the context of the
business and operations in which Sequential and its Subsidiaries are engaged.
The activities and operations of Sequential and its Subsidiaries have
been conducted in a manner so as to conform in all material respects to all
applicable provisions of such insurance policies. The consummation of the

Agreement will give MSLO, directly or indirectly, the right to control
Sequential or any of the Sequential Subsidiaries or direct the business or

right to control MSLO or any of the MSLO Subsidiaries or direct the business
or operations of MSLO or any of the MSLO Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of MSLO and Sequential will exercise,

actions, rights or restrictions set forth herein, will be interpreted in such
a way as to place Sequential or MSLO in violation of any applicable Law.

  



  

5.5 No Solicitation; Recommendation of the Merger.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th calendar day
after the date of this Agreement (the " _No Shop Period Start Date_ "), MSLO
and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_
") shall have the right to (i) initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal,
including by providing information (including non-public information and data)
regarding, and affording access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records and personnel of, MSLO and its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that MSLO shall promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) make available to Sequential any non-
public information provided to any such Person or Persons or Representatives
(other than immaterial information) that was not previously provided to
Sequential, and (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Persons or groups of Persons with
respect to any Acquisitions Proposals and cooperate with or assist or
participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or
negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals. No
later than 48 hours after the No Shop Period Start Date, MSLO shall notify
Sequential in writing of the identity of any Person that submitted any
Acquisition Proposal prior to the No Shop Period Start Date, and shall provide
to Sequential a copy of such Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 5.5(b)_ , from
and after the No Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE
VIII_ , MSLO shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representative of MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect
to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the
foregoing. Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 5.5(b)_ (including
with respect to any Excluded Party as provided in the last sentence hereof),
as of the No Shop Period Start Date, MSLO shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives of MSLO and its Subsidiaries to, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and (B) request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the No Shop
Period Start Date and prior to the time the MSLO Stockholder Approval is
obtained, (1) MSLO receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any Person
that the MSLO Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.5_, (3)
the MSLO Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (4) the MSLO
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that
the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) below would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of MSLO under applicable Law, then MSLO may (x) furnish
information regarding, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records and personnel of, MSLO and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and to the Representatives of such
Person or Persons pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to MSLO than those set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement (any such confidentiality agreement, an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to any such Person or Persons or Representatives (other
than immaterial information) that was not previously provided to Sequential
shall be promptly provided to Sequential and (y) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the passage of the No
Shop Period Start Date, until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the 45th
calendar day after the date of this Agreement (provided such date and time
shall be extended to the extent and during such period thereafter as MSLO is
in active discussions with an Excluded Party), MSLO may continue to engage in
the activities described in _Section 5.5(a)_ with respect to any Excluded
Party, including with respect to any amended or modified Acquisition Proposal
submitted by any Excluded Party following the No Shop Period Start Date, and
the restrictions in this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall not apply with respect
thereto.

  



    

57

--- 

    



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.5(d)_ , neither the MSLO Board
nor any committee thereof shall:

  



  

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Sequential) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the MSLO
Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the MSLO Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend or otherwise declare
advisable the approval by MSLO stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or
(C) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action set
forth in this _Section 5.5(c)(i)_ being referred to herein as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

  



  

(ii) authorize, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal or cause or
permit MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other Contract (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or resolve, agree or propose to take
any such actions.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to the time the MSLO Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
MSLO Board (at the recommendation of the Special Committee) may, (x) effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change if the MSLO Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, either in response to a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event or (y) solely in response to a Superior
Proposal received after the date hereof that was unsolicited and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 5.5_, cause MSLO to enter
into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto and
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ ; _provided_ , _however_
, that the MSLO Board may only effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i) _if (and in no other
circumstances may the MSLO Board effect an Adverse Recommendation Change):

  



  

(i) MSLO notifies Sequential in writing at least three Business Days
in advance that it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ , which notice shall
specify the basis for the Adverse Recommendation Change or termination and,
in the case of a Superior Proposal, specifies the terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Person making, such Superior Proposal, and
contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any) of the proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Superior Proposal or material change in the
facts or circumstances relating to an Intervening Event shall require a new
written notice by MSLO and a new three Business Day period);

  



    

58 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(i)_ , if Sequential makes a proposal during such the three
Business Day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
MSLO shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
with Sequential in good faith (to the extent Sequential seeks to negotiate)
to make any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as would permit the MSLO Board not to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_
; and

  



  

(iii) the MSLO Board shall have considered in good faith any changes
to this Agreement offered in writing by Sequential no later than 11:59 p.m.,
New York City time, on the third Business Day of such three Business Day
period and shall have determined (x) in the event the MSLO Board's
determination pursuant to subparagraph (c) above is in response to a Superior
Proposal, that such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Sequential were to be given
effect or (y) in the event the MSLO Board's determination pursuant to
subparagraph (c) above is in response to an Intervening Event, that such
changes would not affect the MSLO Board's determination of the need for an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the terms and conditions of this _Section 5.5(d)_
shall apply both prior to and following the No Shop Period Start Date,
including with respect to any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded
Party.

  



  

(e) Following the No Shop Period Start Date, MSLO promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours of receipt) shall advise Sequential, orally or in
writing, in the event MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives
receives (i) any indication by any Person that it is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal (including any request by any Person to waive any
standstill or similar provision applicable to such Person), (ii) any inquiry
or request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably
likely to lead to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any
proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case together with a description of the material terms and
conditions of and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request,
proposal or offer, the identity of the Person making any such indication,
inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal,
offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. MSLO (or its
outside counsel) shall, orally or in writing, keep Sequential (or its outside
counsel) reasonably informed on a timely basis (and in any event within 48
hours) with respect to any change to price or other material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal. MSLO (or its outside counsel) shall, promptly upon
receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within 48 hours), provide
Sequential (or its outside counsel) with copies of material agreements
comprising such Acquisition Proposal and any amendments thereto. Without
limiting any of the foregoing, MSLO shall promptly (and in any event within
48 hours) notify Sequential, orally or in writing, if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this _Section 5.5_.

  



  

(f) MSLO agrees that any material violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.5_ by any Representative of MSLO or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement by
MSLO.

  



    

59

(g) Nothing contained in _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit MSLO, the
MSLO Board or any other committee of the MSLO Board from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and
listen" communication to the stockholders of MSLO pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that neither the MSLO Board nor any
committee thereof shall effect an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
applicable requirements of _Section 5.5_ shall have been satisfied.

combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or
otherwise, of (A) assets or businesses of MSLO and its Subsidiaries that
generate 20% or more of the net revenues or net income or that represent 20%
or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of MSLO and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (B)
20% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding MSLO Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, including any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning
twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding
MSLO Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, in each case other than
the MSLO Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means a Person or group of Persons from
whom MSLO or any of its Representatives has received, after the execution of
this Agreement and prior to the No Shop Period Start Date, a bona fide written

constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance
that was not known to the MSLO Board prior to the execution of this
Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known or

receipt of MSLO Stockholder Approval; provided, that in no event shall the
receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating
thereto or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event; and

  



  

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide binding written
Acquisition Proposal that the MSLO Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, including the financing terms
thereof, is (A) more favorable to the stockholders of MSLO from a financial
point of view than the MSLO Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed
by Sequential in response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely to be
completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term "Acquisition
Proposal" to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

5.6 Directors. Prior to the Effective Time, MSLO shall cause each
member of the MSLO Board, other than any persons designated by Sequential at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to execute and deliver a
letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the MSLO Board
effective as of the Effective Time.

  



  

5.7 Financing.

  



  

(a) Sequential shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (including the
exercise of "market flex" provisions in the related fee letter) as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof (taking into account the expected
timing of the Closing). Sequential shall comply with its obligations, and
enforce its rights, under the Financing Commitments in a timely and diligent
manner. In the event that all conditions to the Financing Commitments set
forth therein have been, or upon funding will be, satisfied, Sequential shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders party thereto and the
other Persons providing such Financing to comply with their obligations under
the Financing Commitments and the definitive financing agreements entered
into in connection with the Financing and to fund the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees, costs and expenses on or prior to the Closing Date. Sequential will
keep MSLO reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including (A) promptly
notifying MSLO of (1) any material breach or default by any party to the
Financing Commitments or any definitive financing agreement entered into in
connection with the Financing, if such breach or default would reasonably be
expected to affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, the
Financing and (2) the receipt by any of Sequential or any of its
Representatives of any written notice or other written communication from any
lender committing or providing the Financing or other Person with respect to
(x) any actual, threatened or alleged breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments or any definitive
financing agreement entered into in connection with the Financing or any
provision thereof (including any proposal by any lender or other Person to
withdraw or terminate or make any material change in the terms of the
Financing Commitment that would reasonably be expected to affect the timely
availability of, or the amount of, the Financing) or (y) any material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Commitment or any definitive financing agreement entered into in connection
with the Financing, if such dispute or disagreement would reasonably be
expected to affect the timely availability of, or amount of, the Financing
and (B) upon MSLO's reasonable request, advising and updating MSLO, in a
reasonable level of detail, with respect to status of the Financing.
Sequential may replace or amend all or any portion of the Financing
Commitments; provided, that such replacement or amendment would not (i)
reduce the aggregate cash amount of proceeds of the Financing (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Financing (except as set forth in any "market flex" provisions existing on
the date hereof in the related fee letter)), (ii) impose new or additional
conditions, or otherwise expand any conditions, to the receipt of the
Financing from those set forth in the Financing Commitments on the date
hereof, (iii) reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially delay or
impair, the availability of the full amount of the Financing or make the
funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing less likely to occur, (iv) adversely affect the ability of
Sequential to enforce its rights against any lender or any other Person
providing or committing to provide the Financing or (v) adversely impact the
ability of Sequential to cause TopCo to timely consummate the MSLO Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement,
references to "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments as replaced, amended or modified as permitted hereby,
including, if applicable, pursuant to an alternative financing that is in
compliance herewith, and references to "Financing Commitments" shall
include such documents as replaced, amended or modified as permitted hereby,
including, if applicable, pursuant to an alternative financing in compliance
herewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to
replacements or amendments permitted hereby, Sequential shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments
until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of
the Closing) all conditions and covenants applicable to Sequential in the
Financing Commitments and any definitive agreements entered into in
connection therewith at or prior to Closing and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions consistent with those
contemplated by the Financing Commitments and (iv) consummate the Financing
at or prior to the Closing. If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best
efforts by Sequential to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.7_ ,
any portion of the Financing or the Financing Commitments (or any definitive
financing agreement relating thereto) expire or are terminated or otherwise
become unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for whatever
reason, Sequential shall (i) promptly notify MSLO of such expiration,
termination or unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees, costs
and expenses as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event
and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such
alternative financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in
the Financing Commitments. True, complete and correct copies of each
commitment letter and other agreement relating to the alternative
financing will be promptly provided to MSLO. Sequential acknowledges and
agrees that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing has not been obtained, Sequential
will continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ , to complete the Mergers and
consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Prior to the Closing, MSLO shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide to Sequential, at Sequential's sole expense, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Sequential in connection with the
Financing, including by using reasonable best efforts in (i)
furnishing Sequential and its lenders any information and financial
statements reasonably requested by such Persons as is customarily required in
connection with the execution of debt financings similar to the Financing (
_provided,_ that MSLO will have no obligation to prepare pro forma financial
information or post-closing financial information), (ii) participating, but
only together with the executive officers of Sequential and other members of
senior management and representatives of Sequential, and at a time and place
acceptable to the executive officers of MSLO, in a reasonable number of

lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Financing and the executive officers of MSLO and other members of senior
management and representatives of MSLO), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Financing, as reasonably requested by Sequential, (iii) assisting Sequential

lenders, during normal working hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to
allow them to conduct audit examinations and appraisals with respect to such
collateral, (vi) seeking to cause its auditors to provide assistance
to Sequential consistent with their customary practice (including to provide
and consent to the use of their audit reports relating to the consolidated
financial statements of MSLO and its Subsidiaries), in each case on customary
terms and consistent with their customary practice in connection with
financings similar to the Financing, (vii) so long as such documents and other
information are reasonably requested by Sequential in writing at least ten
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and
other information required by regulatory authorities with respect to MSLO and
its Subsidiaries under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended, and (viii) seeking to arrange for customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing
providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of
all indebtedness contemplated by the Financing Commitment to be paid off,

irrespective of the above, (A) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or the ongoing operations of MSLO and
its Subsidiaries, (B) nothing in this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall require
cooperation to the extent that it would (x) cause any condition to the
Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ to not be satisfied or otherwise
cause any breach of this Agreement or (y) reasonably be expected to conflict
with or violate MSLO's or any its Subsidiaries' organizational documents or
any applicable Law, (C) prior to the Closing, none of the directors or
managers of MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries, acting in such capacity, shall
be required to execute, deliver or enter into or perform any agreement,

any resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Financing is obtained, and (D) none of MSLO's or its
Subsidiaries' officers or employees shall be required to execute, deliver or
enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument with respect to

its Subsidiaries shall be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment in connection
or incur or assume any other liability or obligation with the Financing prior
to the Effective Time except in the case of expenses that are reimbursed as
provided in _Section 8.2(b)_. Sequential shall, promptly upon request,
reimburse MSLO for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by MSLO or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with fulfilling its obligations pursuant to
_Section 5.7(b)_. Sequential shall indemnify and hold harmless MSLO and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information relating to MSLO or its
Subsidiaries provided by MSLO in writing specifically for use in
the Financing offering documents). MSLO hereby consents to the use of its and
its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably
likely to harm or disparage MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation
or goodwill of MSLO or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

  



  

5.8 Termination of Certain Agreements. Except for any agreements or
arrangements set forth in Section 5.8 of the Sequential Disclosure Schedule

and Information Statement. Each of Sequential and MSLO shall use reasonable
best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of Sequential and MSLO
shall furnish all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to
the other, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested,
in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4,
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Information Statement. The Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include all information reasonably requested by
such other party to be included therein. Each of Sequential and MSLO shall

any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC,
on the other hand. Each of Sequential and MSLO shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of Sequential and MSLO (i) shall provide the other an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii) shall include
in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other.
Each of Sequential and MSLO shall advise the other, promptly after receipt of
notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of

shares of TopCo Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and

state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder
in connection with the Mergers, the issuance of the Merger Consideration and
the issuance of shares of TopCo Common Stock under the Sequential Benefit
Plans. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Sequential, MSLO, TopCo, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Sequential, MSLO or TopCo that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the

obtaining the MSLO Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum,
(iii) with the consent of Sequential or (iv) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that MSLO has determined after consultation with outside legal
counsel is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
stockholders of MSLO prior to the MSLO Stockholders Meeting. MSLO shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to MSLO's stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act and to hold the MSLO
Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 becomes
effective and (ii) subject to the provisions of _Section 5.5_ , solicit the
MSLO Stockholder Approval. MSLO shall, through the MSLO Board, recommend to
its stockholders that they vote in favor of the MSLO Merger and shall include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, except to the extent
that the MSLO Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section 5.5_. MSLO agrees, subject to _Section 5.5_ , that its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall not be affected by the

6.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable Law, each of Sequential and MSLO shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other and its representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Closing Date to all of the properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, each of Sequential and MSLO
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
the other and its representatives such information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request, other

_Section 5.5_ , in which case, the provisions of _Section 5.5_ shall apply to
the sharing of such information. The foregoing notwithstanding, neither
Sequential nor MSLO shall be required to afford such access if and to the
extent it would (w) unreasonably disrupt its operations or any of its
Subsidiaries, (x) violate any of its or its Subsidiaries' obligations with
respect to confidentiality, (y) cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade
secret protection to it or any of its Subsidiaries or (z) constitute a
violation of any applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case,
Sequential or MSLO, as the case may be, uses commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize the effects of such restriction or to provide a reasonable
alternative to such access. All information furnished pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
April 27, 2015, between MSLO and Sequential (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.2 _or
information provided to, made available to or delivered by either Sequential
or MSLO pursuant to this _Section 6.2 _or otherwise shall affect any
representations or warranties, conditions or rights of either Sequential or
MSLO contained in this Agreement.

of Sequential, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for
any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract. In furtherance and not in

that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the

Agreement.

  



  

6.4 Indemnification and Insurance.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, TopCo shall indemnify and
hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of MSLO or
Sequential or any of their respective Subsidiaries or who is as of the date
of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of MSLO or Sequential, as applicable, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person
(including such individual's affiliates, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party (or such Indemnified Party's affiliate) is or was an
officer or director of MSLO or Sequential, as applicable, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is or was serving at the request of MSLO or
Sequential, as applicable, or any of their respective subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person or in respect of any acts or omissions
in their capacities as such directors or officers occurring prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (i) each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from TopCo to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that any person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification, and (ii) TopCo shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In
the event that TopCo, the Sequential Surviving Corporation or the MSLO
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, TopCo, the Sequential
Surviving Corporation and/or the MSLO Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
TopCo, the Sequential Surviving Corporation and/or the MSLO Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section

TopCo shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by MSLO or Sequential or any of their Subsidiaries or provide
substitute polices of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in
no event shall TopCo be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies (or substitute insurance policies) (i) of MSLO in respect of any one
policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by MSLO for such
insurance for the year ending December 31, 2014 (the " _MSLO Maximum Amount_
"), and if TopCo is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section
6.4(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years
within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the MSLO Maximum
Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period; _provided_ , that
in lieu of the foregoing, MSLO may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a
six-year "tail" policy under MSLO's existing directors and officers insurance
policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding
sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount
that, on an annual basis, does not exceed the MSLO Maximum Amount, or (ii) of
Sequential in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the annual
premium payable by Sequential for such insurance for the year ending December
31, 2014 (the " _Sequential Maximum Amount_ "), and if TopCo is unable to
obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.4(b)_ , it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year
period for an annual premium equal to the Sequential Maximum Amount, in
respect of each policy year within such period; _provided_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing, Sequential may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" policy under Sequential's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, on an annual basis, does not exceed the Sequential Maximum
Amount.

consummation of the Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and

indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.

action to deliver, immediately following (and in any event within one hour,
and prior to any public announcement, of) the execution of this Agreement, to

statements that are substantially similar to previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by MSLO and Sequential in compliance

action to cause any "moratorium," "fair price," "interested shareholder,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or similar provision of
any state anti-takeover Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") to become
applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

reasonable discretion.

6.11 Employees and Employee Benefits.

  



  

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing
thereafter for 12 months, subject to any contractual obligations that
may apply, TopCo shall provide, or shall cause MSLO Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to provide, employees of MSLO as of the Closing who continue
employment with TopCo or any of its Subsidiaries, including MSLO Surviving
Corporation, following the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i)
wage or base salary levels (but not any short-term incentive compensation
opportunities or other bonus plans (other than the commission sales plan set
forth in Section 6.11(a) of the MSLO Disclosure Schedule)) that are not less
than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that are comparable
in the aggregate to either those in effect for such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or those provided to
similarly-situated employees of Sequential from time-to-time, _provided _
that, (x) until December 31, 2015, Topco and the MSLO Surviving Corporation
agree to keep in effect all employee benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) that are applicable to employees of MSLO as of the date hereof
and (y) notwithstanding the immediately preceding clause (x), until the one
year anniversary of the Closing Date, TopCo and the MSLO Surviving
Corporation agree to keep in effect all severance plans, practices and
policies that are applicable to employees of MSLO as of the date hereof and
set forth on Section 6.11(a) of the MSLO Disclosure Schedule. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit the right of TopCo or any of their respective
Affiliates to (A) terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any
time, (B) change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for any
Continuing Employee, or (C) change or modify any Sequential Benefit Plan, MSLO

its terms.

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by TopCo and its respective Affiliates
in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing
(the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited
with the same amount of service as was credited by MSLO as of the Closing
under similar or comparable MSLO Benefit Plans in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing (except (i)
for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit plans and retiree
medical arrangements or (ii) to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing,
each Continuing Employee will immediately be eligible to participate in such
New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage
under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable
MSLO Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to
participate immediately before such commencement of participation and (ii) for
purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, TopCo shall cause all
preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements
were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable MSLO Benefit
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing. TopCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the MSLO Benefit Plan
ending on the date such Continuing Employee's participation in

ARTICLE VIII 
 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

  



  

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the board of directors
of the terminating party or parties:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of MSLO and Sequential;

  



  

(b) by either MSLO or Sequential, if any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable
Order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that no party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ if such party's
breach of its obligations under this Agreement proximately contributed to the
occurrence of such Order;

  



  

(c) by either MSLO or Sequential , if the Mergers shall not have
been consummated on or before December 22, 2015, subject to extension by the
mutual agreement of MSLO and Sequential (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(c)_ if such party's breach of its obligations under
this Agreement was the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur
by the End Date;

  



  

(d) by either MSLO or Sequential, if the MSLO Stockholder Approval
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
vote at a MSLO Stockholders Meeting duly convened thereof or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

  



  

(e) by MSLO if the Sequential Written Consent shall not have been
delivered to Sequential in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and to
MSLO within 24 hours after execution of this Agreement;

  



  

(f) by MSLO, if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any inaccuracy of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Sequential, which breach
or inaccuracy, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.2(a) _or _(b)_ , unless such failure is reasonably
capable of being cured, and Sequential is continuing to use its
reasonable best efforts to cure such failure, by the End Date;

  



    

73 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(g) by Sequential, if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any inaccuracy of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of MSLO, which breach or
inaccuracy, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.3(a) _or _(b)_ , unless such failure is reasonably
capable of being cured, and MSLO is continuing to use its reasonable
best efforts to cure such failure, by the End Date;

  



  

(h) by Sequential if (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
occurred, (B) prior to the MSLO Stockholders Meeting, following the receipt
by MSLO of an Acquisition Proposal or amendment thereto, the MSLO Board shall
have failed to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the MSLO Merger within
10 Business Days after the date Sequential requests in writing that the MSLO
Board so reaffirm the recommendation, or (C) MSLO shall have intentionally
and materially breached its obligations set forth in _Section 5.5_ or _6.1_ ;
or

  



  

(i) by MSLO at any time prior to obtaining the MSLO Stockholder
Approval, in order to accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with
_Section 5.5(d)_ ; _provided_ , that MSLO shall have (A) simultaneously with
such termination entered into the associated Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and (B) paid any amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_.

  



  

8.2 Effect of Termination.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either MSLO or
Sequential in accordance with _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, and none of MSLO, Sequential, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of the officers or directors of
any of the foregoing shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under
this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that _Section 3.21_, _Section 4.22_ , this _Section 8.2_
and _ARTICLE IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.2_ , no party will be
relieved or released from any liability or damages arising from an
intentional and material breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to
such termination, and in each case the aggrieved party will be entitled to
all rights and remedies available at Law or in equity (which the parties
acknowledge and agree will not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs). Without limiting the foregoing, MSLO acknowledges and
agrees that the payment of the Expense Reimbursement or Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_ , respectively, will not
preclude Sequential, in the case of an intentional and material breach of this
Agreement by MSLO or fraud, from seeking additional damages from MSLO on
account of such intentional and material breach or fraud (it being understood
that the MSLO Board's failure to reaffirm its recommendation under the
circumstances set forth in _Section 8.1(h)(B)_ will not be deemed an
intentional and material breach of this Agreement if the MSLO Board has
determined the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law). For purposes
of this Agreement, "intentional and material breach" means a material breach
that is a consequence of an act (or failure to act) undertaken by the
breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking
of (or the failure to take) such act would, or would be reasonably
expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

  



    

74 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) In the event that Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ or _(g)_ , MSLO shall promptly, and in any event within two Business
Days after termination of this Agreement, reimburse Sequential for any and all
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in an amount
not to exceed $2,500,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ").

  



  

(c) In the event that:

  



  

(i) (A) after the date of this Agreement but prior to the date of
the MSLO Stockholders Meeting, any Person or group of Persons shall have
publicly made an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional), (B) this
Agreement is terminated by MSLO or Sequential pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_
or _(d)_ or by Sequential pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ and (C) within 12
months after the date of such termination, MSLO enters into an agreement in
respect of any Acquisition Proposal, or recommends or submits an Acquisition
Proposal to its stockholders for adoption, and such Acquisition Proposal is
later consummated, which, in each case, need not be the same Acquisition
Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to termination hereof,
_provided_  that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ the references to
"20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%";

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Sequential pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_ ; or

  



  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by MSLO pursuant to _Section
8.1(i)_;

  



  

then, in any such event, MSLO shall pay to Sequential the applicable
Termination Fee (less the amount of any Expense Reimbursement previously paid
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_), it being understood that in no event shall
MSLO be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Payment
of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated by Sequential (A) no later than
three Business Days after the date on which MSLO consummates such Acquisition
Proposal in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
8.2(c)(i)_ , (B) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and,
in any event, within three Business Days thereof) in the case of a
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ , and (C)
simultaneously with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, termination,
in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(iii)_.

  



  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and (ii) the
Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such fee becomes payable,
constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty.

  



    

75 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

8.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by MSLO and Sequential, by action taken or authorized
by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after the
Sequential Stockholder Approval or the MSLO Stockholder Approval is obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Sequential Stockholder Approval and/or
MSLO Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without
further approval of the stockholders of Sequential or stockholders of MSLO, as
applicable, any amendment of this Agreement which by applicable Law otherwise
requires the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither
this _Section 8.3 _nor _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.10_, _Section 9.12 _or
_Section 9.13_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would
modify the substance of such Sections) may be amended, supplemented, modified
or waived in a manner that is adverse to the interests of the lenders party
to the Financing Commitment in any respect without the written consent of
such lenders.

  



  

8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, MSLO
and Sequential may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed by an authorized officer on behalf of such party,
but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with
an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

9.1 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time, other than those covenants or agreements of the parties which
by their terms apply, or are to be performed in whole or in part, after the

by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,

Sequential shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses (other than
the fees and expenses of each party's attorneys and accountants, which shall
be borne by the party incurring such expenses) incurred by the parties hereto
in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the

9.11 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware; _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a
remedy of specific performance on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party further
agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.11_,

in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such legal action
or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice
as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for
any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party
hereto hereby (v) agrees that it will not bring or support any action, clause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the lenders party to the Financing Commitment and any
other Person providing Financing in any way relating to this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including without limitation any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), (w) submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (x)
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered
mail addressed to it at its address provided in _Section 9.3 _shall be
effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any
such court, (y) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (z) agrees that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by
counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
