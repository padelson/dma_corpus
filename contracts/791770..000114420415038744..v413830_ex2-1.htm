Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of the
applicable Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such registration
in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section 2.2(b)</U>,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration.</P>

Sequential and GSO Capital Partners, LP (such commitment letter and all fee letters associated therewith, in each case as amended
or otherwise modified only to the extent permitted by this Agreement, collectively, &ldquo;<U>Financing Commitments</U>&rdquo;),
pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the
aggregate principal amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

is contemplated and (c) the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been reduced, withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded in any respect and, to Sequential&rsquo;s knowledge, no reduction, withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated.
Except for the fee letter referenced in the Financing Commitments (a true, complete and correct copy of which has been provided
to MSLO, with only fee amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex agreed to by the parties redacted, none of which
redacted provisions will adversely affect the availability of, or impose conditions on the availability of, the full amount of
the Financing at Closing), there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the funding of
the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to MSLO on or prior to the date hereof.
As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Sequential, and to the knowledge of Sequential, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors&rsquo;
rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (including pursuant to any &ldquo;market flex&rdquo; provisions in the related
fee letter or otherwise) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, (i) Sequential is not in default or breach under the terms and conditions of the
Financing Commitments and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
or breach on the part of Sequential or, to the knowledge of Sequential, any other party thereto, under the terms and conditions
of the Financing Commitments and (ii)&nbsp;Sequential has not received any written notice of such default or event. All commitment
and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof under the Financing Commitments have been paid and, assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Sequential&rsquo;s obligations in <U>Section 7.1</U> and <U>7.3</U> hereunder,
Sequential does not have any reason to believe that it will not be able to satisfy any term or condition of closing of the Financing
that is required to be satisfied as a condition to availability of the Financing or that the full amount of the Financing will
not be made available to Sequential on the Closing Date and, as of the date hereof, Sequential is not aware of the existence of
any facts or events that would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to the Financing not to be satisfied or the full
amount of the Financing not to be available. The aggregate proceeds contemplated to be provided under the Financing Commitments,
together with Sequential&rsquo;s existing resources, in the aggregate, will be sufficient to make all required payments in connection
with the MSLO Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of the MSLO Cash Consideration, any debt
required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Mergers
(including all indebtedness of MSLO and its Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise
satisfied or discharged in connection therewith) and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated fees,
costs and expenses of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, on the Closing Date.
Sequential affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that it obtain
financing for, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</P>

into in connection therewith at or prior to Closing and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions consistent with those contemplated by the Financing
Commitments and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts
by Sequential to satisfy its obligations under this <U>Section 5.7</U>, any portion of the Financing or the Financing Commitments

Commitments. True, complete and correct copies of each commitment letter and other agreement relating to the alternative financing
