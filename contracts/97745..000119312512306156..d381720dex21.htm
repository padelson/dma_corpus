herein, the Transaction Representative (as defined below). Buyer, Buyer Sub,
the Company and, where applicable, the Transaction Representative, are
sometimes individually referred to as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_."

_RECITALS_

 

A. Each Partys Board of Directors has determined that it is advisable and in
the best interests of such Partys equity holders to consummate, and has
approved, the business combination transactions provided for herein in which
Buyer Sub would merge with and into the Company, the Company would become a

B. The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with the Merger (as defined below) and also to
prescribe various conditions to the merger.

 

C. Concurrently herewith, (i) certain principal shareholders of the Company
are entering into voting agreements with the Company and Buyer, pursuant to
which, among other matters, such shareholders are agreeing to vote in favor of
the Merger, to be bound by certain provisions of this Agreement (including,
where relevant, in their capacities as SEU Holders (as defined below))
and (but only in the case of certain of such principal shareholders) refrain
from competing with the Company, all on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, and (ii) the other shareholders, and the
optionholders, of the Company are entering into joinder agreements with the
Company and Buyer, pursuant to which, among other matters, such
securityholders are agreeing to be bound by certain provisions of this
Agreement, all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound

Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer for Buyers review and approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld) a certificate (the " _Allocation Schedule_
"), executed by an authorized officer of the Company, certifying (i) the

2.4(a)_ and to each SEU Holder pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ and (ii) each
Shareholders and SEU Holders Proportionate Share.

2.5 _Earn-out Consideration_. The Shareholders and SEU Holders shall be
entitled to additional consideration as follows:

(a) If the Company Business Unit Revenue for the Earn-Out Period (the "
_Earn-out Period Revenue_ ") is more than five percent (5%) greater than the
Company Business Unit Revenue for the prior one (1) year period (the " _Base
Period Revenue_ "), then each Shareholder and SEU Holder shall be entitled to
receive his or her Proportionate Share of $833,333.33 for every one tenth of
one percent (.1%) by which the Earn-out Period Revenue exceeds the Base Period
Revenue. In no event shall the consideration payable pursuant to
the preceding sentence exceed an aggregate of Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000). The consideration, if any, payable pursuant to this Section 2.5
is referred to as the " _Earn-out Consideration_."

 

(b) As soon as practicable after completion of the Earn-out Period, and in any
event no later than ninety (90) days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) and deliver to the Transaction Representative (i) a
calculation of the Earn-Out Period Revenue, (ii) a calculation of the Base
Period Revenue, (iii) relevant backup schedules reasonably sufficient to
allow review of Buyers calculation of the Earn-out Period Revenue and the
Base Period Revenue, and (iv) a statement of the amount, if any, of the Earn-
out Consideration to be delivered to the Shareholders and the SEU Holders;
and concurrent with such deliveries, Buyer shall (A) pay ninety-two and one
half percent (92.5%) of the Earn-out Consideration, if any, as shown on such
statement to Buyers paying agent, with instructions to pay such amount to
the Shareholders and the SEU Holders in accordance with their respective
Proportionate Shares, and (B) deposit seven and one half percent (7.5%) of the
Earn-out Consideration, if any, as shown on such statement with the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Unless the Transaction
Representative shall, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c)
below, challenge Buyers determination of the Earn-out Period Revenue, the
Base Period Revenue and/or the Earn-out Consideration within 30 days after
the delivery of Buyers calculation thereof, Buyers determination shall be
binding upon the Shareholders, the SEU Holders and the Transaction
Representative. The Transaction Representative shall be granted reasonable
access during business hours to the books, records and accounting work papers
of the Company to conduct its review of such the Earn-out Period Revenue and
the Base Period Revenue. Such access shall be at such times and in such a
manner as shall not unreasonably interfere with Buyers operation of the
Companys business.

 

(c) In the event that the Transaction Representative disputes the calculation
of the Earn-out Period Revenue, the Base Period Revenue and/or the Earn-out
Consideration, the Transaction Representative shall notify Buyer in writing by
delivery of a notice (an " _Earn-out Dispute Notice_ ") within 30 calendar
days after delivery of Buyers calculation of the Earn-out Period Revenue,
the Base Period Revenue and/or the Earn-out Consideration, which Earn-out
Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute. In the event of such a dispute, Buyer and the
Transaction Representative shall act in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Earn-out Consideration. If
Buyer and

 



-7-   the Transaction Representative are unable to resolve the dispute within 30
calendar days after delivery of the Earn-out Dispute Notice, then any
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator
for final and binding resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Section 3.3(b)_, mutatis mutandis. For avoidance of doubt, any dispute as
to _Section 2.5(e)_ shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 12.15_.

(d) Within 14 days of the resolution of any dispute or the Transaction
Representatives failure to deliver an Earn-out Dispute Notice on a timely
basis, Buyer shall (i) pay ninety-two and one half percent (92.5%) of the
Earn-out Consideration, if any, to Buyers paying agent (to the extent in
excess of the amount, if any, paid pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_), with
instructions to pay such amount to the Shareholders and the SEU Holders in
accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares, and (ii) deposit
seven and one half percent (7.5%) of the Earn-out Consideration, if any, with
the Escrow Agent (to the extent in excess of the amount, if any, paid pursuant
to _Section 2.5(b)_) pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 

(e) By their adoption of this Agreement, the Shareholders and the SEU Holders
agree and acknowledge that Buyer may make from time to time such business
decisions as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, in the conduct of
the business of the Company following Closing. The Shareholders and the SEU
Holders will have no right to claim any lost earn-out or other damages as a
result of such decisions so long as the actions were not taken by Buyer for
the principal purpose of decreasing the amounts payable under this _Section
2.5_. From the Closing Date until the conclusion of the Earn-out
Period, Buyer shall not (and, where applicable, shall cause the Company not
to) sell or liquidate or otherwise dispose of (i) the Company or (ii) all or
substantially all of the Companys assets (including any then held outside the
Company within the Company Business Unit), in each case to an unaffiliated
third party, unless Buyer arranges for the successor, transferee or assignee,
if any, to agree to be bound by the provisions of this _Section 2.5_ as if it
were Buyer. 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 2.5_, if at the time
any Earn-out Consideration would otherwise be payable to the Shareholders and
the SEU Holders Buyer has made any claim for indemnification (i) under
_Section 10.2(b) through (h)_, (ii) under _Section 10.2(a)_ based upon a
breach of any Company Fundamental Representation or (iii) based upon a claim
of fraud, which claim has not previously been satisfied (an " _Unsatisfied
Claim_ "), then, if the sum of (A) the amount of such Unsatisfied Claim
plus (without duplication) (B) the aggregate amount of Losses claimed by
Buyer with respect to any pending claims under _Article 10_ (the aggregate
amount of the claims under clauses (A) and (B) are hereinafter referred to as
the " _Total Pending Claims_ ") would reduce the aggregate amount of the
Escrow Funds, if any, to zero ($0), then Buyer may offset that portion of the
Earn-out Consideration otherwise payable by Buyer by the amount by which that
portion of the Total Pending Claims attributable to the Unsatisfied Claim
that would reduce the Escrow Funds to an amount of less than zero ($0) (or, if
the actual amount of the Unsatisfied Claim has been determined under _Article
10_ , the actual Losses with respect to such claim as so determined). One
hundred percent (100%) of any remaining balance of the Earn-out Consideration
remaining after such offset shall be paid to Buyers paying agent, with
instructions to pay such amounts to each Shareholder and SEU Holder in
accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares. If, after the final
resolution of any such Unsatisfied Claim, the amount of Losses to which Buyer
is entitled to indemnification from such offset Earn-out Consideration is
less than the amount of such offset, such excess

 



-8-   portion of the previously offset Earn-out Consideration, together with
interest thereon from the date of such offset until the date of such excess is
paid to the paying agent at the rate in effect from time to time under the
Escrow Agreement with respect to the Escrowed Funds, shall be paid to Buyers
paying agent, with instructions to pay such amounts to each Shareholder and
SEU Holder in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares.

2.6 _Surrender of Share Certificates_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in
no event prior to receiving from Buyer the information necessary to finalize
the form of the letter of transmittal referenced below), the Company shall
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represent
outstanding shares of Common Stock, whose shares will be converted into the
right to receive such holders Pro Rata Share of the Adjusted Merger
Consideration and, if applicable, such holders Proportionate Share of the
Earn-out Consideration, a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. Upon the later of (i) the Closing and (ii)
such date subsequent to the Closing as a Certificate (or a Lost
Instrument Affidavit in respect of such Certificate, pursuant to _Section
2.6(d)_) is delivered for cancellation to Buyer or to such agents as may be
appointed by Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and executed, and all other documents and actions required by the
instructions thereto, the holder of such shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Buyers paying agent shall
promptly distribute to such holder by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by such Shareholder in a writing delivered to
Buyer no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Pro Rata
Share of the Adjusted Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, and such Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Following the Effective Time and until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.6(a)_, each Certificate shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive (A) upon such surrender the Adjusted
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.3 _and (B) the portion of the Earn-out Consideration, if any, payable in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.5_.

(b) All Adjusted Merger Consideration and, if applicable, Earn-out
Consideration, paid or payable upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of _Section 2.4_ and this  _Section 2.6_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Buyer for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
2_.

(c) None of Buyer, Buyer Sub or the Company shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Adjusted Merger Consideration or Earn-out Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered (or
a Lost Instrument Affidavit in respect of such Certificate has not been
supplied pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_) prior to one (1) year after the

 



-9-   Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Adjusted Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority), such Adjusted Merger Consideration
and Earn-out Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit (a " _Lost Instrument Affidavit_ ") of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Buyer, the making of an indemnity and the posting of a bond
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Buyer will, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
_Section 2.6(a)_, pay to the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, such holders Pro Rata Share of (i) the Adjusted Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_
and (ii) the Earn-out Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.5_.

 

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article 2_ , Outstanding Shares
held by a Shareholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger, or consented
to the Merger in writing, and who has dissented in accordance with Chapter 13
of the CGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into a right to
receive consideration hereunder, unless and until such Shareholder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such Shareholders dissenters rights
and such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as may be
granted to such holder under the CGCL. If after the Effective Time such
Shareholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such Shareholders
dissenters rights, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the
consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any Outstanding Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the CGCL. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of Outstanding Shares or offer to settle or settle any
such demands. From and after the Closing, the Transaction Representative
shall have the right to direct and make all decisions with respect to all such
proceedings and demands, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth
in  _Section 10.5_ hereof.

2.8 _Withholding_. Buyer or any of its designees shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment payable by Buyer to any Shareholder pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as Buyer or its designee reasonably determines it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any applicable Law (including Shareholder State Tax
Withholding). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Shareholder in respect of whom such deduction or withholding
was made. In the event that Shareholder State Tax Withholding with respect to
a Shareholder is larger than the

 



-10-   Estimated Shareholder State Tax Withholding deducted from payment to such
Shareholder pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, then Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification for such excess pursuant to _Article 10_. In the event that
Shareholder State Tax Withholding with respect to a Shareholder is less than
the Estimated State Tax Withholding deducted from payment to such Shareholder
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, then Buyer shall pay the difference to such
Shareholder within ten (10) days after filing the Tax Return or Tax Returns
with respect to which Shareholder State Tax Withholding was required with
respect to such Shareholder. The Parties are not aware that any such
withholding (other than with respect to amounts payable to the SEU Holders and
any Shareholder State Tax Withholding) is required as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.3 _Disagreement and Resolution_.

(a) During the forty-five (45) day period following delivery of the Closing
Adjustment Statement to the Transaction Representative, Buyer shall provide
the Transaction Representative with reasonable access to such books and
records and personnel of the Company as may be reasonably necessary to enable
the Transaction Representative to evaluate the accuracy of the Closing
Adjustment Statement. Such access shall be at such times and in such a manner
as shall not unreasonably interfere with Buyers operation of the Companys
business. If the Transaction Representative disagrees with the determination
of the Closing Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Company Debt or Transaction
Costs as shown on the Closing Adjustment Statement, then the Transaction
Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within
forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement, which
notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable
detail, identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each
such disagreement and provide reasonable supporting documentation for each
such disagreement. After the end of such forty-five (45) day period, neither
Buyer nor the Transaction Representative may introduce additional
disagreements with respect to any item in the Closing Adjustment Statement or
increase the amount of any disagreement, and any item not so identified shall
be deemed to be agreed to by the Parties and will be final and binding.

(b) If Buyer and the Transaction Representative are unable to resolve all
disagreements properly identified by the Transaction Representative pursuant
to _Section 3.3(a)_ within thirty (30) days after delivery to Buyer of
written notice of such disagreements, then such disagreements shall be
submitted for final and binding resolution to a Neutral Accounting Firm to
resolve such disagreements (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Accounting
Arbitrator shall be KPMG LLP, or, in the event that it is not available or is
not a Neutral Accounting Firm, a Neutral Accounting Firm selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and the Transaction Representative; _provided_ , _that_ ,
(i) if, within fifteen (15) days after the Transaction Representative has
delivered its notice of disagreement to Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_,
the parties are unable to agree on a Neutral Accounting Firm to act as
Accounting Arbitrator, then each party shall select a Neutral Accounting Firm
and such firms together shall select the Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the
Accounting Arbitrator, and (ii) if any party does not select a Neutral
Accounting Firm within ten (10) days of written demand therefor by the other
party, then the Neutral Accounting Firm selected by the other party shall act
as the Accounting Arbitrator. Each party shall be permitted to present a
supporting brief to the Accounting Arbitrator (which supporting brief shall
also be concurrently provided to the other party) within twenty (20) days of
the appointment of the Accounting Arbitrator. Within twenty (20) days of
receipt of a supporting brief, the receiving party may present a responsive
brief to the Accounting Arbitrator (which responsive brief shall also be
concurrently provided to the other party). Each party may

 



-12-   make an oral presentation to the Accounting Arbitrator, in which case, such
presenting party shall notify the other party of such presentation, and the
other party shall have the right to be present at such presentation, within
fifty (50) days of the appointment of the Accounting Arbitrator. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall only consider the briefs and oral presentations of
the parties, and shall not conduct any independent review, in determining
those items and amounts disputed by the parties. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall select either the position of Buyer or the Transaction Representative as
a resolution for each item or amount disputed and may not impose an
alternative resolution with respect to any item or amount disputed and must
resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and the
Transaction Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event
within ninety (90) days after its appointment, a written report setting forth
the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The determination of the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be final and binding in the absence of manifest computational error. The fees
of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Shareholders and the SEU Holders, severally and not jointly, on the
other hand, in such amount(s) as shall be determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator based on the proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed items
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Shareholders and the SEU Holders, on the other
hand, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator, bears to the total amount of
such disputed items so referred to the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution.

3.4_, are the " _Pre-Closing Company Taxes_ ". The estimated Pre-Closing
Company Taxes are the " _Estimated Pre-Closing Company Taxes_ ". For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding this _Section 3.4_ or any other
provision hereof, in no event will the Shareholders bear the Companys portion
of any Taxes payable with respect to the amounts payable under the Retention
Bonus Plan or the Keegan Bonus Agreement.

3.5 _Final Pre-Closing Company Taxes_. Within the 120 day period following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare, or cause the Company to prepare, and
deliver to the Transaction Representative a statement disclosing the amount of

would (x) reasonably be expected to result in the loss of attorney client
privilege or any attorney work product or other legally recognized privileges
or immunity from disclosure (which loss may not be avoided by the entry into
a joint defense or similar agreement between the Company and Buyer) or (y)
contravene any applicable Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the

one of the Company Representatives, such consent not to be unreasonably

commercially reasonable steps to obtain and satisfy, at the earliest
practicable date, all consents, approvals, waivers and notices that are listed

neither the Company nor Buyer shall be required to (i) threaten to, commence
or prosecute any Action, (ii) waive any rights to which it is entitled or
(iii) incur any material financial or other obligation in connection
therewith.

Notification and Report Form and documentary materials in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that substantially comply with the
provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

Department of Justice (and shall file or, in the case of the Company, cause

required by any other Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws)
if such filing is required. Each of Buyer and the Company shall, and the
Company shall cause any such Shareholder to (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental
Authority for additional information or documentation (each such request, a "
_Second Request_ "), (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

commercial efforts to obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, (iv) make any further
filings or information submissions pursuant thereto that may be reasonably
necessary or advisable and (v) promptly make any filings or submissions
required under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of Buyer and the Company
shall, and the Company shall cause any such Shareholder to, use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain any clearance under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws or to resolve any objections that may be asserted by the
applicable Governmental Authority, in each case as promptly as practicable. In
the event such objections cannot be resolved and a Governmental Authority
files suit to enjoin the Merger, Buyer and the Company shall, and the Company
shall cause any such Shareholder to, use commercially reasonable efforts up
to the Outside Date to contest, resist and defend such litigation through all
appeals or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any Court Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by using commercially reasonable efforts up to
the Outside Date to pursue all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal, and if required, to submit to judicial or administrative
orders to hold separate any business or assets of Buyer or its subsidiaries.
Each of Buyer and the Company shall, and the Company shall cause any
such Shareholder to, (A) promptly notify the other party of any written
communication to that party from any Governmental Authority, (B) not agree to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the

(C) to the extent permitted under applicable Law, furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and written communications between such
party and its representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (unless the furnishing of such information
would (1) violate the provisions of any applicable Law or any confidentiality
agreement or (2) cause the loss of the attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _that_ , each such party shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to promptly communicate to the other party the substance
of any such communication, whether by redacting parts of such material
communication or otherwise, so that such communication would not violate
applicable Law or cause the loss of the attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto). 

(i) Without limiting _Section 6.2(b)(i)_, Buyer shall take such actions as
may be reasonably necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) by (i)
proposing negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such

 



-37-   businesses, product lines or assets of the Company that would not, in the
aggregate, be material to the Companys business, and (ii) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Buyers or
its subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability
to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company that would not, in the aggregate, be material to the Companys
business, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction, in any
Action under any Antitrust Laws, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing, and in that regard Buyer shall agree to divest, sell,
dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or Buyers or its subsidiaries
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company that would not, in the aggregate, be material to the Companys
business.

 

(ii) Buyer and the Company may, as each reasonably deems necessary, designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this
_Section 6.2(b)_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Buyer or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)_ may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements in effect on the date of
this Agreement, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns. To the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any
Governmental Authority are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(c) Buyer agrees to provide such security and assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Governmental Authority or other third party whose consent or approval is
sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, (i) Buyer shall be
responsible for all filing fees payable by Buyer to any Governmental Authority
in order to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws and (ii) the Company shall be responsible for all filing
fees payable by the Company to any Governmental Authority in order to obtain
any consents, approvals or waivers under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of the Parties under
this _Section 6.2_ shall not include any requirement of the Parties or any
of their Affiliates to expend any material amount of money (other than normal
legal and professional fees or filing fees and amounts owed under obligations
existing on the date of this Agreement), commence or participate in any
litigation or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third Person.

February 7, 2012 between Buyer and the Company or Perella Weinberg Partners,
on behalf of the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Buyer under this  _Section 6.5_ shall terminate. If this

continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall notify Buyer promptly after obtaining Knowledge of any inaccuracy in
any representation or breach of any warranty or covenant of the Company by
providing an update to the Disclosure Letter. No such update to the Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy or breach for purposes of 
_Section 8.1_, _Section 10.2_ or any other provision of this Agreement and,
to the extent such inaccuracy or breach is not cured by the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may terminate this Agreement to the
extent Buyer is entitled to do so pursuant to _Section 11.1_. However, if
the inaccuracy or breach provided in such Disclosure Letter update relates to
the occurrence of any event, circumstance or condition arising after the date
of this Agreement (without breach of _Section 6.3_) and is of a nature that
would entitle Buyer to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_,
then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Buyer
proceeds to consummate the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
and all rights, remedies or other recourse against the Company, the
Shareholders and the SEU Holders relating to such inaccuracy or breach to
which Buyer might otherwise be entitled, including any rights or remedies
under _Article 10_.

6.7 _No Solicitation of Competing Transactions_.

assets of, or any material equity interest in, the Company or any portion
thereof or relating to any other similar transaction (each a "
_Competing Transaction_ "), (ii) solicit, initiate or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to any Competing
Transaction, or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations

party. If the Company receives any proposal or offer of the nature described
in paragraph (a) above, the Company shall, within one (1) Business Day after
such receipt, notify Buyer of such proposal or offer, including the identity
of the other party and the terms of such proposal or offer.

6.8 _Shareholder Approval_. As promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall solicit the consent of shareholders who own
no less than a majority of the issued and outstanding Common Stock to approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Requisite
Shareholder Consent_ "), and shall use its

 



-41-   reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Consent as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within one (1) day
following the date of this Agreement. 

6.9 _Employee Stock Option Plan_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the Company mailing the letter of
transmittal as provided in  _Section 2.6(a)_ (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), the Company shall cause

respect thereto. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any deduction with respect
to exercise of Stock Options shall be claimed solely on a Pre-Closing Return.

deduct and withhold from the Adjusted Merger Consideration and any Earn-out
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Stock
Option (or any holder of Outstanding Shares acquired upon exercise of a Stock
Option) such Taxes and other amounts as are required under applicable Law to
be deducted or withheld by the Company or any other Person as employer or
withholding agent in connection with the exercise of such Stock Option. All
such amounts so deducted or withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Stock Options (or
holder of Outstanding Shares acquired upon exercise of a Stock Option) in
respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

 

6.10 _Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan_. Effective no later than the day

for the full vesting of the Non-Safe Harbor Non-Elective Contribution Account
(as defined in the Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan) of each employee of the
Company who has such an account, to be effective upon and contingent on the
Closing. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the resolution to terminate
the Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan shall not require such plan to immediately
distribute account balances to participants and (ii) the Company may adopt
and seek IRS approval for any amendments that are necessary to preserve or
obtain a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to the
plans tax-qualified status on its termination.

 

6.11 _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer and to
the IRS a notice, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
certifying that the shares of Common Stock are not "U.S. real property

payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any withholding Tax it
reasonably determines is required under Section 1445 of the Code.

 



-42-  ARTICLE VII

7.1 _Company Agents Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liability for acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time

Agents_ ") as provided in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company or any indemnification agreement between the Company and/or any
Company Agent on the date hereof, as set forth in _Schedule 7.1_ , shall
survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
Company Agent, unless an alteration or modification of such document is
required by Law or the Company Agent affected thereby otherwise consents
in writing thereto.

(b) Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either: (i) cause to be
obtained and have in effect at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to
officers and directors and employment practices liability insurance for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_")
covering the persons who are currently covered by the Companys current DandO
Insurance on terms (as to coverage and amount) no less advantageous in
the aggregate to such persons than under such current DandO Insurance; or (ii)
provide and maintain, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, DandO Insurance covering such persons on terms (as to coverage
and amount) no less advantageous in the aggregate to such persons than under
such current DandO Insurance. In no event shall Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay any premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement and, if the premium for the DandO Insurance required hereunder would
exceed such limitation, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain
as much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for a
premium not in excess of such amount.

(c) In the event that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, Buyer shall ensure that such Person
assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_.

 

7.2 _Tax Matters_.

(a) The Transaction Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
income Tax Returns required or permitted to be filed by the Company for
taxable periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date which are to be filed
after the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Returns_ ") in a manner consistent
with the Companys past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Transaction
Representative shall provide Buyer with a copy of each such Tax Return for
review and comment at least forty-five (45) days prior to the filing of such
Tax Return and shall make any 

 



-43-   changes thereto reasonably requested by Buyer. Buyer shall cause the Company
to execute and file the Pre-Closing Returns as so prepared. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Pre-Closing Returns shall not include any personal Tax Return
of any Shareholder. The Transaction Representative shall pay for the costs and
expenses of preparing and filing all Pre-Closing Returns. Buyer shall, or
shall cause Company to, pay any and all Taxes reflected as due and payable on
all such Pre-Closing Returns, subject to _Article 3_ and the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement. The Shareholders shall also include any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items for such periods on their
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Companys Schedule K-1s for such
periods (including any income, gain, loss deduction or other Tax items
resulting from the 338(h)(10) Election contemplated hereunder) and (subject to
the provisions of this Agreement regarding Shareholder State Tax Withholding)
pay all Taxes imposed on the Shareholders individually as S corporation
shareholders pursuant to Section 1366 of the Code and any analogous provision
of state or local Law. The Parties shall make available to each other (and to
their respective accountants and attorneys) any and all books and records and
other documents and information in its possession or control relating to the
Company reasonably requested by such Persons in order to prepare or review
such Pre-Closing Returns.

(b) Except for the Pre-Closing Returns, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and shall cause the Company to file all Tax Returns for periods
ending prior to or on the Closing Date which are to be filed after the Closing
Date (provided that no amendment of any such Tax Return shall be made without
prior written consent of the Transaction Representative) in a manner
consistent with the Companys past practice, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or to the extent Buyer makes a good faith determination that
a position or other method of reporting in such Tax Return is not more likely
than not to be sustained upon audit, and in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. Buyer shall, or shall cause Company to, pay any and all Taxes
reflected as due and payable on all such Tax Returns subject to _Article 3_
and the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. Buyer shall permit the
Transaction Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to filing, and shall make any
changes thereto reasonably requested by the Transaction Representative.

 

(c) Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
all Tax Returns for the Company required to be filed for all periods
beginning on or after the Closing Date. Buyer shall pay and be liable for (or
shall cause the Company to pay) all Taxes of the Company with respect to such
periods or which arise in respect of any event, action, or transaction which
occurred during such periods.

(d) Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin before the Closing
Date and end after the Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_
") in a manner consistent with the Companys past practice, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law or to the extent Buyer makes a good
faith determination that a position or other method of reporting in such Tax
Return is not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Company to, pay all Taxes reflected as due and payable on all such Tax
Returns subject to _Article 3_ and the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement. Buyer shall permit the Transaction Representative to review and
comment on each such Tax Return described in this _Section 7.2(d)_ prior to
filing, and shall make any changes

 



-44-   thereto reasonably requested by the Transaction Representative prior to
filing. For purposes of this _Section 7.2(d)_, in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending
on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes_ ") shall (i) in
the case of ad valorem and any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related
to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period (adjusted for any acquisitions or dispositions of property
after the Closing Date) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable
period ended on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _that_ , any brackets,
thresholds, exclusion amounts or other similar computational adjustments that
relate to full taxable years shall be apportioned to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date in accordance with the fraction
determined in accordance with clause (i) of this sentence.

 

(e) Buyer and the Shareholders agree that if the Company is permitted but not
required under applicable foreign, state or local Tax laws to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, Buyer and the Shareholders
shall treat such day as the last day of a taxable period; provided, that, in
determining Taxes for such taxable period there shall not be taken into
account any item of income or expense not incurred in the ordinary course of
business of the Company that accrues for tax purposes after the Effective
Time.

 

(f) Buyer and the Shareholders shall each be responsible for fifty percent
(50%) of any transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance, value added, recording,
registration, documentary, filing and other non-income and non-franchise Tax
and administrative fees (including, without limitation, notary fees) arising
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer and Shareholders shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the Parties will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Parties
acknowledge that they are not aware that any Transfer Taxes will be incurred
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

(g) Any credits, refunds and other recoveries of Pre-Closing Straddle Period
Taxes, or any Taxes with respect to periods ending prior to or on the Closing
Date (including the Taxes contemplated by _Section 7.5(e)_), shall belong to
the Persons entitled to the Merger Consideration and be paid to them (pro rata
in proportion to their respective shares of the Merger Consideration as
determined in accordance with this Agreement) promptly upon any credit thereof
to, or receipt or recovery thereof by, Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates (and such payment may be carried out by deposit of the amount of
any such credit, refund or other recovery with the Escrow Agent solely as
paying agent to disburse such amounts to such Persons in such proportions).
Any credits, refunds or recoveries of Taxes for a Straddle Period (other
than Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes) shall belong to the Company and be
paid to Buyer promptly upon any credit thereof to, or receipt or recovery
thereof by, any Shareholder or other Person entitled to Merger Consideration.
All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.

 



-45-  (h) Buyer shall promptly notify the Transaction Representative
following receipt of any notice of audit or other proceeding relating to any
Pre-Closing Return or any other federal or state Tax Return filed on or before
the Closing Date (together with all Pre-Closing Returns, the " _Prior Period
Returns_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Transaction
Representative shall control any and all audits or other proceedings and
litigation relating to any Prior Period Return, including the filing of an
amended Tax Return. Buyer shall have control of any and all audits or other
proceedings and litigation relating to Tax Returns, including the filing of
amended Tax Returns, for all other taxable periods, including Straddle
Periods; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any item of adjustment which
may cause the Shareholders and/or SEU Holders to become obligated to make any
payment pursuant to any provision of this Agreement (including but not limited
to _Section 10.2_), then (i) at the expense of the Shareholders, the
Transaction Representative and representatives appointed by the Transaction
Representative shall have the right to participate in such audit or other
proceeding or litigation and all conference calls, meetings and appearances
with or before the applicable Governmental Authority or tribunal, (ii) Buyer
shall promptly provide to the Transaction Representative or representatives
appointed by the Transaction Representative copies of all written
communications received from the applicable Governmental Authority or
tribunal and shall keep the Transaction Representative or such representatives
reasonably informed regarding the audit, proceeding or litigation, and (iii)
Buyer shall consult with the Transaction Representative regarding the
resolution of any issue that would affect the Shareholders and/or SEU Holders
and not settle any such issue, or file any amended Tax Return relating to such
issue, without the consent of the Transaction Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(i) The Parties shall cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate) fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant
to this _Section 7.2_ and any Tax audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes and payments in respect thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Parties request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Buyer and the Company shall retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. Each
of the Parties shall furnish the other Parties with copies of all relevant
correspondence received from any Governmental Authority in connection with
any Tax audit or information request with respect to any Taxes for which any
other Party may have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Buyer
and the Transaction Representative agree, upon request, to provide the
other Party with all information that either Party may be required to report
pursuant to Sections 6043 and 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 

(j) If the Company has never been a validly electing S corporation within the
meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1362 (or an analogous provision of state or
local Law in the states and localities where the Company has been subject to
income Taxes), or such status was

 



-46-   terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Shareholders shall
cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate) fully and
without delay in any remedial action determined by Buyer to be necessary
under Code Section 1362(f) or any analogous provision, if any, of state or
local Law for the Company to qualify as an S corporation (or to have analogous
status under applicable state or local Laws) for such pre-closing periods as
Buyer determines to be relevant.

(k) For all Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each of
Buyer and the Shareholders agrees to treat any indemnity or hold harmless
payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price received
by the Shareholders for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
dispute regarding such treatment, as well as any dispute regarding Pre-
Closing Company Taxes, shall be submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for
final and binding resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 3.3(b)_, mutatis mutandis.

7.3 _Retention Bonus Plan; Keegan Bonus Agreement_. Buyer shall cause the
Company to (a) make all payments required to be made under the Retention
Bonus Plan and the Keegan Bonus Agreement in accordance with the allocation
schedule set forth in _Schedule 7.3_ and (b) satisfy all other obligations in
connection therewith, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof and
solely to the extent set forth in _Schedule 7.3_. If any participant under the
Retention Bonus Plan or the Keegan Bonus Agreement loses eligibility to
receive a bonus payment under such plan or agreement, or any such bonus
payment is not paid for any other reason, Buyer shall cause the Company to pay
or cause to be paid, promptly after the final payments have been made to all
eligible participants under each such plan, each Shareholder and, subject to 
_Section 12.2_, each SEU Holder an amount equal to such Shareholders or SEU
Holders Proportionate Share of the maximum amount that each such participant
could have thereafter received under such plan or agreement had
such participant under the Retention Bonus Plan or the Keegan Bonus Agreement
not become ineligible or such bonus payment had otherwise not been paid.

7.4 _Benefit Plan Coverage_.

(a) In the event Buyer does not continue the Benefit Plans set forth on
_Schedule 7.4_ , Buyer shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
employees of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") to be
eligible for employee benefit plans that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer
and its Affiliates. To the extent Buyer elects to have Continuing Employees,
and their eligible dependents where applicable, participate in Buyers
employee benefit plans, programs or policies following the Closing Date, (i)
Buyer will allow such Continuing Employees, and their eligible dependents
where applicable, to participate in such plans, programs and policies on
terms substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Buyer and its Affiliates, (ii) each such Continuing Employee will receive
credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and years
of seniority under such plans, programs and policies for years of service
with the Company prior to the Closing Date to the same extent that such
Continuing Employee would have received credit for service under such plans,
programs and policies if the Continuing Employees service had been rendered
to Buyer, and (iii) Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to give
credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid by the Continuing Employees
during the year in which the Closing Date occurs

 



-47-   to the extent that that the Company timely provides to Buyer, in a
commercially reasonable format, the requisite data concerning such
expenditures by the Continuing Employees through the Closing Date and will to
the extent practicable cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any group health plans of Buyer and its Affiliates in which such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents will participate to be
waived.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the Closing Working Capital will contain an
accrual for amounts to be contributed to the Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan.
Buyer shall cause a contribution in the amount of such accrual to be made, for
the benefit of the Continuing Employees, to the profit sharing plan for the
year ending December 31, 2012 that the Continuing Employees participate in
following the Closing.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 7.4_ with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of
the respective Parties and shall not be deemed to be an amendment to any
employee benefit plan and shall not create any right in any other Person,
including any employees, former employees, participants in any Benefit Plan or
any beneficiary thereof.

 

7.5 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(a) At the request of Buyer, the Company and each of the Shareholders, in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1362-6(b)(3)(i), will join with
Buyer in making the elections (collectively, the " _338(h)(10) Election_ ")
with respect to the purchase of the Shares under (i) Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and (ii) any analogous provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
Law, to the extent that such election is separately available, in each state,
local and foreign jurisdiction where the Company currently files income Tax
Returns. At the Closing, the Shareholders will deliver to Buyer two (2)
completed and properly executed (by each Shareholder) original copies of (i)
IRS Form 8023 and required schedules thereto and (ii) to the extent required,
two (2) completed and properly executed originals of any similar forms with
respect to state, local or foreign income Taxes. Prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer will provide the Shareholders with the information regarding Buyer
necessary to enable the Shareholders to complete the forms described in this
_Section 7.5(a)_. The IRS Forms 8023 that each Shareholder delivers to Buyer
at the Closing will be complete in all respects.

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for filing the Form 8023. The Company and the
Shareholders will provide Buyer with any information regarding the Company as
is necessary for Buyer to complete IRS Form 8883 and any supplements thereto.
Buyer shall complete IRS Form 8883 taking into account the allocation of the
Tax Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_. Buyer shall provide a
copy of the completed Form 8883 to the Company and the Shareholders. Each of
the Company, the Shareholders and Buyer shall be responsible for filing the
Form 8883 with the appropriate Tax Returns.

(c) Each of the Shareholders and Buyer shall file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election unless otherwise required by
applicable Law and the allocation of the Tax Purchase Price determined in
accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_, and will not take any position contrary
thereto. The Shareholders shall include any income, gain, loss,

 



-48-   deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election
on their Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(d) Buyer and the Shareholders agree that, except as Buyer and the Transaction
Representative may otherwise agree in writing or as may be required otherwise
pursuant to a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law, for
United States federal income Tax purposes, the amount of the adjusted deemed
sale price (as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations §1.338-4) for the
assets of the Company (collectively, the " _Tax Purchase Price_ ") deemed
acquired pursuant to the 338(h)(10) Election shall be allocated in accordance
with Treasury Regulations §§1.338-6 and 1.338-7 as determined in accordance
with an allocation of Tax Purchase Price (" _Tax Purchase Price Allocation_ ")
prepared and determined in accordance with this _Section 7.5(d)_. Buyer
shall engage, at its expense, a Valuation Firm to provide a proposed Tax
Purchase Price Allocation within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
Effective Time which Buyer shall deliver to the Transaction Representative
for comment. Buyer will consider in good faith any comments of the Transaction
Representative with respect to such proposed Tax Purchase Price Allocation
that are furnished to Buyer within thirty (30) days after such allocation is
so provided to the Transaction Representative. If Buyer and the Transaction
Representative fail to agree in all respects upon a Tax Purchase Price
Allocation within thirty (30) days after the proposed Tax Purchase Price
Allocation is so provided to the Transaction Representative, then any aspects
of such proposal not agreed by them shall be submitted to a Valuation Firm
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Transaction Representative for final and
binding resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
3.3(b)_, but with the Valuation Firm taking the role of the Accounting
Arbitrator referenced in such _Section 3.3(b)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and in accordance with
_Article 3_ and the indemnification provisions hereunder, the Shareholders
and SEU Holders shall bear the burden for the payment of any Taxes imposed on
the Company by reason of the 338(h)(10) Election (including (i) any Tax
imposed under Section 1374 of the Code, (ii) any Tax imposed under Treasury
Regulation § 1.338(h)(10)-1, and (iii) any state, local or foreign Tax imposed
on the Companys gain).

(f) The Parties acknowledge that certain principal Shareholders are entering
into certain noncompetition agreements with Buyer and the Company on the date
hereof that will become effective upon the Closing and that such Shareholders
will be compensated in connection therewith as set forth in such
noncompetition agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that for Tax purposes, no amount of the Merger Consideration or Tax
Purchase Price shall be allocated to any of such noncompetition agreements, it
being agreed that Buyer would not enter into this Agreement but for the
restrictions set forth in such agreements and therefore the amount of Losses
Buyer may suffer under such agreements as a result of a breach of thereof
would not be limited to the amount of compensation set forth therein.

7.6 _SEU Payments_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if the 338(h)(10)
Election is made, the SEU Payments due at the Closing will be included in the
Tax Purchase Price and that any deduction (other than amortization
deductions) with respect thereto will be claimed solely on a Pre-Closing
Return (and that any SEU Payments due and payable after the

 



-49-   Closing are, to the extent actually paid to the SEU Holders, includible in
the Tax Purchase Price at the time of payment, and that any deduction with
respect thereto will be claimed solely on or as though reflected on an S
corporation Tax Return of the Company and passed through to the Shareholders
in accordance with Subchapter S of the Code).

ARTICLE X 

INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 _Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_. No claim may be
made for a breach of a covenant or agreement contained herein to be performed
prior to the Closing Date after the expiration of the Survival Period. Any
covenant and agreement to be performed after the Closing Date shall survive
the Closing indefinitely, except as otherwise provided herein. Except as
expressly provided otherwise herein, each representation and warranty
contained herein shall survive the Closing until, and will expire and be of no
force and effect, upon (except with respect to claims for breaches theretofore
asserted in the manner provided for herein by the Transaction Representative,
on behalf of the Shareholders and the SEU Holders, to Buyer or by Buyer to
the Transaction Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders and the SEU
Holders, as the case may be, on or before) the Escrow Termination Date, except
that (a) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Sections 4.1(a)_ (Organization and Power), _4.2_ (Authority and
Enforceability) and _4.4(a)_ and _(b)_ (Capitalization) and any claim based
upon fraud in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall
survive the Closing indefinitely, (b) the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Sections 4.8_ (Taxes), _4.15_ (Employee Benefits)
(to the extent related to Taxes) and _4.24_ (No Brokers) shall survive the
Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, (c) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in _Sections 4.11_  (Intellectual Property) shall survive the Closing
for three (3) years (such representations and warranties set forth in clauses
(a), (b) and (c) hereof, the " _Company Fundamental Representations_ "), (d)

and unambiguously intend that, except for claims relating to fraud in

Fundamental Representations (for which the longer survival periods described
above shall apply), the Survival Period shall replace any statute of
limitations for the representations or warranties or pre-Closing covenants or
agreements that would

to an Indemnitor, before expiration of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, notice of such claim in accordance with the provisions of this

warranty, covenant or agreement then the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only for purposes
of, the final resolution of the matter covered by such notice (including the
final determination and/or payment of any Losses which any Indemnified Party
may incur at any future date to the extent of the matter covered by such
notice or otherwise arising out of the matter covered by such notice). Except
as otherwise provided in _Section 6.6_, the rights to indemnification and to
be held harmless set forth in this  _Article 10_ shall not be affected by (i)
any investigation conducted by or on behalf of Buyer or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) by Buyer, whether before or after the date of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or
noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which
is the subject of indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by Buyer of
any closing condition relating to the accuracy of representations and
warranties or the performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

10.2 _Indemnification by the Shareholders and the SEU Holders_. After the
Closing Date and subject to the limitations set forth herein, including those
set forth in _Section 10.2(g)(iv)_ below, each Shareholder and SEU Holder, on
a basis providing for equal responsibility for purposes of determining an
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless, shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) for such
Shareholders or SEU Holders Proportionate Share of any and all losses,
claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys and accountants fees) (" _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or any Affiliate thereof resulting
from, arising from or constituting:

(a) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of the
Company contained in this Agreement as of the date hereof or as of the Closing
Date (in each case, as such representation or warranty (other than the
representations and warranties in  _Section 4.6(e)_, _Section 4.7(a)_,
_Section 4.7(b)(i)_, _Section 4.7(b)(ii)(A)_, _Section 4.11(a)_, _Section
4.11(c)(ii)_ and _Section 4.13_) would read if all qualifications as to
materiality, including each reference to the defined term "Material Adverse
Effect", were deleted therefrom), regardless (for the avoidance of doubt) of
whether such Shareholder or SEU Holder had any knowledge of such breach
or inaccuracy;

(b) any failure to perform prior to the Effective Time any covenant or
agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any other
agreement or instrument furnished by the Company pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any Company Debt existing as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, to the
extent not deducted from the Merger Consideration at the Closing;

 



-54-  (d) any Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent not included in the calculation
of the Estimated Pre-Closing Company Taxes or Company Debt;

(e) any amounts paid or owed by the Surviving Corporation to any Shareholder
with respect to any Dissenting Shares to the extent that the aggregate amount
of such payments, together with the aggregate amount of all Losses with
respect thereto, exceeds the consideration that otherwise would have been
payable to such Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement if such Shareholder had
not exercised his, her or its appraisal rights pursuant to Chapter 13 of the
CGCL;

 

(f) any claim by a Shareholder, SEU Holder or any other Person seeking to
assert, or based upon any rights to receive any Merger Consideration or other
payment in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
excess of the amount payable to such Shareholder, SEU Holder or any other
Person as set forth on the Allocation Schedule;

 

(g) the matter described in item 4 of _Section 4.12_ of the Disclosure
Letter; and

 

(h) the matter described in item 1 of _Section 4.18_ of the Disclosure
Letter, but only to the extent that such Losses exceed Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000); provided, however, that:

(i) Except in the case of a claim for a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the
Company Fundamental Representations (other than the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 4.11_ (Intellectual
Property)) or fraud in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
the indemnity and hold harmless obligations under clause (a) of this _Section
10.2_ shall apply only to the extent that (A) the amount of the Losses related
to each individual claim (or series of related claims) exceeds Thirty
Thousand Dollars ($30,000), which shall not be applied against the Basket
Amount; and (B) the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds Seven Million
Dollars ($7,000,000) (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and then only in respect of
such excess;

(i) Except in the case of a claim for a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the
Company Fundamental Representations or fraud in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer shall be entitled to recover on the
indemnity and hold harmless obligations under clause (a) of this  _Section
10.2_ only from the Escrowed Funds (to the extent thereof) and not directly
against any Shareholder or SEU Holder. For the avoidance of doubt, except in
the case of a claim for a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the
Company Fundamental Representations or fraud in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, in the event Buyer is entitled to
indemnification and to be held harmless for Losses hereunder from the
Shareholders and the SEU Holders under clause (a) of this _Section 10.2_,
Buyer shall only be able to recover for such Losses from the Escrowed Funds
(to the extent thereof);

(ii) In the case of any claims (the " _Intellectual Property Claims_ ") for
any breach of, or any inaccuracy in, the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in  _Section 4.11_ (the " _Intellectual Property
Representation_ "), Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall any
Shareholder or SEU Holder have any liability hereunder in an aggregate 

 



-55-   amount in excess of the lesser of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of the
portion of the Merger Consideration paid or payable to such Shareholder or SEU
Holder and (y) twenty-five percent (25%) of such Persons Proportionate Share
of any Losses related thereto; _provided_ , _that_ , in the case of any
Intellectual Property Claims made on or prior to the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date or any intentional breaches of, or intentional
inaccuracies in, the Intellectual Property Representation, the foregoing
limitation shall not apply, and in such case, Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that in no event shall any Shareholder or SEU Holder have any liability
hereunder in an aggregate amount in excess of the lesser of (x) the portion of
the Merger Consideration paid or payable to such Shareholder or SEU Holder and
(y) such Persons Proportionate Share of any Losses related thereto.

(iii) Notwithstanding the statement in the first sentence of _Section 10.2_
as to the equal responsibility of the Shareholders and the SEU Holders or any
other provision herein, and for the avoidance of doubt (but without limiting
_Section 10.2(g)_), in no event shall any Shareholder or SEU Holder have any
liability hereunder (including for fraud in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) in an aggregate amount in excess of the lesser of (A) the
portion of the Merger Consideration paid or payable to such Shareholder or SEU
Holder and (B) such Persons Proportionate Share of any Losses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not be applicable, in the case
of fraud in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, to any
Shareholder or SEU Holder who shall have committed such fraud.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer
shall not attempt to collect any Losses or other amounts for which the
Shareholders and SEU holders have liability under this Agreement directly from
any Shareholder or SEU Holder unless and to the extent there are insufficient
unclaimed Escrowed Funds remaining to satisfy such Losses pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement (and then only if and to the extent the Shareholders and SEU
Holders have liability under this Agreement in excess of the Escrowed Funds).
No Shareholder or SEU Holder shall have any right of contribution against the
Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by the Company
of, or any inaccuracies in, any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements.

 

10.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. After the Closing Date and subject to the
limitations set forth herein, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Shareholders and SEU Holders and hold the Shareholders and SEU Holders
harmless for any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Shareholders or
SEU Holders resulting from, relating to or constituting:

 

(a) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Buyer contained in this Agreement as of the date hereof or as of the Closing
Date (in each case, as such representation or warranty would read if all
qualifications as to materiality were deleted therefrom); and

 

(b) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Buyer or post-Closing
covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument furnished by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

 



-56-  10.4 _Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) Any Party seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall give promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such
Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") describing in reasonable detail, to the extent then known, (i) the facts
giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder, (ii) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and (iii) a reference
to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim
is based. For purposes of this _Section 10.4_ and _10.5_ , (i) if the
Shareholders and the SEU Holders comprise the Indemnitor, any references to
the Indemnitor (except provisions relating to an obligation to make any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Transaction Representative, and (ii)
if the Shareholders and the SEU Holders comprise the Indemnified Party, any
references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions relating to an
obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) shall be deemed to
refer to the Transaction Representative. The failure to give a Claim Notice
shall not waive an Indemnified Partys right to indemnification except to the
extent of any damage, liability or prejudice caused by or arising out of such
failure.

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article 10_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final and binding decision of
the Arbitrator or the Appellate Arbitrators in accordance with _Section
10.4(b)_; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall agree in writing. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be
deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken, and the decision of the Appellate Arbitrators
shall be deemed final when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it. All amounts due to the
Indemnified Party as so finally determined shall be paid by wire transfer
within ten (10) days after such final determination; _provided_ , _that_ , if
the Indemnitor is a Shareholder or SEU Holder, and such amounts are to be paid
solely from the Escrowed Funds in accordance with the provisions of _Section
10.2_, such amounts due shall be disbursed from the Escrowed Funds (to the
extent thereof), and none of the Shareholders or the SEU Holders shall have
any additional liability or obligation to the Indemnified Party.

10.5 _Third Person Claims_.

 

(a) In order for a Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party, such
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable
detail (to the extent then known), of the third Person claim promptly
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third Person
claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give notice shall not
waive an Indemnified Partys right to indemnification except to the extent of
any damage, liability or prejudice caused by or arising out of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within five
(5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
material notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim.

 



-57-  (b) In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against
the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the right,
exercisable during the twenty (20) Business Day period following its receipt
of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to control and defend against
any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or
damage indemnified against hereunder with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ; _however_ , that (i) the Indemnitor may
only continue to retain control of such defense (A) following the 140th day
after Buyers delivery of the Claims Notice to the Indemnitor if the
Indemnitor by such date acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that
any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against
the Indemnified Party in connection with such third Person claim constitute
Losses for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this
_Article 10_ (but subject to the limitations contained herein) and (B) if the
maximum amount of Losses for which it may reasonably be expected to be liable
under this Agreement (including, where applicable, any limitations resulting
from the then current unreserved balance of the Escrowed Funds) with respect
to such third Person Claim (assuming for this purpose that the third Person
will be successful on the merits of such third Person claim), when added to
the estimated costs of defense thereof and the maximum amount of Losses
for which it may reasonably be expected to be liable under this Agreement for
all unresolved claims for indemnification then pending is more than half of
the maximum amount claimed with respect to such third Person claim and all of
such other unresolved claims, including the estimated costs of the defense of
all such claims, and (ii) the Indemnitor may not assume control of the defense
of any such third Person claim involving criminal liability or in which
material equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party or any of
its subsidiaries. If the Indemnitor does not, or is not permitted under the
terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of any such third Person
claim, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense and the Indemnitor
may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its
expense. The assumption of the defense of a third Party claim during the 140
day period referred to above shall not be an admission as to the liability of
the Indemnitor in respect of such third Party claim or be deemed an acceptance
or acknowledgment of the Indemnitors obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless the Indemnified Party in respect of such third Party claim. The party
controlling the defense of such third Person claim (the " _Controlling Party_
") shall keep the non-Controlling Party advised of the status of such third
Person claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith the
recommendations made by the non-Controlling Party with respect thereto. If
the Indemnitor has the right to, and timely elects to, assume control of the
defense of a third Person claim, any fees and expenses of legal counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party with respect to such third Person claim
shall not be considered Losses for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification under this _Article 10_ unless the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes that the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party have a
conflict of interests or materially different defenses available with respect
to such third Person claim. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party
may settle or compromise any such proceeding without the written consent of
the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _that_ , the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be
required if the Indemnitor agrees in writing to pay (and pays) any amounts
payable pursuant to such settlement or compromise and such settlement or
compromise includes a complete written release of the Indemnified Party (and
its Affiliates) from further liability, does not contain an admission of
liability and does not impose any injunctive relief, any operational
restrictions or any other obligations on the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates.

 



-58-  (c) The parties agree to cooperate reasonably with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such third
Person claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision
of records and information which is reasonably relevant to such third Person
claim, and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

(d) With respect to any third Person claim subject to indemnification under
this _Article 10_ , the Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to
preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all
confidential information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges
of the other Party. In connection therewith, each Party agrees that: (i) it
will use its commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any third Party
claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid
production of confidential information (consistent with Law and rules of
procedure); and (ii) all communications between any Party and counsel
responsible for or participating in the defense of any third Party claim
shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privilege. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this _Section 10.5(d)_ shall require a Party to share information with
any other Party if the sharing of such information would result in the loss of
any applicable attorney-client, work-product or similar privilege.

 

(e) In the event that any provision of this _Section 10.5_ is inconsistent
with the provisions of  _Section 7.2_, the provisions in _Section 7.2_
shall control.

(f) The defense of the matters which are indemnifiable under _Section
10.2(g)_ and _Section 10.2(h)_ hereof shall be subject to the additional
procedures set forth in _Schedule 10.5(f)_.

 

10.6 _Limitations_.

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses, such amount shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance benefits and proceeds (collectively, "
_Insurance Benefits_ ") actually recovered by Buyer or the Company under
applicable insurance policies and, upon the written request of the Transaction
Representative, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
such Insurance Benefits, it being agreed that (i) Buyer shall not be required
to commence a lawsuit against any insurer and (ii) all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, and any increase in insurance premiums, incurred by Buyer in
connection with or as a result of such collection efforts shall constitute
Losses for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement,
whether or not Buyer is successful in collecting such Insurance Benefits. If
Buyer or the Company receives any Insurance Benefits subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnitors, and provided Buyer has
collected all sums due from the Indemnitors, then the amount of Losses to be
recovered by Buyer shall be recalculated, taking into account the limitations
of this _Article 10_ , as if such Insurance Benefits had been received prior
to the collection of any Losses under this Agreement and any excess Losses
previously collected after such recalculation shall be repaid to the Escrowed
Funds (if applicable), or after the release of the Escrowed Funds, such
amount shall be paid the Indemnitors.

 



-59-  (b) In calculating any Losses, there shall be deducted (i)
any indemnification, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered
by the Indemnified Party thereof from any third Person with respect thereto;
and (ii) any Tax benefit or refund to which the applicable Indemnified Party
is actually entitled as a result of such Losses, which Tax benefit in the
case of income Taxes shall be calculated based on the actual combined federal
and state income Tax rate applicable to such Indemnified Party. Any such
amounts or benefits received by an Indemnified Party with respect to any
indemnity and hold harmless claim after it has received an indemnity or hold
harmless payment hereunder shall be promptly paid over to the Indemnitor;
_provided_ , _that_ , the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to pay
over any such amount or benefit in excess of the amount paid by the Indemnitor
to the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.

(c) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment
required hereunder is determined after payment by any Shareholder or SEU
Holder of any amount otherwise required to be paid as indemnification
pursuant hereto, Buyer shall repay, promptly after such determination, any
amount that any Shareholder or SEU Holder would not have had to pay pursuant
hereto had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

 

(d) Except for claims for fraud in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law and
injunctive and provisional relief, if the Closing occurs, this _Article 10_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and recourse for breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) No Party shall have any liability for any punitive or special damages or
Losses, it being agreed that any such amounts payable to any third Person
pursuant to an indemnifiable third Person claim shall constitute Losses which
may be recovered by the applicable Indemnified Party.

 

(f) No Shareholder or SEU Holder shall have any liability for any Loss to the
extent that the Loss sustained or incurred by the Indemnified Party was
accrued for on the Closing Balance Sheet.

10.7 _Mitigation_. Each of the Parties agrees to take commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate their respective Losses under this _Article 10_ upon and
after becoming aware of any event or condition which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

10.8 _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article 10_ (or the deemed making of
a payment by the Shareholders and the SEU Holders through the disbursements of
Escrowed Funds to Buyer), the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any
third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim and the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted
by Law and the provisions of any applicable Contract, assign any such rights
to the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
Shareholders or SEU Holders be permitted to bring any such subrogation claim
against any Person that has been a customer of the Company within the year
prior to such claim without Buyers prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably

 



-60-   withheld or delayed. In no event shall Buyer or the Company be required to
commence any action or be the named plaintiff in any such subrogation claim.

Party:

 

(i) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to October 31, 2012
(the " _Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ , _that_ , the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ shall not be available to the Party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such

used its commercially reasonable efforts to remove or lift such Court Order or

(b) by the Company, by giving written notice to Buyer in the event Buyer is in
breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, and such breach or inaccuracy, individually or in
combination with any other such breach or inaccuracy, (i) would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ not to be satisfied and (ii) is not
cured within twenty (20) days following delivery by the Company to Buyer of
written notice of such breach;

(c) by Buyer, by giving written notice to the Company in the event the Company
is in breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination
with any other such breach or inaccuracy, (i) would cause the conditions set

twenty (20) days following delivery by Buyer to the Company of written notice

or further obligation to any other Party, and no Party shall be entitled to
any monetary damages as a result of such termination, or any indemnification
under  _Article 10_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
termination of this Agreement limit or restrict the rights and remedies of any
Party against any other Party which has intentionally and willfully breached
any of the agreements or other provisions of this Agreement prior to the
termination hereof; and provided, further, that the provisions of _Section
6.5_ (Confidentiality), and _Article 12_ (General Provisions) shall remain in
full force and effect following the termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

12.1 _Transaction Representative_.

(a) Emiko Terasaki, M.D. has been designated, by vote of Shareholders who
held a majority of the outstanding Common Stock on the date of this Agreement,
as the Shareholders and the SEU Holders exclusive representative (such
person, or any successor so appointed by the Shareholders and the SEU
Holders, is referred to herein as the " _Transaction Representative_ ") from
and after the Closing Date with respect to the matters set forth in this
Agreement, including full power and authority on the Shareholders and the
SEU Holders behalf (i) to take all actions which the Transaction
Representative considers necessary or desirable in connection with the
defense, pursuit or settlement of any determinations relating to any
claims for indemnification hereunder, including determinations to sue,
defend, negotiate, settle and compromise any such claims for indemnification
made by or against, and other disputes with, Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
or any of the agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to engage
and employ agents and to incur such other expenses as the Transaction
Representative shall deem necessary or prudent in connection with the
administration of the foregoing, (iii) to accept and receive notices to the
Shareholders and the SEU Holders pursuant to this Agreement, and (iv) to take
all other actions and exercise all other rights which the Transaction
Representative considers necessary or appropriate in connection with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Transaction Representative shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on
behalf of any Shareholder or SEU Holder shall otherwise exist against the
Transaction Representative.

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken by the
Transaction Representative without any liability to, or obligation to inquire
of, any Shareholder or SEU Holder even if Buyer shall be aware of any actual
or potential dispute or disagreement among the Shareholders and/or SEU
Holders. Buyer is expressly authorized to rely on the genuineness of the
signature of the Transaction Representative and, upon receipt of any writing
which reasonably appears to have been signed by the Transaction
Representative, Buyer may act upon the same without any further duty of
inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

 



-62-  (c) The Transaction Representative shall promptly deliver to a Shareholder or
SEU Holder any notice received by the Transaction Representative on behalf of
such Shareholder or SEU Holder.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, the Company shall not be permitted to make
amendments to, or waive any provision of, this Agreement or grant any consent
under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Transaction
Representative.

(e) Neither the Transaction Representative nor any agent employed by the
Transaction Representative shall be liable to any Shareholder or SEU Holder
relating to the performance of such Transaction Representatives duties under
this Agreement for any errors in judgment, negligence (including gross
negligence), oversight, breach of duty or otherwise except to the extent it is
finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and
convincing evidence that the actions taken or not taken by the Transaction
Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith.

(f) The Transaction Representative shall hold and be entitled to use the
Transaction Representative Funds for the purposes of paying for, or
reimbursing Transaction Representative for, any and all costs and expenses
(including counsel and legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Transaction
Representative in connection with the protection, defense, enforcement or
other exercise or fulfillment of any rights or obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (collectively, the " _Transaction
Representative Expenses_ "). To the extent that the Transaction Representative
Funds are insufficient to cover the Transaction Representative Expenses, each
Shareholder and SEU Holder, promptly upon request by the Transaction
Representative and in any event within ten (10) days of such request, shall
reimburse the Transaction Representative for such Shareholders or SEU
Holders Proportionate Share of such Transaction Representative Expenses. The
Transaction Representative shall hold the Transaction Representative Funds in
a segregated bank account and shall not comingle it with any other funds. At
such time as the Transaction Representative deems appropriate, the
Transaction Representative shall distribute to each Shareholder and, subject
to _Section 12.2_, each SEU Holder an amount equal to such Shareholders or
SEU Holders Proportionate Share of any remaining Transaction Representative
Funds.

12.2 _SEU Payments_. All SEU Payments shall be made in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the SEU Plan. The Company, Buyer and the Escrow Agent
and their agents, as directed by Buyer, shall deduct and withhold from the SEU
Payments and the payments of Earn-out Consideration to such SEU Holders such
Taxes and other amounts as are required under applicable Law to be deducted
or withheld by the Company or any other Person as employer or withholding
agent in connection with such SEU Payments and Earn-out Consideration
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Companys portion of any Taxes
payable to the extent not previously included in the computation of Company
Debt) (collectively, the " _SEU Withholdings_ "). The SEU Withholdings shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to each SEU
Holder in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made. The Escrow
Agreement shall make similar provision for the SEU Payments and the associated
required income and employment Tax required to be withheld solely by reason
of such payments with respect to each subsequent distribution of the Escrowed
Funds.

 



-63-  12.3 _No Public Announcement_. From the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, no Party shall (nor shall Buyer permit its subsidiaries to
nor shall the Company permit its Affiliates to), without the written approval
of the other (it being agreed that after the Closing, the Transaction
Representative shall have the right to grant consents on behalf of the
Shareholders and the SEU Holders), make any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of the other transaction documents contemplated hereby, except as and to the
extent that any such Party shall be so obligated by applicable Law or stock
exchange requirement, in which case such Party shall, to the extent
practicable, allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement and shall incorporate such comments if reasonable and the
Parties otherwise shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures by a Party
necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement.

12.4 _Notices_. All notices, consents or other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered
(a) when delivered personally, against written receipt, (b) if sent by

(provided that in the case of a matter that effects two or more Shareholders
and/or SEU Holders, only one Representative shall be granted access) shall
have reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Company relating
to Taxes and Tax Returns of the Company, to the extent that such access may
reasonably be required by a Shareholder or SEU Holder in connection the
preparation of the Shareholders or SEU Holders Tax Returns or in connection
with any Tax audits and (ii) the Transaction Representative, on behalf of the
Shareholders and SEU holders, to the extent that such access may reasonably be
required by a Shareholder or SEU Holder in connection with the defense of a
third Person claim or the prosecution against a third Person of a claim to
which the Shareholders and SEU Holders have been subrogated pursuant to
_Section 10.8_. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours and in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Companys
business. The Shareholder of SEU Holder seeking access shall be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this 
_Section 12.7(a)_. If Buyer or the Company shall desire to dispose of any of
such books or records prior to the expiration of such seven (7) year period,
Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give the Transaction Representative,
on behalf of the Shareholders and SEU Holders, a reasonable opportunity, at

meaning when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement in its entirety
and not to any particular article, Section or provision hereof. Except when

(c) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement, the
Parties understand and agree that the same have or has been mutually
negotiated, prepared and drafted, and that if at any time the Parties desire
or are required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any
agreement or instrument subject thereto, no consideration shall be given to
the issue of which Party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term
or condition of this Agreement.

(d) The terms "made available" and "provided to" when used in reference to
one Person having made or making items or information available to, or to
having provided information to, another, shall mean that such items or

(e) The Disclosure Letter shall be construed with and as an integral part of
this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein;

waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, in writing by the
Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof. The failure of any Party to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any Party thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

12.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party will pay

any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to
the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

delivered via facsimile transmission or via email with scan or email
attachment will be deemed an original for all intents and purposes.

 

12.14 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes hereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that

the State of Delaware; provided that, to the extent required by the CGCL,
matters relating to the Merger and the fiduciary duties of the Companys board
of directors shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of California.

12.15 _Dispute Resolution_. All claims, controversies or disputes arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort
or otherwise, including arbitrability and any claim that this Agreement was
induced by fraud (" _Covered Claims_ "), shall be resolved by binding
arbitration (i) in Wilmington, Delaware, in the case of any pre-Closing claim
(except as provided in clause (ii)), (ii) in Los Angeles, California, in the
case of any (A) pre-Closing claim made by Buyer against the Company for any
breach by the Company of any covenants contained in _Section 6.3_ or (B)
post-Closing claim made by Buyer (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any defense
thereof by the Transaction Representative) or (iii) in Boston, Massachusetts,
in the case of a post-Closing claim made by the Company or the Transaction
Representative, in each case in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:

(a) _Administrator_. The arbitration of all Covered Claims will be
administered by the Wilmington, Los Angeles or Boston offices, as the case may
be, of JAMS (the " _Arbitration Administrator_ ").

(b) _Procedural Law_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitration
of all Covered Claims will be governed by the procedural Law of the state in
which the arbitration is taking place (including the Code of Civil Procedure,
Civil Code, Evidence Code and Rules of Court (excluding local rules and the
procedural references contained with such states arbitration statute)) as if
the Covered Claims had been brought in a trial court of general jurisdiction
of such state; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the parties waive any right
to jury; (ii) there shall be no interlocutory appellate relief (such as
writs) available; and (iii) discovery will be limited to matters which are
directly relevant to the issues in the arbitration.

 



-68-  (c) _Arbitrator_. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
arbitrator (" _Arbitrator_ "), who shall be a retired judge in the Wilmington,
Los Angeles or Boston office, as the case may be, of the Judicial Arbitration
and Mediation Service (" _JAMS_ "), to be selected as follows: Within seven
(7) Business Days from service of an arbitration complaint, the Parties will
either agree upon an Arbitrator or, failing such agreement, shall exchange
lists containing the names of five (5) such candidates proposed by each party
to serve in such capacity. No later than the third Business Day thereafter,
the parties will serve each other with a combined list (i.e., the Parties ten
(10) proposed candidates) ranking each candidate in order of preference (one
(1) being the most preferred and ten (10) being the least preferred) (the "
_Combined List_ "). If any proposed candidate shall be common to both lists,
that person shall serve as the Arbitrator (with the person whose last name
comes first alphabetically being chosen in case more than one person is common
to both lists). Otherwise the candidate with the lowest aggregate ranking
shall serve as the Arbitrator (with the person whose last name comes first
alphabetically being chosen in case of a tie). If any person selected in
accordance with the procedures provided in this Section is unable or unwilling
to act as the Arbitrator, the person whose ranking is next lowest shall be
approached until an Arbitrator is selected. If none of the candidates on the
Combined List is capable or willing to serve as the Arbitrator, the parties
may either agree to repeat the process until an Arbitrator is selected or, at
the election of either party, proceed in accordance with the then prevailing
rules of the Arbitration Administrator regarding arbitrator selection. If, at
any time following the selection of an Arbitrator, the Arbitrator is unable or
unwilling to continue serving, the candidate on the Combined List with the
next lowest ranking shall be approached until a replacement Arbitrator is
selected in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Section.

 

(d) Reserved.

(e) _Excluded Claims_. " _Covered Claims_ " as used in this Agreement does not
include compulsory or permissive cross-claims between or among the parties
that arise in a legal action brought by or against a non-signatory hereto ("
_Non-Signatory Action_ "). However, a Party that has the right to assert a
permissive cross-claim against another Party in a Non-Signatory Action may
choose to treat that claim as a Covered Claim and assert it in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, "Covered Claims" do not include
claims that are subject to resolution by the Accounting Arbitrator as provided
in _Article 3_ and  _Section 7.5_ or claims for injunctive relief, including
specific performance.

(f) _Record and Proceedings_. A full stenographic or electronic record of all
proceedings in the arbitration shall be maintained, and the Arbitrator shall
issue rulings, a statement of decisions and a judgment as if the Arbitrator
were a sitting Judge of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, with all
of the powers (including with respect to remedies) vested in such a judge.

(g) _Appeal_.

(i) To appeal the judgment of an Arbitrator, a party must follow all of the
prerequisites for appealing a judgment in a state trial court of general
jurisdiction in the state in which the arbitration was held, directing all
such prerequisites to the Arbitration Administrator 

 



-69-   in lieu of the clerk. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Arbitration
Administrator shall be directed by the parties to transfer all relevant
documents to the Appellate Arbitrators. 

(ii) All appeals will be made to three (3) neutral arbitrators ("
_Appellate Arbitrators_ "), each of whom shall be a retired judge in the
Wilmington, Los Angeles or Boston office, as the case may be, of the JAMS,
selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 12.15(c)_;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that within seven (7) days of service of the
Arbitrators judgment, the Parties shall seek to agree upon the Appellate
Arbitrators and, failing such agreement, shall exchange new lists of proposed
arbitrators (which may but need not contain any of the names on the Combined
List).

(iii) The Appellate Arbitrators will conduct a hearing, review the judgment
of the Arbitrator, and issue an appellate decision applying the same standards
of review (and all of the same presumptions) as if the Appellate Arbitrators
were judges of the appellate court to which a trial judgment rendered in the
state where the arbitration was held may be appealed in the first instance.
The Appellate Arbitrators will be vested with the same powers as such trial
court (including the power to remand a matter to an Arbitrator).

 

(iv) The Appellate Arbitrators decision will be final and binding (unless
remanded to the Arbitrator) as to all matters of substance and procedure and
may not be vacated by any court.

(h) _Res Judicata, Collateral Estoppel and Law of the Case_. A decision of
the Arbitrator and Appellate Arbitrators shall have the same force and effect
with respect to collateral estoppel, res judicata and Law of the case that
such decision would have been entitled to if decided in a court of law, but
in no event shall such a decision be used by or against a Party to this
Agreement in a Non-Signatory Action.

(i) _Jurisdiction/Venue/Enforcement of Award_. The Parties consent and submit
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of (i) the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, in the case of a pre-Closing claim (except as provided in clause
(ii)), (ii) the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles or
the United States District Court for the Central District of California,
located in Los Angeles, California, in the case of a post-Closing claim by
Buyer or a pre-Closing claim made by Buyer against the Company for any breach
by the Company of any covenants contained in _Section 6.3_, and (iii) the
Superior Court of Massachusetts for Middlesex County or the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in the case of a post-
Closing claim by the Company or the Transaction Representative, in each case
to compel arbitration of Covered Claims in accordance with this Agreement, to
enforce any arbitration award granted pursuant to this Agreement, including,
but not limited to, any award granting equitable relief, and to otherwise
enforce this Agreement and carry out the intentions of the Parties to resolve
all Covered Claims through arbitration.

(j)  _Confidentiality_. All arbitration proceedings, including, but not
limited to any appellate proceedings, will be closed to the public and
confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed,
except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the judgment of the
Arbitrator or the decision of the Appellate Arbitrators, as applicable, and
except

 



-70-   as necessary to give effect to res judicata and collateral estoppel (e.g.,
in a dispute between the Parties that is not a Covered Claim), in which case
all filings with any court shall be sealed to the extent permissible by the
court. A Party (including such Partys counsel or other representatives) may
disclose to the media only the fact and generic nature of a Covered Claim that
is being, or has been, arbitrated pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 12.15_ is intended to, or shall, preclude a Party from communicating
with, or making disclosures to, its lawyers, tax advisors, auditors and
insurers, as necessary and appropriate or from making such other disclosures
as may be required by any stock exchange requirements or Law.

(k) _Fees and Costs_. The Parties shall share equally the fees of the
Arbitrator and Appellate Arbitrators and the administrative costs of the
arbitration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the prevailing party in the
arbitration as determined by the Arbitrator or the Appellate Arbitrators, as
applicable, shall be awarded its portion of such fees and costs as costs in
the arbitration.

12.16  _Attorneys  Fees_. Without limiting _Section 12.15_, if any Action
is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement or because of an alleged
dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the
provisions hereof, the successful or prevailing party as determined by the
Arbitrator or the Appellate Arbitrators, as applicable, shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in that
proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

12.17 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence for each and every
provision of this Agreement.

12.18 _References to U.S. Dollars_. All references in this Agreement to
amounts of money expressed in dollars are references to United States
dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

12.19 _No Offset_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 3.6_, the amount
payable to any Party under this Agreement shall not be subject to offset or
deduction, except as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

 

12.20 _No Rescission_. Following the Effective Time, no Party shall be
entitled to rescind the transactions contemplated hereby by virtue of any
failure of any Partys representations and warranties herein to have been true
or any failure by any Party to perform its obligations hereunder.

12.21 _Certain Matters Regarding Representation of the Company_. Sheppard,
Mullin, Richter and Hampton LLP (" _SMRH_ ") has acted as counsel for the
Company in connection with this Agreement (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ ")
and in that connection not as counsel for any other Person, including the
Shareholders, the SEU Holders and Buyer. SMRH has also represented on or prior
to the Closing, and may also thereafter represent, the Company in respect of
other matters (the " _Company Engagements_ ").

 

(a) _Acquisition Engagement_. Only the Company shall be considered a client of
SMRH in the Acquisition Engagement. All attorney-client communications
between the Company and SMRH in the course of, but only to the extent related
to, the Acquisition Engagement shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the 

 



-71-   Company prior to the Closing and shall belong solely to the Transaction
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders and the SEU Holders) on and
after the Closing and not the Company. Upon and after the Closing, (i) the
Transaction Representative and SMRH shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege to the extent relating to the Acquisition Engagement, and
neither the Company nor Buyer shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent
that files of SMRH relate to the Acquisition Engagement are subject to the
attorney-client privilege, and constitute property of the client, only the
Transaction Representative shall hold such property rights, and (iii) SMRH
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files with respect to the Acquisition Engagement to the
Company or Buyer by reason of any attorney-client relationship between SMRH
and the Company or otherwise.

(b) _Post-Closing Representation of the Shareholders and the SEU
Holders, Including Matters Relating to the Acquisition_. If the Shareholders
and/or the SEU Holders so desire, and without the need for any consent or
waiver by the Company or Buyer, SMRH shall be permitted to represent the
Shareholders and/or the SEU Holders after the Closing in connection with any
matter to the extent related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, SMRH shall be permitted
to represent the Shareholders and/or the SEU Holders, any of their agents and
Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation,
transaction or dispute ("dispute" includes litigation, arbitration,
mediation, negotiation or other adversary proceeding) with Buyer, the Company
or any of their agents or Affiliates to the extent related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such as claims
for indemnification and disputes involving employment or other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement).

(c) _Consent and Waiver of Conflicts of Interest_. The Company, Buyer and the
Transaction Representative consent to the arrangements in this Section and
waive any actual or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in
connection with any representation by SMRH permitted under this _Section
12.21_.

A. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (" _Parent_ "), the Company and the Surviving
Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), dated as of July 15, 2012, providing for certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement are
intended to be construed together to effectuate their purpose.

B. The Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company
have approved a merger pursuant to which the Surviving Company shall be
acquired by the Parent through a merger of the Company with and into the
Surviving Company, with the Surviving Company continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ ").

C. The Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and the
shareholders of the Company and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and
the Merger.

_AGREEMENT_ :

The parties hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Certain Definitions_.

(a) " _California Law_ " means the General Corporation Law of the State of
California.

(b) " _Surviving Company Common Stock_ " means the 10,000 authorized shares of
common stock of Surviving Company, no par value.

 

2\. _Surviving Company_. The Company shall be merged with and into Surviving
Company, and Surviving Company shall be the surviving company.

3\. _Effective Time_. The date and time when the Merger shall become effective
(the " _Effective Time_ ") shall be the time when this Agreement of Merger
and the attached Officers Certificates are filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of California.

4\. _Conversion of Stock_. At and as of the Effective Time, without any action
on the part of the holders thereof:

 



-1-  (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Surviving Company Common
Stock that is owned by Surviving Company (as treasury stock) or any wholly-
owned subsidiary of Surviving Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock of the Company shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of Surviving Company.

(c) _Conversion of Surviving Company Common Stock; Dissenting Shares_.

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Surviving Company Common Stock
(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 4(a) and other
than Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $[ ] for each
share of Surviving Company Common Stock.

(ii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 4(c)(i), shares of Surviving
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who (a) has not voted such shares of
Surviving Company Common Stock, or executed a written consent, in favor of the
Merger, (b) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to Section 1301 of California Law (" _Section 1301_ "), and
complies in all respects with the provisions of Section 1301, and (c) has not
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to demand relief as a dissenting
shareholder under California Law as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive cash as provided
in Section 4(c)(i), but instead such holder of Dissenting Shares shall only be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1301\. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist or be outstanding,
and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except such rights as are granted under Section 1301\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
1301, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1301, then the rights of such
holder under Section 1301 shall cease to exist and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the cash to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive as provided in Section 4(c)(i).

 

5\. _Company Is Disappearing Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the separate
existence of the Company shall cease, and Surviving Company shall succeed,

become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

shall be amended and restated in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto.

above, this Agreement of Merger shall forthwith become void and there shall be
no liability on the part of the Company or Surviving Company or their
respective officers or directors solely as a result of the termination of this
Agreement of Merger.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile

pursuant to Section 1201(b) of the California Corporations Code.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

In connection with the merger (the "Merger") of DKC Acquisition Corp. (the
"Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the
"Buyer"), with and into One Lambda, Inc. (the "Company"), pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 15, 2012 (as subsequently
modified, amended and supplemented, the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the
Buyer, the Merger Sub, the Company and Emiko Terasaki, M.D., as the
Transaction Representative, the undersigned acknowledges that the above
described shares (the "Shares") converted into the right to receive an initial
cash payment as described in the Merger Agreement, and potential additional
future cash payments. The undersigned hereby surrenders all certificates with
respect to such Shares (the "Certificates") and hereby instructs that all of
the Shares be exchanged for the undersigneds Pro Rata Share of the Adjusted
Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to which the
undersigned is entitled to be paid under Section 2.4(a) of the Merger
Agreement and, if applicable, future cash payments (subject to applicable
withholding contemplated by the Merger Agreement), payable pursuant to the
Merger, all as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Any such future cash
payments shall be without interest, except under the circumstances described
in Section 2.5 of the Merger Agreement.

 

By execution and delivery of this Payment Instruction Letter and the
Certificate(s) to the Paying Agent (as hereinafter defined) and accepting the
Merger consideration, the undersigned hereby (i) forever waives all
dissenters rights under applicable California law, (ii) withdraws all written
objections to the Merger and/or demands for appraisal, if any, with respect
to the shares of Company common stock (the "Shares") owned by the undersigned
and (iii) releases each of the Buyer, the Merger Sub and the Company from any
and all claims and liabilities related to the Merger consideration paid or
payable by the Buyer pursuant to the Merger.

The undersigned represents that the undersigned has full authority to
surrender the Shares, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances and
has no further equity interest or rights in the Company. The undersigned will,
upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents reasonably deemed
appropriate or necessary by the Paying Agent in connection with the surrender
of the Shares. All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this
Payment Instruction Letter shall be binding upon the successors, assigns,
heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives of the undersigned
and shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of
the undersigned. The surrender of Shares hereby is irrevocable.

 



-2-  The undersigned understands that surrender is not made in acceptable form
until the receipt by [ ] (the "Paying Agent") of the
Certificate(s) and this Payment Instruction Letter, or a facsimile hereof,
duly completed and signed, together with all accompanying evidences of
authority in form satisfactory to the Buyer (which may delegate power in whole
or in part to the Paying Agent). All questions as to validity, form and
eligibility of any surrender of Shares hereby will be determined by the Buyer
(which may delegate power in whole or in part to the Paying Agent) and such
determination shall be final and binding.

The undersigned understands that payment for surrendered Shares will be made
as promptly as practicable upon the later of (i) the Closing (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) and (ii) such date subsequent to the Closing as this
Payment Instruction Letter accompanied by the Certificates (or a Lost
Instrument Affidavit in respect of such Certificate(s)) is delivered to the
Paying Agent.

Please issue the check to which the undersigned is entitled in the name set
forth above and deliver such check to the address set forth above, unless
otherwise indicated under the Special Payment Instructions or Special
Delivery Instructions above.

PLEASE READ THIS PAYMENT INSTRUCTION LETTER AND THE ACCOMPANYING INSTRUCTIONS
CAREFULLY IN THEIR ENTIRETY. THIS PAYMENT INSTRUCTION LETTER (OR A COPY
HEREOF) AND ALL OTHER DOCUMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED HEREBY SHOULD BE
MAILED OR DELIVERED TO THE PAYING AGENT AS SET FORTH ABOVE. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED
ABOVE, NO INTEREST WILL ACCRUE ON ANY CASH PAYMENT DUE OR ON UNPAID DIVIDENDS
OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

-4-  INSTRUCTIONS

_1\. Delivery of Payment Instruction Letter._ This Payment Instruction Letter
or a facsimile hereof, filled in and signed by the record holder(s) of the
certificate(s) representing Shares listed on the first page of this Payment
Instruction Letter (unless the listed certificate(s) have been transferred or
assigned prior to the Merger, see Instruction 3 below), together with the
Certificate(s) and Form W-9 and California Franchise Tax Board Form 590, must
be received by the Paying Agent, in satisfactory form, in order to make an
effective surrender of the Shares. Delivery of the Payment Instruction Letter,
the Certificate(s) and Form W-9 and California Franchise Tax Board Form 590,

upon proper delivery of the Payment Instruction Letter together with the
Certificate(s) and Form W-9 California Franchise Tax Board Form 590 to the

_2\. Terms of Conversion of the Shares._ As of the Effective Time (as defined
in the Merger Agreement), each Share was converted into the right to receive,
without interest (except as provided in Section 2.5 of the Merger Agreement),
and subject to applicable withholding, such holders Pro Rata Share of the
Adjusted Merger Consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement. __

_3\. Guarantee of Signature._ Signature guarantees are unnecessary unless the
registered holder completes the Special Payment Instructions or Special
Delivery Instructions. If such instructions are completed, the signature on

surrendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the exact name(s)

If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are held of record by two or more
joint owners, all such owners must sign this Payment Instruction Letter.

If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are registered in different names on
several entries in the Companys stock ledger, it will be necessary to
complete, sign and submit as many separate Payment Instruction Letters as
there are different registrations in the Companys stock ledger. 

If this Payment Instruction Letter is signed by a trustee, executor,

to be issued to any person(s) other than the registered holder(s) of the
surrendered Shares, it shall be a condition of the issuance and delivery of
such check that the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s) or such person(s)) payable on account of the
transfer (or transfers) of the surrendered Shares shall be delivered to the
Paying Agent or satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes or
nonapplicability thereof shall be submitted to the Paying Agent before such

and such determination shall be final and binding. The Buyer reserves the
right to waive any irregularities or defects in the surrender of any Shares,
and its interpretations of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and of this Payment Instruction Letter (including these instructions) with
respect to such irregularities or defects shall be final and binding. A
surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities have

the undersigned documentation necessary to be completed in order to surrender
such lost or destroyed Certificate(s) and receive the Adjusted Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor. __

_9\. Requests for Information or Additional Copies_

 



-5-  Information and additional copies of this Notice and Payment Instruction
Letter may be obtained from the Paying Agent by writing to the address on the
front of this Payment Instruction Letter or by calling the Paying Agent at [
]. 

_10\. Inadequate Space_

If the space provided on this Payment Instruction Letter is inadequate,
additional information should be listed on a separate signed schedule affixed
hereto.

 

 _11\. Payment Instruction Letter Required_

You will not receive any cash for your Shares unless and until you deliver
this Payment Instruction Letter or a facsimile hereof, duly completed and
signed, to the Paying Agent, and any required accompanying evidences of
authority in form satisfactory to the Buyer. No interest will be paid on
amounts due for the Shares, except as provided above.

_12\. Form W-9 and California Franchise Tax Board Form 590._

Each stockholder surrendering Shares for payment is required to provide the
Paying Agent with a correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") and certain
other information on an IRS Form W-9 and California Franchise Tax Board Form
590, as described below. Payments of cash made for shares surrendered with
this Payment Instruction Letter will be reported to the Internal Revenue
Service as required by the statutes currently in effect.

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

United States federal income tax law generally requires that if your shares
are accepted for payment, you or your assignee (in either case, the "Payee"),
must provide the Paying Agent (the "Payor") with the Payees correct Taxpayer
Identification Number ("TIN"), which, in the case of a Payee who is an
individual, is the Payees social security number. If the Payor is not
provided with the correct TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, the Payee
may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") and backup withholding in an amount equal to 28% of the gross proceeds
received pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, the tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding will be
reduced by the amount withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of
taxes, a refund may be obtained by timely furnishing the required information
to the IRS.

 

To prevent backup withholding, each Payee must provide such Payees correct
TIN by completing the enclosed Form W-9, certifying that (i) the TIN provided
is correct, (ii) (a) the Payee is exempt from backup withholding, (b) the
Payee has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such Payee is
subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest
or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified the Payee that such Payee is no
longer subject to backup withholding, and (iii) the Payee is a U.S. Person
(including a U.S. resident alien).

 

If the Payee does not have a TIN, such Payee should consult the instructions
on the enclosed Form W-9 (the "W-9 Specific Instructions") for instructions
on applying for a TIN and apply for a TIN immediately. If the Payee does not
provide such Payees TIN to the Payor by the time of payment, backup
withholding will apply.

 

If the Shares are held in more than one name or are not in the name of the
actual owner, consult the W-9 Specific Instructions for information on which
TIN to report.

In addition to an IRS Form W-9, each Payee must provide a completed and signed
California Franchise Tax Board Form 590 in order to avoid any California
backup tax withholding or withholding on domestic nonresidents of California
that may otherwise apply. Such California tax withholding is imposed at a rate
of 7%.

 

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT YOUR TAX CONSULTANT OR THE INTERNAL REVENUE
SERVICE.

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in consideration of the
foregoing, and intending to be legally bound and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



-1-  1\. _Appointment of the Escrow Agent_. Buyer and the Transaction
Representative hereby appoint U.S. Bank, National Association as the Escrow
Agent to receive, hold, administer and deliver the Escrow Fund (as defined
below) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the
Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment, all subject to and upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein.

2\. _Establishment of Escrow Fund; Rights to Escrow Fund_.

(a) Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has deposited
with the Escrow Agent Sixty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($67,500,000) in cash (the " _Initial Escrow Amount_ "). Buyer shall deposit
additional amounts in escrow in accordance with the provisions of Sections
2.5(b) and 2.5(d) of the Merger Agreement (the " _Additional Escrow Deposits_
"). Any and all earnings, dividends, interest and other income on the Escrow
Amount and the Additional Escrow Deposits which from time to time may be held
by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Escrow Earnings_." The Escrow Amount, the Additional Escrow Deposits
and the Escrow Earnings (collectively, the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be held by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
herein. It is the parties intention that the Escrow Agent shall dispose of
the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the express provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, none of Buyer, the
Transaction Representative, the Shareholders or the SEU Holders shall have
any right, title or interest in or possession of any of the Escrow Fund.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) no such Person shall
have the ability to pledge, convey, hypothecate or grant a security interest
in any portion of the Escrow Fund unless and until such portion of the Escrow
Fund shall have been disbursed to such Person in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and (ii) until the Escrow Fund shall have been
disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall be in sole possession of the Escrow Fund and will not act or be
deemed to act as custodian for any party hereto for purposes of perfecting a
security interest therein. Accordingly, no Person shall have any right to
have or to hold any of the Escrow Fund as collateral for any obligation and
shall not be able to obtain a security interest in any assets (tangible or
intangible) contained in or relating to any of the Escrow Fund. In addition,
the SEU Holders have no interest in the Escrow Fund or amounts distributed to
the Company or Buyer for further distribution to SEU Holders, it being the
agreement and intention of the parties that the SEU Holders shall be solely
unsecured general creditors of the Company.

3\. _Investment of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent
shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Fund as Buyer and the Transaction
Representative shall jointly direct in a written notice to the Escrow Agent
which is executed by Buyer and the Transaction Representative (each such joint
notice, a " _Joint Written Direction_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that all
such investments and reinvestments shall be made in one or more of the
following:

(a) direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the
principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the
United States of America, in either case, maturing within one (1) year from
the date of purchase;

 



-2-  (b) certificates of deposit issued by any United States bank, bank and trust
company, or national banking association (including the Escrow Agent and its
affiliates) with capital in excess of One Hundred Million Dollars
($100,000,000), which certificates of deposit are insured by the United States
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ ") or a similar governmental
agency and mature within one hundred and eighty (180) days;

 

(c) money market mutual funds rated in one of the two highest rating
categories assigned by Standard and Poors Corporation or Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. for obligations of such nature; and/or

(d) FDIC-insured money market accounts of U.S. Bank, National Association.

The initial investment of the Escrow Fund shall be as indicated in _Exhibit
D_ hereto and shall so remain unless the Escrow Agent is otherwise instructed
by a Joint Written Direction. Absent a Joint Written Direction, the Escrow
Agent will automatically invest in the investments set forth under clause (d)
above. Any investment hereunder shall be made in the name of the Escrow
Agent. Earnings, interest and income on investments shall be added to the
Escrow Fund. Any loss or expense incurred as a result of any investment shall
be paid from the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Escrow Agent may, without giving advance notice to Buyer
or the Transaction Representative, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing
investments at any time if the proceeds thereof are required for any release
of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund permitted or required hereunder. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of any
investment in an investment indicated in clauses (a) through (d) above, on 
_Exhibit D_, in any Joint Written Direction, as a result of any liquidation
of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the parties
hereto to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow
Fund. The Escrow Agent shall provide periodic statements to Buyer and the
Transaction Representative reflecting all transactions executed on behalf of
the Escrow Fund. In addition, upon written request by, and at no additional
cost to, Buyer and/or the Transaction Representative, the Escrow Agent shall
promptly provide Buyer and the Transaction Representative a statement of
transaction details upon completion of any securities transaction in the
Escrow Fund.

 

4\. _Release of the Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Fund
until it releases the Escrow Fund as provided in this  _Section 4_, as
follows:

(a) In order for Buyer to make a claim on the Escrow Fund, Buyer shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent and the Transaction Representative a written notice
describing in reasonable detail, to the extent then known, (i) the facts
giving rise to the claim for indemnification under the Merger Agreement, (ii)
the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and
(iii) a reference to the provision of the Merger Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed thereunder or in connection
therewith upon which such claim is based. A written notice delivered in
accordance with the foregoing is referred to herein as an " _Escrow Claim_."
If the Transaction Representative has not, within thirty (30) days following
Buyers delivery of the Escrow Claim, notified Buyer and the Escrow Agent in
writing that the Transaction Representative disputes the Escrow Claim, in
whole or in part, then the Escrow Agent shall, at the end of the five (5)
Business Day period following such thirty (30) day period, remit to Buyer
from the Escrow Fund the amount set forth in the Escrow

 



-3-   Claim. If the Transaction Representative has, within thirty (30) days
following Buyers delivery of the Escrow Claim, given written notice (each a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer and the Escrow Agent that it disputes the Escrow
Claim, in whole or in part, then (a) the Escrow Agent shall not pay out any
portion of the Escrow Fund in dispute until otherwise notified in a Joint
Written Direction or pursuant to  _Section 4(d)(i)_ below and (B) any
amounts not in dispute shall be remitted to Buyer by the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Fund as soon as possible (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Dispute Notice.

(b) Within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of all
adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.6 of the Merger
Agreement which results in a net amount payable to Buyer, the Escrow Agent
shall release from escrow and deliver to Buyer the amount (i) mutually agreed
upon by Buyer and the Transaction Representative in a Joint Written Direction
or (ii) finally determined by the Accounting Arbitrator, as the case may be.
In the case of a final determination by the Accounting Arbitrator, and Buyer
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the written determination of the Accounting
Arbitrator and shall provide a copy thereof to the Transaction Representative

(c) Release of Escrow upon Escrow Termination Date.

(1) Within five (5) Business Days after [ ] (the " _Escrow
Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release from escrow and deliver
to each Shareholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to (i) such Shareholders Proportionate Share of the then
remaining balance, if any, of the Escrow Fund _less_ (ii) such Shareholders
Proportionate Share of the amount reserved for payment of any then-pending
Escrow Claims equal to the aggregate amounts set forth in all such then-
pending Escrow Claims.

(2) Within five (5) Business Days after the Escrow Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release from escrow and deliver to the Company (for further
distribution to the SEU Holders as provided in _Section 4(e)_), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to (i) all of the
SEU Holders Proportionate Shares of the then remaining balance, if any, of
the Escrow Fund _less_ (ii) all of the SEU Holders Proportionate Shares of
the amount reserved for payment of any then-pending Escrow Claims equal to
the aggregate amounts set forth in all such then-pending Escrow Claims.

(3) Following the Escrow Termination Date, upon final resolution of any
pending Escrow Claim in accordance with this _Section 4_, Buyer and the
Transaction Representative shall promptly deliver a Joint Written Direction
to the Escrow Agent, and upon receipt of such Joint Written Direction, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release to, or as directed by, Buyer or the
Transaction Representative, as set forth in the Joint Written Direction, that
portion of the Escrow Fund reserved for payment of such Escrow Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to Escrow Claims resolved in favor
of the Shareholders and the SEU Holders, the Escrow Agent shall release such
portion of the Escrow Fund only to the extent that there remain sufficient
amounts in the Escrow Fund to satisfy any remaining Escrow Claims. Following
the Escrow Termination Date and the final resolution of all Escrow Claims in

 



-4-   accordance with this _Section 4_ (including payments, if any, to be made to
Buyer), the Escrow Agent shall (i) release to each Shareholder such
Shareholders Proportionate Share of the balance, if any, of the Escrow Fund
and (ii) release to the Company (for further distribution to the SEU Holders
as provided in _Section 4(e)_), an amount equal to all of the SEU Holders
Proportionate Shares of the balance, if any of the Escrow Fund.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 

(i) if at any time the Escrow Agent receives either a final non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a final non-appealable order of
the Appellate Arbitrators (as attached to a Joint Written Direction that
states that such order constitutes either of the foregoing, a " _Final Order_
"), which order, in either case, resolves any portion of an Escrow Claim in
favor of Buyer, then the Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, all or any portion, as the case may
be, of the Escrow Fund in compliance with such Final Order upon receipt
by the Escrow Agent of a copy of such Final Order;

(ii) if at any time the Escrow Agent receives a Final Order which
resolves any portion of an Escrow Claim in favor of the Shareholders and/or
the SEU Holders, then such portion of the Escrow Claim shall no longer be
deemed pending and, if the Escrow Agent has received such Final Order on or
following the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (i)
deliver to each Shareholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
such Shareholders Proportionate Share of the amount equal to the amount
reserved for payment of that portion of the Escrow Claim and (ii) deliver to
the Company (for further distribution to the SEU Holders as provided in
_Section 4(e)_), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all of the
SEU Holders Proportionate Share of the amount equal to the amount reserved
for payment of that portion of the Escrow Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to Escrow Claims resolved in favor of the Shareholders and the
SEU Holders, the Escrow Agent shall release such portion of the Escrow Fund
only to the extent that there remain sufficient amounts in the Escrow Fund to
satisfy any remaining Escrow Claims;

(iii) if within fifteen (15) days before the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing there is any amount remaining in the Escrow Fund, each Shareholder and
SEU Holder shall have the right to request from Buyer that such Shareholders
or SEU Holders Proportionate Share of such remaining amount be released in
exchange for such Shareholder or SEU Holder substituting collateral
satisfactory to Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion. Upon receipt of a
Joint Written Direction confirming that Buyer has approved such substitute
collateral, the Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver to such Shareholder or the
Company (for further distribution to such SEU Holder as provided in _Section
4(e)_), as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to such Shareholders or SEU Holders Proportionate Share of
such remaining amount; and

 

(iv) if the Escrow Agent receives a Joint Written Direction for the
disbursement of funds from the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
disburse all or any portion of the Escrow Fund in accordance with such Joint
Written Direction.

 



-5-  (e) Upon its receipt of any amounts under this _Section 4_, the Company
shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, deduct and withhold therefrom
the amounts required by _Section 16(d)_ and promptly pay to each SEU Holder
such SEU Holders Pro Rata Share of the balance thereof.

 

5\. _Compensation of the Escrow Agent_. Buyer and the Transaction
Representative shall each pay the Escrow Agent one half (1/2) of the amounts
set forth on _Exhibit E_ attached hereto as payment for the services of the
Escrow Agent to be rendered hereunder and to reimburse the Escrow Agents fees
and expenses.

 

6\. _Obligations and Liabilities of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent
undertakes to perform only such duties and obligations as are expressly set
forth herein and no other duties or obligations shall be implied. The Escrow
Agent shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the
provisions of any agreement other than this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
have no obligation to recognize, and shall not have any liability and
responsibility arising under, any agreement to which the Escrow Agent is not a
party, even though reference thereto may be made herein (including the Merger
Agreement, except that the Escrow Agent shall be required to refer to the
Merger Agreement for certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not
defined herein). With respect to the Escrow Agents responsibility, Buyer and
the Transaction Representative further agree that:

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no liability or obligation with respect to the
Escrow Fund, except arising out of, relating to or in connection with the
Escrow Agents willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence. The Escrow Agents
sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping, investment and disbursement
of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall have no implied duties or obligations and shall not be charged
with knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set
forth herein. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal
action or commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Fund, any
account in which the Escrow Fund is deposited, this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement, or to prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with Final Orders with respect to
the Escrow Fund. If any portion of the Escrow Fund is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order or order of the Arbitrator or
Appellate Arbitrator, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any
such order, or in case any such order shall be made or entered affecting such
property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to rely upon and comply with any such order which it is reasonably
advised by its legal counsel, whether internal or external, is a Final Order.

(c) The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or
refraining from acting upon any written notice, instruction or request
furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be
under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or
content of any such document. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit
any payments which may be due to it or the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for 

 



-6-   any action taken or omitted by it in good faith, except to the extent that a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agents willful
misconduct, bad faith or negligence was the cause of any loss to Buyer or to
the Transaction Representative. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers
and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through agents or
attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful selection of any such
agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled
persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it
in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or
other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain
as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or
demands from any party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the
provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any
action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in
escrow until it shall be directed otherwise by a Joint Written Direction or
by a Final Order. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action.

7\. _Successor Escrow Agent_.

(a) The Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time resign
as such by delivering not less than thirty (30) days advance notice of its
resignation to Buyer and the Transaction Representative specifying a date when
such resignation shall take effect and delivering the Escrow Fund to a
successor Escrow Agent jointly designated by Buyer and the Transaction
Representative in writing. The Escrow Agents resignation shall not be
effective until: (i) such appointment of the successor Escrow Agent has
been made, (ii) the Escrow Fund has been delivered to the successor Escrow
Agent, and (iii) the successor Escrow Agents acceptance of this Agreement and
receipt for the Escrow Fund from the successor Escrow Agent and copies thereof
shall have been sent to Buyer and the Transaction Representative. The Escrow
Agent may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Escrow Agent if one is not designated by Buyer and the Transaction
Representative within sixty (60) days of receipt of such resignation from the
Escrow Agent.

(b) Any Person into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any Person to which all or substantially all
the escrow business of the Escrow Agents corporate trust services business
(including the administration of the Escrow Fund) may be transferred, shall
be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

8\. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered (a) when
delivered personally, against written receipt or upon written notice of
rejection, (b) if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt

-8-   inquiry that such document was received by such other person on the same
date on which it was received by the Escrow Agent.

 

9\. _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which may be determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction. It is expressly understood, however, that the
parties hereto intend each and every provision of this Agreement to be valid
and enforceable and hereby knowingly waive all rights to object to any
provision of this Agreement.

10\. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
and shall not be enforceable by or inure to the benefit of any third party. No
party hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that the
Escrow Agent may assign this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 7(b)_ without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto.

11\. _Amendments_. This Agreement may only be modified or terminated by a
writing signed by all of the parties hereto, and no waiver hereunder shall be

Agreement shall terminate automatically without any action by the parties
hereto upon delivery of all of the Escrow Fund as provided in _Section 4_.

12\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
may be executed and delivered in counterpart signature pages and delivered via
facsimile transmission or email with scan or facsimile attachment, and any
such counterpart executed and delivered via facsimile or email transmission
shall be deemed an original for all intents and purposes. The Escrow Agent
shall be provided with an original, non-facsimile, fully-executed document
for its records.

13\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
under the laws of the State of Delaware for contracts entered into and to be
performed solely within such state without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the state of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware. No party hereto shall
be liable to any other party hereto for losses due to, or if it is unable to
perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of, acts of
God, fire, floods, strikes, equipment or transmission failure or other causes
reasonably beyond its control.

14\. _Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue_. In the event that any party hereto
commences a lawsuit or other proceeding relating to or arising from this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree that the federal or state courts located
in the State of California shall have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction over
any such proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that as between Buyer and the
Transaction Representative, the provisions of  _Section 12.15_ of the Merger
Agreement shall control. Any of these courts shall be proper venue for any
such lawsuit or other proceeding and

 



-9-   the parties hereto irrevocably waive any objection on the grounds of venue,
forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds. The parties hereto consent to and
agree to submit to the jurisdiction of any of the courts specified herein and
agree to accept service of process to vest personal jurisdiction over them in
any of these courts by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law.

 

15\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties hereto relating to the holding, investment and disbursement of
the Escrow Fund and sets forth in their entirety the obligations, duties and
rights of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Fund and otherwise
hereunder.

 

16\. _Tax Matters_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all Escrow
Earnings, if any, attributable to the Escrow Fund or any other amount held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated to
Buyer. Buyer and the Transaction Representative, on her own behalf and on
behalf of the Company, the Shareholders and the SEU Holders, hereby agree not
to report any other item of interest income or expense (including original
issue discount or imputed interest) with respect to the Escrow Fund or any
distribution thereof, except pursuant to a final determination pursuant to
Section 1313(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. 

(b) Each party hereto hereby represents that its correct Taxpayer
Identification Number assigned by the United States Internal Revenue Service
or any other taxing authority will be as set forth in the documentation
delivered by such party to the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 19_.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall report and withhold any taxes as it determines may
be required by any law or regulation in effect at the time of the
distribution.

 

(d) With respect to any portion of the Escrow Funds released to the Company,
the Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, promptly deduct and
withhold therefrom such amounts that are required under applicable law to be
deducted or withheld by the Company or any other person as employer or
withholding agent in connection therewith (collectively, the "
_SEU Withholdings_ "). The Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company
to, pay the SEU Withholdings to the applicable taxing authorities. The SEU
Withholdings shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to each SEU Holder in respect of whom such deduction or withholding
was made.

(e) Buyer and the Transaction Representative shall make available to the
Escrow Agent any additional information necessary for it to comply with this
_Section 16_.

17.  _Security Procedures_. In the event funds transfer instructions are
given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow
Agreement, as indicated in _Exhibit F_ attached hereto), whether in writing,
by facsimile or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons set forth in _Section 9_, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of any person or persons purporting to be the person or persons
so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for

 



-10-   call-backs may be changed only in a notice actually received and
acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any
of the authorized representatives identified in  _Section 9_, then, in the
case of Buyer, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of
such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of the executive
officers (collectively, " _Executive Officers_ ") of Buyer, which shall
include the title of General Counsel, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such
Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed
Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation
of any person purporting to be any such Executive Officer. The Escrow Agent
and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any
account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Buyer or
the Transaction Representative to identify: (a) the beneficiary, (b) the
beneficiarys bank or (c) any intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply
any portion of the Escrow Fund for any payment order it executes using any
such identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other than
the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the
beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank designated. The parties hereto
acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

18\. _U.S.A. Patriot Act Information_. Buyer and the
Transaction Representative shall provide to the Escrow Agent such information
regarding Buyer and the Transaction Representative, respectively, as the
Escrow Agent may reasonably require to permit the Escrow Agent to comply with
its obligations under the federal USA PATRIOT Act (Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001). The Escrow Agent shall not credit any amount of
interest or investment proceeds earned on the Escrow Fund, or make any
payment of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund, to any person unless and until
such person has provided to the Escrow Agent such documents as the Escrow
Agent may require to permit the Escrow Agent to comply with its
obligations under such Act.

19\. _Tax Reporting Documentation_. Within thirty (30) days after the
execution of this Agreement: (a) Buyer shall provide to the Escrow Agent
Buyers certified tax identification number on Form W-9 (or Form W-8 if Buyer
is a non-U.S. person) and such other forms and documents as the Escrow Agent
may reasonably request (collectively, " _Tax Reporting Documentation_ ") and
(b) the Transaction Representative shall provide to the Escrow Agent Tax
Reporting Documentation for each Shareholder and SEU Holder. The parties
hereto understand that, if such Tax Reporting Documentation is not so
delivered to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be required by the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to withhold a portion of any
interest or other income earned on the investment of monies or other property
held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement.

such exceptions created by, through or under the Tenant, each such matter
shall be deemed to be a Required Title Clearance Matter. In addition to
Required Title Clearance Matters, Seller shall be obligated to use
commercially reasonable efforts to discharge or remove from title, or, in the
event such matters were created by, through or under Tenant, to cause Tenant
to discharge or remove from title, prior to Closing all matters which would in

conduct of the Buyers intended business operations at the Property or (b)
have a material adverse impact on the value of the Property, but specifically
excluding the Leases (collectively, the "Material Title Objections"). Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any Material Title Objections as soon as is

the event Seller fails to cause the Material Title Objections to be discharged
prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at
any time prior to Closing upon the delivery of written notice to Seller (a
"Material Title Termination Notice"), in which event (i) this Agreement shall
be null and void and neither party shall have any further obligation to the
other, except as expressly set forth herein, and (ii) at the closing of the
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Seller shall be obligated to
execute and deliver, and cause the Tenant to execute and deliver, one (1)

Buyer, in its sole discretion, in all respects. If Buyer finds the Property
to be unacceptable and elects not to proceed with the transaction contemplated
hereby, Buyer shall have right to terminate this Agreement for any or no
reason as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion by written notice to
such effect given to Seller and Escrow Holder at any time prior to the

_ARTICLE 6: PRORATIONS; COSTS_

6.1 _Prorations_. Not less than five (5) business days prior to Closing,
Seller shall provide to Buyer such information and verification reasonably
necessary to support the prorations under this _Article 5_. The items in this
_Section 6.1_ shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Closing Date
being a day of income and expense to Buyer. Credits to Buyer shall be credited
against the Purchase Price to be paid as provided in _Section 1.3_ and, if
such amount is exhausted, shall be paid in cash by Seller to Buyer at the
Closing. Post-closing re-prorations and adjustments shall be paid in cash.

(a)  _Taxes and Assessments_. Buyer shall receive a credit for any accrued
but unpaid real estate taxes and assessments (" _Taxes_ ") (including without
limitation any assessments imposed by private covenant) applicable to any
period before the Closing Date, even if such taxes and assessments are not
yet due and payable, but only to the extent any such amounts are not otherwise
required to be paid by the tenants under any Leases. Buyer shall receive from
Seller a credit for any special assessments which are levied or charged
against the Property with respect to any infrastructure improvements
specifically made to serve the Property, whether or not then due and payable
(but excluding any special assessments payable in installments to the extent
any such installment is not yet due and payable), but only to the extent any
such amounts are not otherwise required to be paid by the tenants under any
Leases. Any other special assessments not otherwise required to be paid by
the tenants under any Leases shall be prorated only for the year of Closing.
The credit received under this _Section 6.1(a)_ shall not be duplicative of
any credit received under _Section 6.1(c)_ which is specifically allocable
to such items.

(b) _Collected Rent_. Buyer shall receive from Seller a credit for any rent
and other income (and any applicable state or local tax on rent) under Leases
collected by Seller before Closing that applies to any period after Closing.
Uncollected rent and other uncollected income shall not be prorated at

Buyer from a tenant, first to the costs of such collection, then to such
tenants current monthly rental and then to arrearages in the reverse order in
which they were due, remitting to Seller, any balance properly allocable to
Sellers period of ownership. Buyer shall bill and use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect such rent arrearages in the ordinary course of business,
but shall not be obligated to engage a collection agency or take legal action
to collect any rent arrearages. Seller shall not have the right to seek
collection of any rents or other income applicable to any period before the
Closing. Any rent or other income received by Seller after 

 



-15-   Closing which are owed to Buyer shall be held in trust and remitted to Buyer
promptly after receipt for allocation and disbursement as provided in this
_Section 6.1(b)_.

 

(c) _Tenant Deposits_. All tenant security deposits (and interest thereon if
required by law or contract to be earned thereon) shall be transferred or
credited to Buyer at Closing. As of Closing, Buyer shall assume Sellers
obligations related to tenant security deposits, but only to the extent they
are properly credited and transferred to Buyer. In the event any discrepancy
in the amount of a security deposit between _Appendix 6.1(c)_ or the
applicable Lease, proration shall be based upon the higher amount.

(d) _Other Revenues and Income_. At Closing, Seller shall pay to or at the
direction of Buyer any and all revenues and income in connection with the
operation at the Property not covered above and collected by or on behalf of
Seller before the Closing and applicable to Buyers period of ownership, and
if such amount cannot be determined at Closing, such payment shall be based
upon an estimate. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to make a final
determination of such amount and make an appropriate adjusting payment within
thirty (30) days after Closing. In addition, each party shall promptly remit
or cause to be remitted to the other any such revenues and income collected by
such party after Closing and applicable to the other partys period of
ownership.

6.2 _Post-Closing Corrections_. Either party shall be entitled to a post-
Closing adjustment for any incorrect proration or adjustment, provided such
adjustment is claimed by such party within one year after Closing. No other
expense related to the ownership or operation of the Property shall be charged
to or paid or assumed by Buyer under this Agreement, other than those
obligations expressly assumed by Buyer.

6.3  _Utilities_. Except for utilities which are in the name of and billed
directly to tenants, Seller shall cause the meters, if any, for utilities to
be read the day on which the Closing Date occurs and to pay the bills rendered
on the basis of such readings. If any such meter reading for any utility is
not available, then adjustment therefor shall be made on the basis of the most
recently issued bills therefor which are based on meter readings no earlier
than thirty (30) days before the Closing Date; and such adjustment shall be
reprorated when the next utility bills are received. The credit received under
this _Section 6.3_ shall not be duplicative of any credit received under 
_Section 6.1(c)_ which is specifically allocable to such items.

6.4 _Service Contracts_. Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall receive a
credit for regular charges under Accepted Service Contracts paid and
applicable to Buyers period of ownership or payable and applicable to
Sellers period of ownership, respectively. Seller shall pay at Closing all
amounts owing under those Service Contracts that are not Accepted Service
Contracts.

6.5  _Costs_. Buyer shall pay (i) one-half of the Escrow Agents escrow fee,
closing charges and any cancellation fee, (ii) one-half of the cost of the
Title Commitment, the Survey and the Endorsements (including
extended coverage), and (iii) the costs associated with Buyers due diligence
activities. Seller shall pay (i) one-half of the Escrow Agents escrow fee,
closing charges and any cancellation fee, (ii) the cost of the Title
Policy (standard coverage), one-half of the cost of the Title Commitment and
the Endorsements (including extended coverage), and if

 



-16-   Closing occurs, one-half of the cost of the Survey, and (iii) all recording
fees or other charges incurred in connection with clearing title, including
without limitation any prepayment or release fees. Each party shall be
responsible for their own attorneys and other professional fees.

6.6  _Sales, Transfer, and Documentary Taxes_. All sales, gross receipts,
compensating, stamp, excise, documentary, transfer, deed or similar taxes and
fees imposed in connection with this transaction under applicable state or
county law shall be paid by Seller and such tax imposed by local ordinance

for such payment. Seller and Buyer shall execute any applicable city, county
and state transfer tax or other declarations.

6.7 _Utility Deposits_. Seller shall receive a credit for the amount of
deposits, if any, with utility companies that are transferable and that are
assigned to Buyer at the Closing.

6.8 _Sales Commissions_. Seller and Buyer represent and warrant each to the
other that they have not dealt with any real estate broker, sales person or
finder in connection with this transaction. Except as expressly set forth
above, in the event of any claim for brokers or finders fees or commissions
in connection with the negotiation, execution or consummation of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the other party from and against any such claim
based upon any actual or alleged statement, representation or agreement of the
indemnifying party. This provision shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 

6.9 _Wages_. Buyer shall not be liable for any wages, fringe benefits, payroll
taxes, unemployment insurance contributions, accrued vacation pay, accrued
pay for unused sick leave, accrued severance pay and other compensation
accruing before Closing for the Employees. Buyer shall not be liable for any
obligations accruing before Closing under any union contract or multi-
employer pension plan applicable to any such Employees or arising from the
termination of any such Employees at or prior to Closing.

satisfied or waived), Buyer shall be entitled to such remedies for breach of

limitation, the remedy of specific performance. If, after Sellers default,
Buyer elects not to proceed with the Closing, then Seller will, on demand,
reimburse Buyer for all expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with this
Agreement, including all due diligence expenses. Any default by Tenant
under the Merger Agreement shall be deemed to be a default of Seller
hereunder.

8.2 _Buyer s Default_. If this transaction fails to close due to the default
of Buyer (all conditions to Buyers obligations having been satisfied or
waived), then Sellers sole remedy in such event shall be to terminate this
Agreement, Seller waiving all other rights or remedies in the event of such
default by Buyer. Any default by DKC Acquisition Corp. under the Merger
Agreement shall be deemed to be a default of Buyer hereunder.

8.3 _Other Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated due to the default of a
party, then the defaulting party shall pay any fees due to the Escrow Agent
and any fees due to the Title Company for cancellation of the Title
Commitment.

8.4 _Termination of Merger Agreement_. In the event the Merger Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then this Agreement shall simultaneously terminate
without the need for further action by either party, in which event this
Agreement shall be null and void and neither party shall have any
further obligation to the other.

_ARTICLE 9: INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.1 _Seller s Indemnity_. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
harmless from any liability, claim, demand, loss, expense or damage
(collectively, " _loss_ ") that is: (a)

 



-20-   asserted by any person or entity against Buyer arising from any act or
omission of Seller, its agents, employees or contractors or otherwise arising
out of the ownership or operation of the Property first arising or occurring
prior to the Closing (but specifically excluding any such loss arising out of
the use or operation of the Property by the Tenant first arising or occurring
prior to the Closing); or (b) arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any
of Sellers representations and warranties set forth herein or (c) arising
from any breach by Seller of any obligation related to the Property other than
those obligations which by this Agreement, or any closing delivery,
specifically becomes the obligation of Buyer.

9.2 _Buyer s Indemnity_. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless of and from any loss that is: (a) asserted by any person or entity
against, Seller arising from any act or omission of Buyer or the Tenant, their
respective agents, employees or contractors or otherwise arising out of the
ownership or operation of the Property first arising or occurring on or after
the Closing; or (b) arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any of Buyers
representations or warranties set forth herein or (c) arising from any breach
by Buyer of any obligation of Buyer related to the Property which by this
Agreement, or any closing delivery, specifically becomes the obligation of
Buyer.

 

9.3 _Procedure_. The following provisions govern all actions for indemnity
under this Article 8 and any other provision of this Agreement. Promptly
after receipt by an indemnitee of notice of any claim, such indemnitee will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnitor, deliver to
the indemnitor written notice thereof and the indemnitor shall have the right
to participate in and, if the indemnitor agrees in writing that it will be
responsible for any costs, expenses, judgments, damages, and losses incurred
by the indemnitee with respect to such claim, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and
expenses to be paid by the indemnitee, if the indemnitee reasonably
believes that representation of such indemnitee by the counsel retained by
the indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between such indemnitee and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding. The failure of indemnitee to deliver written
notice to the indemnitor within a reasonable time after indemnitee receives
notice of any such claim shall relieve such indemnitor of any liability to the
indemnitee under this indemnity only if and to the extent that such failure
is prejudicial to the indemnitors ability to defend such action, and the
omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnitor will not relieve it of
any liability that it may have to any indemnitee other than under this
indemnity. If an indemnitee settles a claim without the prior written consent
of the indemnitor, then the indemnitor shall be released from liability with
respect to such claim unless the indemnitor has unreasonably withheld such
consent. 

9.4 _Survivability_. The obligations of the parties under this _Article 9_
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the Survival Period. Seller
and Buyer shall have the right to bring an action for indemnification
hereunder if they give the other party written notice of the circumstances
giving rise to the indemnified claim within said Survival Period, and have
brought an action thereon within six (6) months of the expiration of said
Survival Period.

 _LANDLORD ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE AND LEASE AMENDMENT_

The undersigned LAMBDA PROPERTIES, LLC, a California limited liability company
("Landlord") hereby delivers this Landlord Estoppel Certificate and Lease
Amendment (this "Certificate") as of , 2012, certifying
to and agreeing with ONE LAMBDA, INC., a California corporation ("Tenant") as
follows:

1\. Landlord is the landlord under that certain "Standard
Industrial/Commercial Single-Tenant LeaseNet" with Tenant, dated as of June
5, 2001, as amended by Amendment dated as of March 31, 2008 and that certain
renewal notice from Tenant to Landlord dated as of February 1, 2011 (as so
amended, and as amended herein, the "Lease"), affecting certain real property
(the "Property") located at 6709 Independence Avenue, Canoga Park, California,
as more particularly described in the Lease. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Lease.

2\. The Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified, amended
or supplemented in any way, except as set forth above. Landlord is holding a
security deposit under the Lease in the amount of $20,250.00.

3\. Tenant is not in default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of the Lease and no event has occurred and no situation exists which would,
with the passage of time, or the giving of notice or both, constitute a
default by the Tenant under the Lease.

4\. The term of the Lease is currently set to expire on March 31, 2014.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees (a) the term of the Lease shall be and hereby is extended to
December 31, 2020, and (b) Tenant shall have the right to terminate the Lease
prior to the then-scheduled expiration date, which right shall be exercisable
by Tenant upon the delivery of at least twelve (12) months prior written
notice to Landlord any time after September 1, 2014. 

5\. Landlord hereby grants Tenant the option, which option shall be
exercisable by Tenant upon the delivery of at not less than three (3) nor
more than twelve (12) months prior written notice to Landlord, to extend the
term of the Lease for one (1) additional period of sixty (60) months. Annual
rent payable during the entire extension term, if exercised, shall be at
Market Rental Value as determined prior to the commencement of such extension
term in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

6\. All sums due and payable by Tenant to Landlord under the Lease have been
paid in full through and including the date of this Certificate. Landlord
confirms that the current annual rent payable under the Lease is $464,856.00.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, the annual
rent payable for the remainder of the initial term of the Lease (i.e., through
December 31, 2020, unless sooner terminated) is hereby reduced to, and shall
remain at, $153,934.00.

7\. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Lease, and by execution hereof, Landlord
hereby consents to any assignment of the Lease effectuated by the
transactions contemplated by that  certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Tenant, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Inc., DKC Acquisition Corp. and Emiko Terasaki dated on or about
the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement").

8\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that Tenant shall have no obligation to remove any Alterations,
Lessee Owned Alterations or Utility Installations which are in the Premises as
of the date of this Certificate, except to the extent listed on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto.

 

9\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that Tenants environmental and surrender obligations under
Lease shall in no event be deemed to include any obligation in excess of the
standards imposed by applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

10\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that Tenants obligations under Section 7.3(c) of the Lease to
surrender the Premises on the Expiration Date or any earlier termination date
of the Lease, shall in no event be deemed to require Tenant to surrender the
Premises in a better condition than the Premises are in as of the date of this
Certificate, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

11\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease,
including without limitation Sections 2.3 and 7.1 thereof, in the event that
any Capital Expenditure is required to made by either party pursuant to the
terms of the Lease and the useful life of such Capital Expenditure extends
beyond the then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Lease, then in such event
Landlord shall be obligated to pay the entire cost of such Capital Expenditure
and Tenant shall only be obligated to pay, together with monthly rental
payments during the remaining term of the Lease, the Charge-Off Amount as
defined herein. As used herein, the term "Charge-Off Amount" shall mean an
amount equal to the product of (a) the cost of such Capital Expenditure,
multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and
the denominator of which is the number of months in the useful life of the
Capital Expenditure so made, calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

12\. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, then the
terms of this Certificate, including any amendments to the Lease contained
herein, shall simultaneously terminate without the need for further action by
either party, in which event this Certificate shall be deemed null and void
and of no force or effect, and neither party shall have any obligation to the
other in connection herewith.

 

13\. Landlord acknowledges that this Certificate is intended to be relied upon
by Tenant and by the parties to the Merger Agreement.

above.

Upon reasonable advance notice to Seller and subject to the rights of tenants
under Leases, Buyer and its agents, employees and representatives,
contractors, architects and other parties designated by Buyer (" _Buyer s

access to the Property and all books and records for the Property that are in

environmental inspections and tests (including reasonable intrusive inspection
and sampling), and any other inspections, studies, or tests reasonably
required by Buyer. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a "walk-through" of
the Property before Closing, subject to the rights of tenants under Leases.
Seller shall have the right to accompany Buyer during its inspection
and investigation of the Property. In the course of its investigations, Buyer
may make inquiries to third parties, including, without limitation, tenants,
lenders, contractors, property managers, parties to Service Contracts and

Buyer shall keep the Property free and clear of any liens arising out of

harmless from all such liens and any claims asserted by third parties against
Seller (other than those arising out of Sellers negligence or willful
misconduct) to recover for personal injury or property damage as a result of
Buyers Representatives entry onto the Property. If any inspection or test
damages the Property, Buyer will restore the Property to its condition
immediately prior to any such inspection or test. Buyers obligations under
this _Section 2.1_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

2.2 _Seller s Delivery of Specified Documents_. In order to assist Buyer with
its inspection and review of the Property, Seller has previously delivered or
made available to Buyer copies of the items set forth on Appendix 2.2 to this
Agreement with respect to each Property, in each case to the extent applicable
to the Property and in Sellers or its property managers possession or
control, but specifically excluding all such items obtained by, and in the
possession or control of, Tenant not in the actual possession of Seller
(collectively, the "Property Information"). During the term of this
Agreement, to the extent not previously provided or made

 



-4-   available to Buyer, Seller shall provide Buyer with any document described
above as and when it comes into Sellers or its property managers possession
or is produced by Seller or its property manager after the initial delivery
of the Property Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall make
all other documents, files and information concerning the Property in Sellers
possession available for Buyers inspection at the Property or such other
location as shall be mutually agreed by the parties.

2.3 _Title and Survey_. Buyer shall have the right, at its option and at its
cost and expense, to cause to be prepared with respect to the Property (i) the
Title Commitment, (ii) true, complete and legible copies of all documents
referenced in the Title Commitment, (iii) the Survey and (iv) UCC searches
performed by a search company reasonably acceptable to Buyer, with respect to
Seller and the Property, from the Secretary of State of the state in which the
Property is located and from the Secretary of State of the state in which
Seller is organized, and from the County Recorder for the county in which the
Property is located.

2.4 _Required Title Clearance Matters_. Seller shall be obligated at Closing
to fully discharge all liens of a definite and ascertainable amount that are
not specifically assumed or accepted by Buyer in writing, including without
limitation any debt secured by a deed of trust encumbering the Property, as
well as those exceptions or encumbrances to title which arise after the date
of the Title Commitment, other than any such liens, exceptions or
encumbrances created by, through or under the Tenant (collectively, the
"Required Title Clearance Matters"). If Seller fails or refuses to cause the
Required Title Clearance Matters to be discharged prior to Closing, Buyer
shall have the right to deduct from the Purchase Price any amounts required to
discharge or remove to Buyers satisfaction all Required Title Clearance
Matters. If after the date of the Title Commitment, the Title Company revises
the Title Commitment or the surveyor revises the Survey to add or modify
exceptions which arise after the date of the Title Commitment, other than any
such exceptions created by, through or under the Tenant, each such matter
shall be deemed to be a Required Title Clearance Matter. In addition to
Required Title Clearance Matters, Seller shall be obligated to use
commercially reasonable efforts to discharge or remove from title, or, in the
event such matters were created by, through or under Tenant, to cause Tenant
to discharge or remove from title, prior to Closing all matters which would in
Buyers reasonable discretion, either (a) unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the Buyers intended business operations at the Property or (b)
have a material adverse impact on the value of the Property, but specifically
excluding the Leases (collectively, the "Material Title Objections"). Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any Material Title Objections as soon as is
reasonably practicable following Buyers receipt of the Title Commitment. In
the event Seller fails to cause the Material Title Objections to be discharged
prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at
any time prior to Closing upon the delivery of written notice to Seller (a
"Material Title Termination Notice"), in which event (i) this Agreement shall
be null and void and neither party shall have any further obligation to the
other, except as expressly set forth herein, and (ii) at the closing of the
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Seller shall be obligated to
execute and deliver, and cause the Tenant to execute and deliver, one (1)
fully-executed original Landlord Estoppel and Lease Amendment in the form
attached hereto as Appendix 2.4. The terms of this Section 2.4 shall expressly
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



-5-  2.5 _Service Contracts_. Unless otherwise elected by Buyer, Buyer
shall assume the Service Contracts (the "Accepted Service Contracts") at
Closing. Buyer will assume the obligations arising from and after the Closing
Date under the Accepted Service Contracts that are not in default as of the
Closing Date. Seller shall terminate at Closing any Service Contracts that
are not so assumed by Buyer.

2.6 _CCRs_. If the Property is subject to a declaration of covenants,
conditions and restrictions or similar instrument ("CCRs") governing or
affecting the use, operation, maintenance, management or improvement of such
Property, then as a condition to Buyers obligation to close, at Closing,
Seller: (i) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver
into the escrow estoppel certificates, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, from the declarant, association, committee, agent
and/or other person or entity having governing or approval rights under the
CCRs, and (ii) shall execute and deliver into the escrow a recordable
assignment, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, assigning to Buyer
any and all developer, declarant or other related rights or interests of
Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) in or under the CCRs.

2.7 _Approval_. Buyers obligations hereunder are expressly subject to Buyers
approval of the Property in all respects, including, without limitation,
title, economic feasibility, financing, zoning, the local government
comprehensive plan, redevelopment potential, structural components of any
improvements, governmental restrictions and requirements, availability of
utilities, physical condition, subsoil conditions, environmental matters and
such other matters as may be of concern to Buyer. Buyer shall have until the
Closing Date in which to determine whether the Property is acceptable to
Buyer, in its sole discretion, in all respects. If Buyer finds the Property
to be unacceptable and elects not to proceed with the transaction contemplated
hereby, Buyer shall have right to terminate this Agreement for any or no
reason as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion by written notice to
such effect given to Seller and Escrow Holder at any time prior to the
Closing Date.

_ARTICLE 3: AS-IS CONDITION OF PROPERTY _

3.1 _Condition of Property_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i) that Buyer shall accept
the Property in "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition with all faults and defects,
whether patent or latent, and shall rely solely on its own inspections and due
diligence to evaluate all aspects of the Property and its suitability without
any representations and warranties of any kind or nature concerning the

4.1 _Ongoing Operations_. From the Effective Date through the Closing Date.

 

(a) _Operation of Property_. Seller shall maintain the Property in
substantially its current condition and in compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations to the extent the same are the responsibility of the landlord
under the Leases, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Tenant to maintain the Property in substantially its current condition and in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to the extent the same
are the responsibility of the Tenant under the Leases. Except as necessary to
comply with the preceding sentence, Seller shall not make any material
alterations to the Property or any portion thereof or consent to the Tenant
making any material alterations to the Property or any portion thereof without
Buyers prior written consent. Seller will perform its obligations under all
Leases, Service Contracts and other agreements that may affect the Property.

(b) _New Contracts_. Seller shall not, without Buyers prior written consent
in each instance, amend, terminate, exercise any rights or options under,
grant concessions regarding, or enter into any contract or agreement that will
be an obligation affecting the Property or binding on Buyer after Closing.

broker or otherwise solicit or make or accept any offers to sell all or any

disposition of all or any part of the Property, except as set forth in
Section 4.1(b) and (g).

(d) _Removal and Replacement of Tangible Personal Property_. Seller will not
remove any Personal Property except as may be required for necessary repair or
replacement, and repair and replacement shall be of equal quality and quantity
as existed as of the time of its removal.

 

(e) _Maintenance of Insurance_. Seller shall carry its existing insurance, if
any, through the Closing Date, and shall not allow any breach, default,
termination or cancellation of such insurance policies or agreements to occur
or exist, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Tenant to

Date . 

(f) _Maintenance of Permits_. Seller shall maintain in existence all existing

contractors, shall take or fail to take any action that causes Sellers
representations or warranties to become untrue or that causes one or more of
Buyers conditions to Closing based on Sellers performance of its
obligations under this Agreement to be unsatisfied.

4.2 _Damage_. Risk of loss up to and including the Closing shall be borne by
Seller. Seller shall promptly give Buyer written notice of any damage to the
Property, describing such damage, stating whether such damage and loss of
rents is covered by insurance and the estimated cost of repairing such
damage. In the event of any damage to or destruction of the Property or any
portion thereof, Seller shall, at the Closing, assign to Buyer (without
recourse) Sellers entire right, title and interest, if any, in and to any
insurance proceeds (including any rent loss insurance applicable to any period
on and after the Closing Date) due Seller as a result of such damage or
destruction and Buyer shall assume responsibility for such repair, and Buyer
shall receive a credit at Closing for any deductible, uninsured or coinsured
amount under said insurance policies. To the extent Seller has incurred
reasonable market based costs in effecting the repairs requested and directed
by Buyer (which costs have not been assumed by Buyer), Seller shall be paid a
portion of such insurance proceeds in an amount equal to such costs. In the
event of any damage to or destruction of the Property or portion thereof which
is not covered by existing insurance, Seller hereby agrees that it shall not
exercise any termination right it may have as Landlord under the Leases,
including without limitation Section 9 thereof, and the cost of repairing such
uninsured damage or destruction shall be the amount estimated by an architect
or contractor retained pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties.

4.3  _Condemnation_. In the event any proceedings in eminent domain are
contemplated, threatened or instituted by any body having the power of eminent
domain with respect to the Property or any portion thereof, Seller shall, at

with the condemning authority in respect of such matter.

_ARTICLE 6: PRORATIONS; COSTS_

6.1 _Prorations_. Not less than five (5) business days prior to Closing,
Seller shall provide to Buyer such information and verification reasonably
necessary to support the prorations under this _Article 5_. The items in this
_Section 6.1_ shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Closing Date
being a day of income and expense to Buyer. Credits to Buyer shall be credited
against the Purchase Price to be paid as provided in _Section 1.3_ and, if
such amount is exhausted, shall be paid in cash by Seller to Buyer at the
Closing. Post-closing re-prorations and adjustments shall be paid in cash.

(a)  _Taxes and Assessments_. Buyer shall receive a credit for any accrued
but unpaid real estate taxes and assessments (" _Taxes_ ") (including without
limitation any assessments imposed by private covenant) applicable to any
period before the Closing Date, even if such taxes and assessments are not
yet due and payable, but only to the extent any such amounts are not otherwise
required to be paid by the tenants under any Leases. Buyer shall receive from
Seller a credit for any special assessments which are levied or charged
against the Property with respect to any infrastructure improvements
specifically made to serve the Property, whether or not then due and payable
(but excluding any special assessments payable in installments to the extent
any such installment is not yet due and payable), but only to the extent any
such amounts are not otherwise required to be paid by the tenants under any
Leases. Any other special assessments not otherwise required to be paid by
the tenants under any Leases shall be prorated only for the year of Closing.
The credit received under this _Section 6.1(a)_ shall not be duplicative of
any credit received under _Section 6.1(c)_ which is specifically allocable
to such items.

(b) _Collected Rent_. Buyer shall receive from Seller a credit for any rent
and other income (and any applicable state or local tax on rent) under Leases
collected by Seller before Closing that applies to any period after Closing.
Uncollected rent and other uncollected income shall not be prorated at
Closing. After Closing, Buyer shall apply all rent and income collected by
Buyer from a tenant, first to the costs of such collection, then to such
tenants current monthly rental and then to arrearages in the reverse order in
which they were due, remitting to Seller, any balance properly allocable to
Sellers period of ownership. Buyer shall bill and use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect such rent arrearages in the ordinary course of business,
but shall not be obligated to engage a collection agency or take legal action
to collect any rent arrearages. Seller shall not have the right to seek
collection of any rents or other income applicable to any period before the
Closing. Any rent or other income received by Seller after 

 



-15-   Closing which are owed to Buyer shall be held in trust and remitted to Buyer
promptly after receipt for allocation and disbursement as provided in this
_Section 6.1(b)_.

 

(c) _Tenant Deposits_. All tenant security deposits (and interest thereon if
required by law or contract to be earned thereon) shall be transferred or
credited to Buyer at Closing. As of Closing, Buyer shall assume Sellers
obligations related to tenant security deposits, but only to the extent they
are properly credited and transferred to Buyer. In the event any discrepancy
in the amount of a security deposit between _Appendix 6.1(c)_ or the
applicable Lease, proration shall be based upon the higher amount.

(d) _Other Revenues and Income_. At Closing, Seller shall pay to or at the
direction of Buyer any and all revenues and income in connection with the
operation at the Property not covered above and collected by or on behalf of
Seller before the Closing and applicable to Buyers period of ownership, and
if such amount cannot be determined at Closing, such payment shall be based
upon an estimate. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to make a final
determination of such amount and make an appropriate adjusting payment within
thirty (30) days after Closing. In addition, each party shall promptly remit
or cause to be remitted to the other any such revenues and income collected by
such party after Closing and applicable to the other partys period of
ownership.

6.2 _Post-Closing Corrections_. Either party shall be entitled to a post-
Closing adjustment for any incorrect proration or adjustment, provided such
adjustment is claimed by such party within one year after Closing. No other
expense related to the ownership or operation of the Property shall be charged
to or paid or assumed by Buyer under this Agreement, other than those
obligations expressly assumed by Buyer.

6.3  _Utilities_. Except for utilities which are in the name of and billed
directly to tenants, Seller shall cause the meters, if any, for utilities to
be read the day on which the Closing Date occurs and to pay the bills rendered
on the basis of such readings. If any such meter reading for any utility is
not available, then adjustment therefor shall be made on the basis of the most
recently issued bills therefor which are based on meter readings no earlier
than thirty (30) days before the Closing Date; and such adjustment shall be
reprorated when the next utility bills are received. The credit received under
this _Section 6.3_ shall not be duplicative of any credit received under 
_Section 6.1(c)_ which is specifically allocable to such items.

6.4 _Service Contracts_. Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall receive a
credit for regular charges under Accepted Service Contracts paid and
applicable to Buyers period of ownership or payable and applicable to
Sellers period of ownership, respectively. Seller shall pay at Closing all
amounts owing under those Service Contracts that are not Accepted Service
Contracts.

6.5  _Costs_. Buyer shall pay (i) one-half of the Escrow Agents escrow fee,
closing charges and any cancellation fee, (ii) one-half of the cost of the
Title Commitment, the Survey and the Endorsements (including
extended coverage), and (iii) the costs associated with Buyers due diligence
activities. Seller shall pay (i) one-half of the Escrow Agents escrow fee,
closing charges and any cancellation fee, (ii) the cost of the Title
Policy (standard coverage), one-half of the cost of the Title Commitment and
the Endorsements (including extended coverage), and if

 



-16-   Closing occurs, one-half of the cost of the Survey, and (iii) all recording
fees or other charges incurred in connection with clearing title, including
without limitation any prepayment or release fees. Each party shall be
responsible for their own attorneys and other professional fees.

6.6  _Sales, Transfer, and Documentary Taxes_. All sales, gross receipts,
compensating, stamp, excise, documentary, transfer, deed or similar taxes and
fees imposed in connection with this transaction under applicable state or
county law shall be paid by Seller and such tax imposed by local ordinance
shall be paid by the party designated in such ordinances as being responsible
for such payment. Seller and Buyer shall execute any applicable city, county
and state transfer tax or other declarations.

6.7 _Utility Deposits_. Seller shall receive a credit for the amount of
deposits, if any, with utility companies that are transferable and that are
assigned to Buyer at the Closing.

6.8 _Sales Commissions_. Seller and Buyer represent and warrant each to the
other that they have not dealt with any real estate broker, sales person or
finder in connection with this transaction. Except as expressly set forth
above, in the event of any claim for brokers or finders fees or commissions
in connection with the negotiation, execution or consummation of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the other party from and against any such claim
based upon any actual or alleged statement, representation or agreement of the
indemnifying party. This provision shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 

6.9 _Wages_. Buyer shall not be liable for any wages, fringe benefits, payroll
taxes, unemployment insurance contributions, accrued vacation pay, accrued
pay for unused sick leave, accrued severance pay and other compensation
accruing before Closing for the Employees. Buyer shall not be liable for any
obligations accruing before Closing under any union contract or multi-
employer pension plan applicable to any such Employees or arising from the
termination of any such Employees at or prior to Closing.

existing, and is in good standing and is qualified to do business in
the State of California. Seller has the full right, power and authority and
has obtained any and all consents required to enter into this Agreement, all
of the documents to be delivered by Seller at the Closing and to consummate or
cause to be consummated the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been, and all of the documents to be delivered by Seller at the Closing
will be, authorized and properly executed and constitutes, or will constitute,
as appropriate, the valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable in
accordance with their terms.

(b) _Conflicts and Pending Actions or Proceedings_. There is no agreement to
which Seller is a party or, to Sellers knowledge, binding on Seller which is
in conflict with this Agreement. There is no action or proceeding pending or,
to Sellers knowledge, threatened against Seller or, 

 



-17-   except as set forth in the Tenants Disclosures, relating to the Property.
To Sellers knowledge, no condemnation, eminent domain or similar proceedings
are pending or threatened with regard to the Property. Seller has not
received any notice and has no knowledge of any pending or threatened liens,
special assessments, impositions or increases in assessed valuations to be
made against the Property.

 

(c) _Leases_. The documents constituting the Leases that are delivered to
Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.2_ are true, correct and complete copies of all
of the Leases affecting the Property, including any and all amendments and
guarantees, and all Leases are listed on _Appendix 7.1(c)._ To Sellers
knowledge, no tenant under any Lease has assigned its interest under
such Lease or subleased all or any portion of its premises, except as set
forth on _Appendix 7.1(c)_ or in the Tenants Disclosures. Except for tenants
under Leases and others, if any, claiming by, though or under tenants under
the Leases, there are no parties holding any right to occupy the Property or
any portion thereof. There are no leasing or other fees or commissions due,
nor will any become due, in connection with any Lease or any renewal or
extension or expansion of any Lease, and no understanding or agreement to
which Seller is a party with any other party exists as to payment of any
leasing commissions or fees regarding future leases or as to the procuring of
tenants. The Leases are in full force and effect and neither Seller nor, to
Sellers best knowledge, any of the tenants are in default. To Sellers
knowledge, no tenants have asserted nor are there any defenses or offsets to
rent accruing after the Closing Date. All of the landlords obligations to
construct tenant improvements or reimburse the tenants for tenant improvements
under the Leases have been paid and performed in full and all concessions
(other than any unexpired rent abatement set forth in the Leases) from
the landlord under the Leases have been paid and performed in full. The
Leases set forth all of the applicable tenants rights and obligations with
respect to the Property. Seller has not assigned or pledged the Leases or
Rents or any interest therein.

(d) _Service Contracts_. The list of Service Contracts attached hereto as
_Appendix 7.1(d)_ is a true, correct and complete list of all contracts
affecting the Property. The documents constituting the Service Contracts that
are delivered to Buyer as a part of the initial Property Information are true,
correct and complete copies of all the Service Contracts affecting
the Property. Neither Seller nor, to Sellers knowledge, any other party is
in default under any Service Contract. There are no contracts affecting the
Property other than the Service Contracts, this Agreement and those entered
into by Tenant. 

(e) _Permits, Legal Compliance, and Notice of Defects_. To Sellers knowledge,
Seller has all licenses, permits and certificates necessary for the use and
operation of the Property, including, without limitation, all certificates of
occupancy necessary for the occupancy of the Property (but specifically
excluding all licenses, permits and certificates to be obtained by the Tenant
necessary for the use and operation of the Property by the Tenant), all of
which are in full force and effect, and Seller has not taken or failed to take
any action that would result in its revocation, and has not received any
written notice of an intention to revoke any of them. Seller has received no
written notice from any governmental authority or other person of any
violation of zoning, building, fire, health, environmental, or other statutes,
ordinances, regulations or orders (including those respecting the Americans
with Disabilities Act), or any restriction, condition, covenant or consent in
regard to the Property or any part thereof which have not been corrected to
the satisfaction of the issuer.

 



-18-  (f) _Environmental_. Seller has no knowledge of any violation of Environmental
Laws related to the Property or the presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from the Property except as disclosed in the initially
delivered Property Information and in the Tenants Disclosures. Except for
Hazardous Materials used in connection with the maintenance and operation of
the Property and the business and operations of the Tenant conducted on the
Property in accordance with Environmental Laws, and except as disclosed in the
Property Information and in the Tenants Disclosures, to Sellers knowledge,
(1) neither Seller nor any tenant or other occupant has manufactured,
introduced, released or discharged from or onto the Property any Hazardous
Materials or any toxic wastes, substances or materials (including,
without limitation, asbestos), nor used the Property or any part thereof for
the generation, treatment, storage, handling or disposal of any Hazardous
Materials except in accordance with Environmental Laws, and (ii) there are no
underground storage tanks located on the Property. To Sellers knowledge, no
environmental assessments or studies exist with respect to the Property other
than those, if any referred to in the Tenants Disclosures.

 

(g) _Disclosure_. Other than this Agreement, the documents delivered at
Closing pursuant hereto, the Permitted Exceptions, the Accepted
Service Contracts and, to the extent applicable, the Intangible Property
Contracts, there are no contracts or agreements of any kind relating to the
Property to which Seller or its agents is a party and which would be binding
on Buyer after closing. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer true,
correct and complete copies of the Property Information to the extent any such
item is in Sellers or its property managers possession or control.

 

(h) _ERISA_. Seller is not and are not acting on behalf of (i) an "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (ii) a "plan" within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or (iii) an
entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
§2510.3-101 of any such employee benefit plan or plans.

(i) _Employees_. There are no collective bargaining agreements or other
similar agreements currently affecting the Property or which could be deemed
to affect the Property after the Closing, nor are there any persons employed
by Seller or its property manager, if applicable, in connection with the
Property.

The phrase "Sellers knowledge" or any similar phrase means the actual
knowledge of Paul I. Terasaki but without any duty to investigate on his
part.

7.2 _Buyer s Representations and Warranties_. As a material inducement to
Seller to execute this Agreement and consummate this transaction, Buyer
represents and warrants to Seller that:

(a)  _Organization and Authority_. Buyer has been duly organized and is
validly existing as a California corporation. Subject only to obtaining
certain internal approvals on or before the Closing Date, Buyer has the full
right and authority and has obtained any and all consents required to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate or cause to be consummated the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been, and all of the
documents to be delivered by Buyer at the Closing will be, authorized and
properly executed and constitutes, or

 



-19-   will constitute, as appropriate, the valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable in accordance with their terms.

(b) _Conflicts and Pending Action_. There is no agreement to which Buyer is a
party or to Buyers knowledge binding on Buyer which is in conflict with this
Agreement. There is no action or proceeding pending or, to Buyers knowledge,
threatened against Buyer which challenges or impairs Buyers ability to
execute or perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

7.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties set forth in this _Article 6 _ are made as of the date of this
Agreement and each of Seller and Buyer shall be deemed to have remade all of
their respective representations and warranties as of the Closing Date. Such
representations and warranties and shall not be deemed to be merged into or
waived by the instruments of Closing, but shall survive the Closing until the
expiration of the Survival Period, as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall have the right to bring an action for
breach of such representations and warranties if they give the other party
written notice of the circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach within
said Survival Period, and have brought an action thereon within six (6) months
of the expiration of said Survival Period.

_ARTICLE 8: DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_

 

8.1 _Seller s Default_. If this transaction fails to close as a result of
Sellers default (all conditions to Sellers obligations having been
satisfied or waived), Buyer shall be entitled to such remedies for breach of
contract as may be available at law and in equity, including without
limitation, the remedy of specific performance. If, after Sellers default,
Buyer elects not to proceed with the Closing, then Seller will, on demand,
reimburse Buyer for all expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with this
Agreement, including all due diligence expenses. Any default by Tenant
under the Merger Agreement shall be deemed to be a default of Seller
hereunder.

8.2 _Buyer s Default_. If this transaction fails to close due to the default
of Buyer (all conditions to Buyers obligations having been satisfied or
waived), then Sellers sole remedy in such event shall be to terminate this
Agreement, Seller waiving all other rights or remedies in the event of such
default by Buyer. Any default by DKC Acquisition Corp. under the Merger
Agreement shall be deemed to be a default of Buyer hereunder.

8.3 _Other Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated due to the default of a
party, then the defaulting party shall pay any fees due to the Escrow Agent
and any fees due to the Title Company for cancellation of the Title
Commitment.

8.4 _Termination of Merger Agreement_. In the event the Merger Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then this Agreement shall simultaneously terminate
without the need for further action by either party, in which event this
Agreement shall be null and void and neither party shall have any further
obligation to the other.

_ARTICLE 9: INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.1 _Seller s Indemnity_. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
harmless from any liability, claim, demand, loss, expense or damage
(collectively, " _loss_ ") that is: (a)

 



-20-   asserted by any person or entity against Buyer arising from any act or
omission of Seller, its agents, employees or contractors or otherwise arising
out of the ownership or operation of the Property first arising or occurring
prior to the Closing (but specifically excluding any such loss arising out of
the use or operation of the Property by the Tenant first arising or occurring
prior to the Closing); or (b) arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any
of Sellers representations and warranties set forth herein or (c) arising
from any breach by Seller of any obligation related to the Property other than
those obligations which by this Agreement, or any closing delivery,
specifically becomes the obligation of Buyer.

9.2 _Buyer s Indemnity_. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless of and from any loss that is: (a) asserted by any person or entity
against, Seller arising from any act or omission of Buyer or the Tenant, their
respective agents, employees or contractors or otherwise arising out of the
ownership or operation of the Property first arising or occurring on or after
the Closing; or (b) arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any of Buyers
representations or warranties set forth herein or (c) arising from any breach
by Buyer of any obligation of Buyer related to the Property which by this
Agreement, or any closing delivery, specifically becomes the obligation of
Buyer.

 

9.3 _Procedure_. The following provisions govern all actions for indemnity
under this Article 8 and any other provision of this Agreement. Promptly
after receipt by an indemnitee of notice of any claim, such indemnitee will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnitor, deliver to
the indemnitor written notice thereof and the indemnitor shall have the right
to participate in and, if the indemnitor agrees in writing that it will be
responsible for any costs, expenses, judgments, damages, and losses incurred
by the indemnitee with respect to such claim, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and
expenses to be paid by the indemnitee, if the indemnitee reasonably
believes that representation of such indemnitee by the counsel retained by
the indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between such indemnitee and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding. The failure of indemnitee to deliver written
notice to the indemnitor within a reasonable time after indemnitee receives
notice of any such claim shall relieve such indemnitor of any liability to the
indemnitee under this indemnity only if and to the extent that such failure
is prejudicial to the indemnitors ability to defend such action, and the
omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnitor will not relieve it of
any liability that it may have to any indemnitee other than under this
indemnity. If an indemnitee settles a claim without the prior written consent
of the indemnitor, then the indemnitor shall be released from liability with
respect to such claim unless the indemnitor has unreasonably withheld such
consent. 

9.4 _Survivability_. The obligations of the parties under this _Article 9_
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the Survival Period. Seller
and Buyer shall have the right to bring an action for indemnification
hereunder if they give the other party written notice of the circumstances
giving rise to the indemnified claim within said Survival Period, and have
brought an action thereon within six (6) months of the expiration of said
Survival Period.

 

 _ARTICLE 10: MISCELLANEOUS_

 



-21-  10.1 _Parties Bound_. Neither party may assign this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other, and any such prohibited assignment
shall be void; provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement without
Sellers consent to an Affiliate. Buyer shall not be relieved of its
obligations under this Agreement in the event of such assignment. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the respective legal representatives, successors, assigns, heirs, and
devises of the parties.

 

10.2 _Headings_. The article and paragraph headings of this Agreement are for
convenience only and in no way limit or enlarge the scope or meaning of the
language hereof.

10.3 _Invalidity and Waiver_. If any portion of this Agreement is held
invalid or inoperative, then so far as is reasonable and possible the
remainder of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and operative, and, to the
greatest extent legally possible, effect shall be given to the intent
manifested by the portion held invalid or inoperative. The failure by either
party to enforce against the other any term or provision of this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such partys right to enforce against
the other party the same or any other such term or provision in the future.

10.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall, in all respects, be governed,
construed, applied, and enforced in accordance with the law of the state in
which the Real Property is located.

10.5 _Survival_. The provisions of this Agreement that contemplate performance
after the Closing, the obligations of the parties not fully performed at the
Closing, and all indemnities set forth in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and shall not be deemed to be merged into or waived by the instruments
of Closing.

10.6 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement is not intended to give or
confer any benefits, rights, privileges, claims, actions, or remedies to any
person or entity as a third party beneficiary, decree, or otherwise.

10.7 _Entirety and Amendments_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
relating to the Property. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only
by an instrument in writing executed by the party against whom enforcement
is sought.

10.9 _Confidentiality_. Seller shall make no public announcement or other
disclosure of this Agreement or any information related to this Agreement to
outside brokers or third parties, before or after the Closing, without the
prior written specific consent of Buyer; provided, however, that Seller may
make disclosure of this Agreement to its lenders, creditors, officers,
employees and agents as necessary to perform its obligations hereunder.

10.10 _Enforcement Expenses_. Should either party employ attorneys to enforce
any of the provisions hereof, the party against whom any final judgment is
entered agrees to pay the prevailing party all reasonable costs, charges, and
expenses, including attorneys fees and costs, expended or incurred in
connection therewith.

 



-22-  10.11 _Notices_. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be served on the parties at the addresses set forth in
_Appendix 9.11_. Any such notices shall be either (a) sent by overnight
delivery using a nationally recognized overnight courier, in which case notice

(b) sent by certified or regular U.S. mail, postage prepaid, in which case
notice shall be deemed delivered two business days after deposit in such

delivery, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered upon receipt or
refusal of delivery. A partys address may be changed by written notice to
the other party; provided, however, that no notice of a change of address
shall be effective until actual receipt of such notice. Copies of notices are
for informational purposes only, and a failure to give or receive copies of
any notice shall not be deemed a failure to give notice. Notices given by
counsel to Buyer shall be deemed given by Buyer and notices given by counsel
to Seller shall be deemed given by Seller.

 

10.12 _Construction_. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their
counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and the documents to be
executed at the Closing and agree that the normal rule of construction to the
effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement, the documents
to be delivered at Closing or any exhibits or amendments thereto.

10.13 _Calculation of Time Periods_. Unless otherwise specified, in computing
any period of time described herein, the day of the act or event after which
the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included and the last
day of the period so computed is to be included at, unless such last day is a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for national banks in the location where the
Property is located, in which event the period shall run until the end of the
next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The last day
of any period of time described herein shall be deemed to end at 5 p.m. C.S.T.

10.14  _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and
all of such counterparts shall constitute one Agreement. To facilitate
execution of this Agreement, the parties may execute and exchange by
telephone facsimile counterparts of the signature pages.

10.15  _Further Assurances_. In addition to the acts and deeds recited herein
and contemplated to be performed, executed and/or delivered by either party at
Closing, each party agrees to perform, execute and deliver, but without any
obligation to incur any additional liability or expense, on or after the
Closing any further deliveries and assurances as may be reasonably necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to further perfect the
conveyance, transfer and assignment of the Property to Buyer.

10.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

10.17 _Bulk Sales_. If any applicable provisions of law require that any state
or local taxation authorities be notified of the transactions contemplated
herein, or if clearance is required

 



-23-   of such authorities, each in order to permit the transfer of the Property as
contemplated herein without liability to Buyer for any state or local taxes
required to be paid or collected by Seller prior to the Closing Date, it
shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of Buyer hereunder that all
such notification and clearance requirements shall have been complied with and
the Buyer shall have received the requisite clearances and releases from
further liability. Seller shall, within ten (10) days after the Effective Date
make all filings necessary to obtain such clearances, and shall
contemporaneously provide Buyer with copies of all such filings.

 

10.18 _Mutual Execution_. Until this Agreement has been dully executed by both
Buyer and Seller and a fully executed copy has been delivered to each of
Buyer and Seller (which may occur by facsimile transmission), this Agreement
shall not be legally binding against the parties. Execution of this Agreement
by Buyer shall constitute an offer to acquire the Property on the terms and
conditions set forth herein but, if not executed by Seller within five (5)
days after delivery by Buyer, it may be withdrawn by Buyer in its discretion
at any time thereafter.

 

10.19 _1031 Exchange_. Buyer may consummate the purchase of the Property as
part of a so-called like kind exchange (the " _Exchange_ ") pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Code, provided that: (1) the Closing shall not be delayed
or affected by reason of the Exchange nor shall the consummation or
accomplishment of the Exchange be a condition precedent or condition
subsequent to Buyers obligations under this Agreement; (2) Buyer shall effect
the Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this
Agreement, to a qualified intermediary; (3) Seller shall not be required to
take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished property or

consummating the Exchange; (4) Buyer shall pay any additional costs that
would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had Buyer not
consummated its purchase through the Exchange; and (5) Buyer shall indemnify,
defend, and hold Seller harmless from or against all claims, losses, costs,
damages, liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection
therewith. Sellers acquiescence to the Exchange shall not affect or diminish
in any manner its rights hereunder nor shall Seller be responsible for
compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to Buyer that the Exchange in
fact complies with § 1031 of the Code.

and agreeing with ONE LAMBDA, INC., a California corporation ("Tenant") as

February 19, 1998, as amended by Amendment dated as of March 31, 2008 and that
certain renewal notice from Tenant to Landlord dated as of February 1, 2011
(as so amended, and as amended herein, the "Lease"), affecting certain real
property (the "Property") located at 21001 Kittridge Street, Canoga Park,
California, as more particularly described in the Lease. Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Lease.

2\. The Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified, amended
or supplemented in any way, except as set forth above. Landlord is holding a
security deposit under the Lease in the amount of $47,700.00.

3\. Tenant is not in default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of the Lease and no event has occurred and no situation exists which would,
with the passage of time, or the giving of notice or both, constitute a
default by the Tenant under the Lease.

4\. The term of the Lease is currently set to expire on March 31, 2014.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees (a) the term of the Lease shall be and hereby is extended to
December 31, 2020, and (b) Tenant shall have the right to terminate the Lease
prior to the then-scheduled expiration date, which right shall be exercisable
by Tenant upon the delivery of at least twelve (12) months prior written
notice to Landlord any time after September 1, 2014. 

5\. Landlord hereby grants Tenant the option, which option shall be
exercisable by Tenant upon the delivery of at not less than three (3) nor
more than twelve (12) months prior written notice to Landlord, to extend the
term of the Lease for one (1) additional period of sixty (60) months. Annual
rent payable during the entire extension term, if exercised, shall be at
Market Rental Value as determined prior to the commencement of such extension
term in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

6\. All sums due and payable by Tenant to Landlord under the Lease have been
paid in full through and including the date of this Certificate. Landlord
confirms that the current annual rent payable under the Lease is $912,276.00.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, the annual
rent payable for the remainder of the initial term of the Lease (i.e., through

remain at, $508,800.00.

contractors, architects and other parties designated by Buyer (" _Buyer s

required by Buyer. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a "walk-through" of

Seller shall have the right to accompany Buyer during its inspection
and investigation of the Property. In the course of its investigations, Buyer

lenders, contractors, property managers, parties to Service Contracts and
municipal, local and other government officials and representatives.

Buyer shall keep the Property free and clear of any liens arising out of

harmless from all such liens and any claims asserted by third parties against
Seller (other than those arising out of Sellers negligence or willful
misconduct) to recover for personal injury or property damage as a result of

damages the Property, Buyer will restore the Property to its condition
immediately prior to any such inspection or test. Buyers obligations under
this _Section 2.1_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

2.2  _Seller s Delivery of Specified Documents_. In order to assist Buyer
with its inspection and review of the Property, Seller has previously
delivered or made available to Buyer copies of the items set forth on Appendix
2.2 to this Agreement with respect to each Property, in each case to the
extent applicable to the Property and in Sellers or its property managers
possession or control, but specifically excluding all such items obtained by,
and in the possession or control of, Tenant not in the actual possession of
Seller (collectively, the "Property Information"). During the term of this
Agreement, to the extent not previously provided or made 

 



-4-   available to Buyer, Seller shall provide Buyer with any document described
above as and when it comes into Sellers or its property managers possession
or is produced by Seller or its property manager after the initial delivery
of the Property Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall make
all other documents, files and information concerning the Property in Sellers
possession available for Buyers inspection at the Property or such other
location as shall be mutually agreed by the parties.

2.3 _Title and Survey_. Buyer shall have the right, at its option and at its

Title Commitment, (ii) true, complete and legible copies of all documents
referenced in the Title Commitment, (iii) the Survey and (iv) UCC searches
performed by a search company reasonably acceptable to Buyer, with respect to

Property is located and from the Secretary of State of the state in which
Seller is organized, and from the County Recorder for the county in which the
Property is located.

2.4 _Required Title Clearance Matters_. Seller shall be obligated at Closing
to fully discharge all liens of a definite and ascertainable amount that are
not specifically assumed or accepted by Buyer in writing, including without
limitation any debt secured by a deed of trust encumbering the Property, as
well as those exceptions or encumbrances to title which arise after the date
of the Title Commitment, other than any such liens, exceptions or
encumbrances created by, through or under the Tenant (collectively, the
"Required Title Clearance Matters"). If Seller fails or refuses to cause the
Required Title Clearance Matters to be discharged prior to Closing,
Buyer shall have the right to deduct from the Purchase Price any amounts
required to discharge or remove to Buyers satisfaction all Required Title
Clearance Matters. If after the date of the Title Commitment, the Title
Company revises the Title Commitment or the surveyor revises the Survey to
add or modify exceptions which arise after the date of the Title Commitment,
other than any such exceptions created by, through or under the Tenant, each
such matter shall be deemed to be a Required Title Clearance Matter. In
addition to Required Title Clearance Matters, Seller shall be obligated to use
commercially reasonable efforts to discharge or remove from title, or, in the
event such matters were created by, through or under Tenant, to cause Tenant
to discharge or remove from title, prior to Closing all matters which would in
Buyers reasonable discretion, either (a) unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the Buyers intended business operations at the Property or (b)
have a material adverse impact on the value of the Property, but specifically
excluding the Leases (collectively, the "Material Title Objections"). Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any Material Title Objections as soon as is
reasonably practicable following Buyers receipt of the Title Commitment. In
the event Seller fails to cause the Material Title Objections to be discharged
prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at
any time prior to Closing upon the delivery of written notice to Seller (a
"Material Title Termination Notice"), in which event (i) this Agreement shall
be null and void and neither party shall have any further obligation to the
other, except as expressly set forth herein, and (ii) at the closing of the
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Seller shall be obligated to
execute and deliver, and cause the Tenant to execute and deliver, one (1)
fully-executed original Landlord Estoppel and Lease Amendment in the form
attached hereto as Appendix 2.4. The terms of this Section 2.4 shall expressly
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



-5-  2.5 _Service Contracts_. Unless otherwise elected by Buyer, Buyer shall
assume the Service Contracts (the "Accepted Service Contracts") at Closing.
Buyer will assume the obligations arising from and after the Closing Date
under the Accepted Service Contracts that are not in default as of the Closing
Date. Seller shall terminate at Closing any Service Contracts that are not so
assumed by Buyer.

2.6 _CCRs_. If the Property is subject to a declaration of covenants,
conditions and restrictions or similar instrument ("CCRs") governing or
affecting the use, operation, maintenance, management or improvement of such
Property, then as a condition to Buyers obligation to close, at Closing,
Seller: (i) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver
into the escrow estoppel certificates, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, from the declarant, association, committee, agent
and/or other person or entity having governing or approval rights under the
CCRs, and (ii) shall execute and deliver into the escrow a recordable
assignment, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, assigning to Buyer
any and all developer, declarant or other related rights or interests of
Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) in or under the CCRs.

 

2.7 _Approval_. Buyers obligations hereunder are expressly subject to Buyers
approval of the Property in all respects, including, without limitation,
title, economic feasibility, financing, zoning, the local government
comprehensive plan, redevelopment potential, structural components of any
improvements, governmental restrictions and requirements, availability of
utilities, physical condition, subsoil conditions, environmental matters and
such other matters as may be of concern to Buyer. Buyer shall have until the
Closing Date in which to determine whether the Property is acceptable to
Buyer, in its sole discretion, in all respects. If Buyer finds the Property
to be unacceptable and elects not to proceed with the transaction contemplated
hereby, Buyer shall have right to terminate this Agreement for any or no
reason as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion by written notice to
such effect given to Seller and Escrow Holder at any time prior to the Closing
Date.

_ARTICLE 3: AS-IS CONDITION OF PROPERTY_

3.1 _Condition of Property_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i) that Buyer shall accept
the Property in "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition with all faults and defects,

and regulations to the extent the same are the responsibility of the landlord
under the Leases, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Tenant to maintain the Property in substantially its current condition and in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to the extent the same

comply with the preceding sentence, Seller shall not make any material
alterations to the Property or any portion thereof or consent to the Tenant
making any material alterations to the Property or any portion thereof without
Buyers prior written consent. Seller will perform its obligations under all
Leases, Service Contracts and other agreements that may affect the Property.

(b) _New Contracts_. Seller shall not, without Buyers prior written consent

obligations under this Agreement to be unsatisfied.

4.2 _Damage_. Risk of loss up to and including the Closing shall be borne by
Seller. Seller shall promptly give Buyer written notice of any damage to the
Property, describing such damage, stating whether such damage and loss of

interest, if any, in and to any insurance proceeds (including any rent loss
insurance applicable to any period on and after the Closing Date) due Seller

Buyer shall assume responsibility for such repair. To the extent Seller has
incurred reasonable market based costs in effecting the repairs requested and

costs. In the event of any damage to or destruction of the Property or portion
thereof which is not covered by existing insurance, Seller hereby agrees that
(a) it shall not exercise any termination right it may have as Landlord under
the Leases, including without limitation Section 9 thereof, and (b) promptly
following any such uninsured casualty, Seller shall exercise its right as
Landlord under said Section 9 of the Leases to require Tenant to pay the cost
of repairing or restoring such damage or destruction, and, if the total cost

being a day of income and expense to Buyer. Credits to Buyer shall be credited
against the Purchase Price to be paid as provided in _Section 1.3_ and, if
such amount is exhausted, shall be paid in cash by Seller to Buyer at the
Closing. Post-closing re-prorations and adjustments shall be paid in cash.

(a) _Taxes and Assessments_. Buyer shall receive a credit for any accrued but
unpaid real estate taxes and assessments (" _Taxes_ ") (including without
limitation any assessments imposed by private covenant) applicable to any
period before the Closing Date, even if such taxes and assessments are not

required to be paid by the tenants under any Leases. Buyer shall receive from
Seller a credit for any special assessments which are levied or charged
against the Property with respect to any infrastructure improvements
specifically made to serve the Property, whether or not then due and payable
(but excluding any special assessments payable in installments to the extent
any such installment is not yet due and payable), but only to the extent any
such amounts are not otherwise required to be paid by the tenants under any
Leases. Any other special assessments not otherwise required to be paid by
the tenants under any Leases shall be prorated only for the year of Closing.
The credit received under this _Section 6.1(a)_ shall not be duplicative of
any credit received under _Section 6.1(c)_ which is specifically allocable
to such items.

(b) _Collected Rent_. Buyer shall receive from Seller a credit for any rent
and other income (and any applicable state or local tax on rent) under Leases
collected by Seller before Closing that applies to any period after Closing.
Uncollected rent and other uncollected income shall not be prorated at

to Sellers period of ownership. Buyer shall bill and use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect such rent arrearages in the ordinary course of
business, but shall not be obligated to engage a collection agency or take
legal action to collect any rent arrearages. Seller shall not have the right
to seek collection of any rents or other income applicable to any period
before the Closing. Any rent or other income received by Seller after

(d) _Other Revenues and Income_. At Closing, Seller shall pay to or at the
direction of Buyer any and all revenues and income in connection with the
operation at the Property not covered above and collected by or on behalf of
Seller before the Closing and applicable to Buyers period of ownership, and
if such amount cannot be determined at Closing, such payment shall be based
upon an estimate. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to make a final
determination of such amount and make an appropriate adjusting payment within
thirty (30) days after Closing. In addition, each party shall promptly remit
or cause to be remitted to the other any such revenues and income collected by
such party after Closing and applicable to the other partys period of
ownership.

6.2 _Post-Closing Corrections_. Either party shall be entitled to a post-
Closing adjustment for any incorrect proration or adjustment, provided such
adjustment is claimed by such party within one year after Closing. No other
expense related to the ownership or operation of the Property shall be charged

obligations expressly assumed by Buyer.

6.3 _Utilities_. Except for utilities which are in the name of and billed
directly to tenants, Seller shall cause the meters, if any, for utilities to
be read the day on which the Closing Date occurs and to pay the bills rendered
on the basis of such readings. If any such meter reading for any utility is
not available, then adjustment therefor shall be made on the basis of the most
recently issued bills therefor which are based on meter readings no earlier
than thirty (30) days before the Closing Date; and such adjustment shall be
reprorated when the next utility bills are received. The credit received under
this _Section 6.3_ shall not be duplicative of any credit received under
_Section 6.1(c)_ which is specifically allocable to such items.

6.4 _Service Contracts_. Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall receive a
credit for regular charges under Accepted Service Contracts paid and

amounts owing under those Service Contracts that are not Accepted Service
Contracts.

closing charges and any cancellation fee, (ii) one-half of the cost of the
Title Commitment, the Survey and the Endorsements (including extended
coverage), and (iii) the costs associated with Buyers due diligence
activities. Seller shall pay (i) one-half of the Escrow Agents escrow fee,
closing charges and any cancellation fee, (ii) the cost of the Title Policy
(standard coverage), one-half of the cost of the Title Commitment and the
Endorsements (including extended coverage), and if

 



-16-   Closing occurs, one-half of the cost of the Survey, and (iii) all recording

other that they have not dealt with any real estate broker, sales person or
finder in connection with this transaction. Except as expressly set forth
above, in the event of any claim for brokers or finders fees or commissions

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the other party from and against any such claim
based upon any actual or alleged statement, representation or agreement of the
indemnifying party. This provision shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

notice of the circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach within said
Survival Period, and have brought an action thereon within six (6) months of
the expiration of said Survival Period.

_ARTICLE 8: DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_

 

8.1 _Seller s Default_. If this transaction fails to close as a result of
Sellers default (all conditions to Sellers obligations having been
satisfied or waived), Buyer shall be entitled to such remedies for breach of
contract as may be available at law and in equity, including without
limitation, the remedy of specific performance. If, after Sellers default,
Buyer elects not to proceed with the Closing, then Seller will, on demand,
reimburse Buyer for all expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with this
Agreement, including all due diligence expenses. Any default by Tenant
under the Merger Agreement shall be deemed to be a default of Seller
hereunder.

8.2 _Buyer s Default_. If this transaction fails to close due to the default
of Buyer (all conditions to Buyers obligations having been satisfied or
waived), then Sellers sole remedy in such event shall be to terminate this
Agreement, Seller waiving all other rights or remedies in the event of such
default by Buyer. Any default by DKC Acquisition Corp. under the Merger
Agreement shall be deemed to be a default of Buyer hereunder.

8.3 _Other Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated due to the default of a
party, then the defaulting party shall pay any fees due to the Escrow Agent
and any fees due to the Title Company for cancellation of the Title
Commitment.

8.4 _Termination of Merger Agreement_. In the event the Merger Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then this Agreement shall simultaneously terminate
without the need for further action by either party, in which event this
Agreement shall be null and void and neither party shall have any further
obligation to the other.

_ARTICLE 9: INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.1 _Seller s Indemnity_. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
harmless from any liability, claim, demand, loss, expense or damage
(collectively, " _loss_ ") that is: (a)

 



-20-   asserted by any person or entity against Buyer arising from any act or
omission of Seller, its agents, employees or contractors or otherwise arising
out of the ownership or operation of the Property first arising or occurring
prior to the Closing (but specifically excluding any such loss arising out of
the use or operation of the Property by the Tenant first arising or occurring
prior to the Closing); or (b) arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any
of Sellers representations and warranties set forth herein or (c) arising
from any breach by Seller of any obligation related to the Property other than
those obligations which by this Agreement, or any closing delivery,
specifically becomes the obligation of Buyer.

9.2 _Buyer s Indemnity_. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless of and from any loss that is: (a) asserted by any person or entity
against, Seller arising from any act or omission of Buyer or the Tenant, their
respective agents, employees or contractors or otherwise arising out of the
ownership or operation of the Property first arising or occurring on or after
the Closing; or (b) arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any of Buyers
representations or warranties set forth herein or (c) arising from any breach
by Buyer of any obligation of Buyer related to the Property which by this
Agreement, or any closing delivery, specifically becomes the obligation of
Buyer.

9.3 _Procedure_. The following provisions govern all actions for indemnity
under this Article 8 and any other provision of this Agreement. Promptly after
receipt by an indemnitee of notice of any claim, such indemnitee will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnitor, deliver to the
indemnitor written notice thereof and the indemnitor shall have the right to
participate in and, if the indemnitor agrees in writing that it will be
responsible for any costs, expenses, judgments, damages, and losses incurred
by the indemnitee with respect to such claim, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that
an indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees
and expenses to be paid by the indemnitee, if the indemnitee reasonably
believes that representation of such indemnitee by the counsel retained by the
indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between such indemnitee and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding. The failure of indemnitee to deliver written
notice to the indemnitor within a reasonable time after indemnitee receives
notice of any such claim shall relieve such indemnitor of any liability to the
indemnitee under this indemnity only if and to the extent that such failure is
prejudicial to the indemnitors ability to defend such action, and the
omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnitor will not relieve it of
any liability that it may have to any indemnitee other than under this
indemnity. If an indemnitee settles a claim without the prior written consent
of the indemnitor, then the indemnitor shall be released from liability with
respect to such claim unless the indemnitor has unreasonably withheld such
consent.

9.4 _Survivability_. The obligations of the parties under this _Article 9_
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the Survival Period. Seller
and Buyer shall have the right to bring an action for indemnification
hereunder if they give the other party written notice of the circumstances
giving rise to the indemnified claim within said Survival Period, and have
brought an action thereon within six (6) months of the expiration of said
Survival Period.

_ARTICLE 10: MISCELLANEOUS_

 



-21-  10.1 _Parties Bound_. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other, and any such prohibited assignment shall
be void; provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement without
Sellers consent to an Affiliate. Buyer shall not be relieved of its
obligations under this Agreement in the event of such assignment. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the respective legal representatives, successors, assigns, heirs, and
devises of the parties.

 

10.2 _Headings_. The article and paragraph headings of this Agreement are for
convenience only and in no way limit or enlarge the scope or meaning of the
language hereof.

10.3 _Invalidity and Waiver_. If any portion of this Agreement is held
invalid or inoperative, then so far as is reasonable and possible the
remainder of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and operative, and, to the
greatest extent legally possible, effect shall be given to the intent
manifested by the portion held invalid or inoperative. The failure by either
party to enforce against the other any term or provision of this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such partys right to enforce against
the other party the same or any other such term or provision in the future.

10.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall, in all respects, be
governed, construed, applied, and enforced in accordance with the law of the
state in which the Real Property is located.

10.5  _Survival_. The provisions of this Agreement that contemplate
performance after the Closing, the obligations of the parties not fully
performed at the Closing, and all indemnities set forth in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and shall not be deemed to be merged into or waived
by the instruments of Closing.

10.6 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement is not intended to give or
confer any benefits, rights, privileges, claims, actions, or remedies to any
person or entity as a third party beneficiary, decree, or otherwise.

 

10.7 _Entirety and Amendments_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
relating to the Property. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only
by an instrument in writing executed by the party against whom enforcement is
sought.

 

10.8 _Time_. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.

 

10.9 _Confidentiality_. Seller shall make no public announcement or other
disclosure of this Agreement or any information related to this Agreement to
outside brokers or third parties, before or after the Closing, without the
prior written specific consent of Buyer; provided, however, that Seller may
make disclosure of this Agreement to its lenders, creditors, officers,
employees and agents as necessary to perform its obligations hereunder.

10.10 _Enforcement Expenses_. Should either party employ attorneys to enforce
any of the provisions hereof, the party against whom any final judgment is
entered agrees to pay the prevailing party all reasonable costs, charges, and
expenses, including attorneys fees and costs, expended or incurred in
connection therewith.

 



-22-  10.11 _Notices_. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be served on the parties at the addresses set forth in
_Appendix 9.11_. Any such notices shall be either (a) sent by overnight
delivery using a nationally recognized overnight courier, in which case notice
shall be deemed delivered one business day after deposit with such courier,
(b) sent by certified or regular U.S. mail, postage prepaid, in which case
notice shall be deemed delivered two business days after deposit in such
mails, (c) sent by facsimile, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered
upon the mechanical confirmation of delivery, or (d) sent by personal
delivery, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered upon receipt or
refusal of delivery. A partys address may be changed by written notice to
the other party; provided, however, that no notice of a change of address
shall be effective until actual receipt of such notice. Copies of notices are
for informational purposes only, and a failure to give or receive copies of
any notice shall not be deemed a failure to give notice. Notices given by
counsel to Buyer shall be deemed given by Buyer and notices given by counsel
to Seller shall be deemed given by Seller.

 

10.12 _Construction_. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their
counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and the documents to be
executed at the Closing and agree that the normal rule of construction to the
effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement, the
documents to be delivered at Closing or any exhibits or amendments thereto.

10.13 _Calculation of Time Periods_. Unless otherwise specified, in computing
any period of time described herein, the day of the act or event after which
the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included and the last
day of the period so computed is to be included at, unless such last day is a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for national banks in the location where the
Property is located, in which event the period shall run until the end of the
next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The last day
of any period of time described herein shall be deemed to end at 5 p.m. C.S.T.

10.14 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and
all of such counterparts shall constitute one Agreement. To facilitate
execution of this Agreement, the parties may execute and exchange by
telephone facsimile counterparts of the signature pages.

10.15 _Further Assurances_. In addition to the acts and deeds recited herein
and contemplated to be performed, executed and/or delivered by either party at
Closing, each party agrees to perform, execute and deliver, but without any
obligation to incur any additional liability or expense, on or after the
Closing any further deliveries and assurances as may be reasonably necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to further perfect the
conveyance, transfer and assignment of the Property to Buyer.

10.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

10.17 _Bulk Sales_. If any applicable provisions of law require that any state
or local taxation authorities be notified of the transactions contemplated
herein, or if clearance is required 

 



-23-   of such authorities, each in order to permit the transfer of the Property as
contemplated herein without liability to Buyer for any state or local taxes
required to be paid or collected by Seller prior to the Closing Date, it
shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of Buyer hereunder that all
such notification and clearance requirements shall have been complied with and
the Buyer shall have received the requisite clearances and releases from
further liability. Seller shall, within ten (10) days after the Effective Date
make all filings necessary to obtain such clearances, and shall
contemporaneously provide Buyer with copies of all such filings.

 

10.18 _Mutual Execution_. Until this Agreement has been dully executed by both
Buyer and Seller and a fully executed copy has been delivered to each of
Buyer and Seller (which may occur by facsimile transmission), this Agreement
shall not be legally binding against the parties. Execution of this Agreement
by Buyer shall constitute an offer to acquire the Property on the terms and
conditions set forth herein but, if not executed by Seller within five (5)
days after delivery by Buyer, it may be withdrawn by Buyer in its discretion
at any time thereafter.

 

10.19 _1031 Exchange_. Buyer may consummate the purchase of the Property as
part of a so-called like kind exchange (the " _Exchange_ ") pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Code, provided that: (1) the Closing shall not be delayed
or affected by reason of the Exchange nor shall the consummation or
accomplishment of the Exchange be a condition precedent or condition
subsequent to Buyers obligations under this Agreement; (2) Buyer shall effect
the Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this
Agreement, to a qualified intermediary; (3) Seller shall not be required to
take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished property or
be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of
consummating the Exchange; (4) Buyer shall pay any additional costs that
would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had Buyer not
consummated its purchase through the Exchange; and (5) Buyer shall indemnify,
defend, and hold Seller harmless from or against all claims, losses, costs,
damages, liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection
therewith. Sellers acquiescence to the Exchange shall not affect or diminish
in any manner its rights hereunder nor shall Seller be responsible for
compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to Buyer that the Exchange in
fact complies with § 1031 of the Code.

 _LANDLORD ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE AND LEASE AMENDMENT_

The undersigned LAMBDA PROPERTIES II, LLC, a California limited liability
company ("Landlord") hereby delivers this Landlord Estoppel Certificate and
Lease Amendment (this "Certificate") as of , 2012,
certifying to and agreeing with ONE LAMBDA, INC., a California
corporation ("Tenant") as follows:

1\. Landlord is the landlord under that certain "Standard
Industrial/Commercial Single-Tenant LeaseNet" with Tenant, dated as of
September 23, 2010 (as the same may have been amended, including without
limitation as set forth herein, the "Lease"), affecting certain real property
(the "Property") located at 21200 Oxnard Street, Woodland Hills, California,
as more particularly described in the Lease. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Lease.

 

2\. The Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified, amended
or supplemented in any way. Landlord is not holding a security deposit under
the Lease.

3\. Tenant is not in default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of the Lease and no event has occurred and no situation exists which would,
with the passage of time, or the giving of notice or both, constitute a
default by the Tenant under the Lease.

4\. The term of the Lease is currently set to expire on December 31, 2020.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that (a) Tenant shall have the right to terminate the Lease
prior to the then-scheduled expiration date, which right shall be exercisable
by Tenant upon the delivery of at least twelve (12) months prior written
notice to Landlord any time after September 1, 2014, and (b) Tenants right
to extend the Lease term shall be exercisable by Tenant upon the delivery of
not less than three (3) nor more than twelve (12) months prior written notice
to Landlord.

 

5\. All sums due and payable by Tenant to Landlord under the Lease have been
paid in full through and including the date of this Certificate. Landlord
confirms that the current annual rent payable under the Lease is $504,960.00.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, the annual
rent payable for the remainder of the initial term of the Lease
(i.e., through December 31, 2020, unless sooner terminated) shall remain at
$504,960.00. Annual rent payable during the entire extension term, if
exercised, shall be at Market Rental Value as determined prior to the
commencement of such extension term in accordance with the terms of the
Lease.

6\. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Lease, and by execution hereof, Landlord
hereby consents to any assignment of the Lease effectuated by the
transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and
among Tenant, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., DKC Acquisition Corp. and Emiko
Terasaki dated on or about the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement").

7\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that Tenant shall have no obligation to remove any Alterations,
Lessee Owned Alterations  or Utility Installations which are in the Premises as of the date of this
Certificate, except to the extent listed on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto.

 

8\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that Tenants environmental and surrender obligations under
Lease shall in no event be deemed to include any obligation in excess of the
standards imposed by applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

9\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Landlord
hereby agrees that Tenants obligations under Section 7.3(c) of the Lease to
surrender the Premises on the Expiration Date or any earlier termination date
of the Lease, shall in no event be deemed to require Tenant to surrender the
Premises in a better condition than the Premises are in as of the date of this
Certificate, reasonable wear and tear excepted. 

10\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease,
including without limitation Sections 2.3 and 7.1 thereof, in the event that
any Capital Expenditure is required to made by either party pursuant to the
terms of the Lease and the useful life of such Capital Expenditure extends
beyond the then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Lease, then in such event
Landlord shall be obligated to pay the entire cost of such Capital Expenditure
and Tenant shall only be obligated to pay, together with monthly rental
payments during the remaining term of the Lease, the Charge-Off Amount as
defined herein. As used herein, the term "Charge-Off Amount" shall mean an
amount equal to the product of (a) the cost of such Capital Expenditure,
multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the
denominator of which is the number of months in the useful life of the
Capital Expenditure so made, calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

11\. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, then the
terms of this Certificate, including any amendments to the Lease contained
herein, shall simultaneously terminate without the need for further action by
either party, in which event this Certificate shall be deemed null and void
and of no force or effect, and neither party shall have any obligation to the
other in connection herewith.

 

12\. Landlord acknowledges that this Certificate is intended to be relied upon
by Tenant and by the parties to the Merger Agreement. 

 



-2-  The undersigned hereby EXECUTE this Certificate as of the date first set forth
above.
