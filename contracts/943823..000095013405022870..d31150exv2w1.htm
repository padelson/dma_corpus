plans (as defined in Section&nbsp;3(2) of ERISA) and all other bonus, stock option, restricted stock

modifications thereto communicated to employees, and (vi)&nbsp;the two most recent annual and periodic
accountings of related plan assets. The Company has delivered to Holdings and Merger Sub a correct

nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agents has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any &#147;prohibited
transaction&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code or Section&nbsp;406 of ERISA), which could result
in the imposition of either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed
by Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Employee Plan. Except as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.9</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

&#147;multiemployer plan&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;3(37) of ERISA) or which is subject to Section&nbsp;412 of
the Code or Section&nbsp;302 or Title IV of ERISA. No Employee Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending beyond their retirement
or other termination of service, other than coverage mandated by applicable law. No condition
exists that would prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any
Employee Plan providing health or medical benefits in respect of any active employee of the Company

Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes by virtue
of Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code. Except as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.9</U> of the Company

Benefit Reserve Trust established in respect of the Company&#146;s Select Executive Retirement Plan have
a fair market value not less than the benefit liabilities under the Company&#146;s Select Executive
Retirement Plan and may be liquidated within three business days at such fair market value (less
normal transaction costs). The maximum amount of cash compensation and benefits that could be
payable by the Company or any Subsidiary under all Employee Plans and any other compensatory plan,
program or agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, as a result (in whole or in
part) of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not exceed $17.5&nbsp;million (based upon
the assumptions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.9</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule). No &#147;leased
employees,&#148; as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of the Code, perform services for the Company
or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has used the services of workers
provided by third party contract labor suppliers, temporary employees, such &#147;leased employees,&#148; or
individuals who have provided services as independent contractors to an extent that would
reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any Employee Plan or the imposition of
penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Employee Plan by the Internal Revenue Service, the
Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity. Except for determination letters issued by
the Internal Revenue Service with respect to plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code, neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor
any ERISA Affiliate is a party to any agreement or understanding, whether written or unwritten,
with the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation in regard to any Employee Plan. No representations or communications, oral or written,
with respect to the participation, eligibility for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual or coverage
under any Employee Plan have been made to current or former employees or directors (or any of their
representative
s or beneficiaries) of the Company or any Subsidiary that are not in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Employee Plans.
