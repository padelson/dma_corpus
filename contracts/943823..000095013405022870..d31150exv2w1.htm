At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), or any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"): 

    

 (a) (i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for, the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to $18.05 per share of Company Common Stock, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

 (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Holdings and Merger Sub-Owned Company Common Stock_.

If any such holder of Company Common Stock shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holder shall be treated, at the Companys sole discretion, as a share of Company Common Stock that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section 1.6(a)(i)_. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. The Company shall give prompt notice to Holdings and Merger Sub of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock and of attempted withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law, and Holdings and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

 SECTION 1.7. _Exchange of Certificates and Warrants_. 

    

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. From time to time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, when and as required, deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Holdings (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Warrants, for exchange in accordance with this Article I through the Exchange Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Warrant Consideration (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation, make payments of the Merger Consideration and the Warrant Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure for Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(i)_: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(i)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of such Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Certificate (other than a Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(i)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _Exchange Procedure for Warrants_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Warrant whose Warrant is converted into the right to receive a New Warrant pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Warrants shall pass, only upon delivery of the Warrants to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Warrants in exchange for the New Warrants. Upon surrender of a Warrant for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Warrant shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the New Warrant into which such Warrant shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_, and the Warrant so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Warrants upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of such Warrant which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, issuance of a New Warrant may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Warrant so surrendered is registered, if such Warrant shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such New Warrant shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Warrant to a Person other than the registered holder of such Warrant or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7(c)_, each Warrant shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the New Warrant into which the Warrant shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Warrants_. All consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to any obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized or made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock which remain unpaid or unsatisfied at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, the Certificates or Warrants are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article I_, except as otherwise provided by applicable law. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends or other distributions which such holder may be due on Company Common Stock, under applicable law. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, shareholders, agent or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, "affiliate" of a Person means a Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the first mentioned Person. 

   

 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "control" (including the terms "controlled by" and "under common control with") means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of stock, as trustee or executor, by contract, credit arrangement or otherwise. 

   

 (g) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted 

   ##### 

  

   

and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 1.8. _Stock Plans_. 

    

 (a) Not later than the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "Options") granted under any of the Companys stock option plans listed in _Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each as amended (collectively, the "Option Plans") or granted otherwise, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive from Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price thereof and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of applicable withholding Taxes). 

   

 (b) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and to the extent permitted by the Option Plans, (i) the Company shall cause the Option Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time and cause the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant by the Company of any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate and have no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of Options or any participant in the Option Plans or anyone other than Holdings shall hold or have any right to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof. 

  

 SECTION 1.9. _Time and Place of Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by Holdings and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will be held at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first business day following the date that all of the conditions precedent specified in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions)

For purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means any effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development or circumstance that, individually or together with any other effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development or circumstance, (A) is or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on or change in the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, business, prospects, operations, results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Company and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) could reasonably be expected to prohibit, restrict or materially impede or curtail the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development or circumstance is caused by or results from any of the following, it shall not be taken into account in determining whether there has been a "Material Adverse Effect": (i) changes in U.S. economic conditions, or (ii) general changes or developments in the restaurant industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate unless, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such changes or developments referred to therein would reasonably be expected to have a materially disproportionate impact on the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, business, operations, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities

 SECTION 3.9. _Employee Benefit Plans_. _Section 3.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), employee pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and all other bonus, stock option, restricted stock grant, stock purchase, benefit, profit sharing, savings, retirement, disability, insurance, incentive, deferred compensation and other similar fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or any other entity, whether or not incorporated, that together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" for purposes of Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate") for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee, director or other independent contractor of, or consultant to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the "Employee Plans"). The Company has delivered to Holdings and Merger Sub true and complete copies of (i) all Employee Plans, together with all amendments thereto, (ii) the latest Internal Revenue Service determination letters obtained with respect to any Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or 501(a) of the Code, (iii) the two most recent annual actuarial valuation reports, if any, (iv) the two most recently filed Forms 5500 together with Schedule A and/or B thereto, if any, (v) the "summary plan description" (as defined in ERISA), if any, and all modifications thereto communicated to employees, and (vi) the two most recent annual and periodic accountings of related plan assets. The Company has delivered to Holdings and Merger Sub a correct and complete list of each Option, including the holder, date of grant, exercise price and number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto. Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could result in the imposition of either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan. Except as set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all Employee Plans have been approved and administered in accordance with their terms and are in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable requirements prescribed by all statutes, orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect with respect to such Employee Plans, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code and there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims, lawsuits or arbitrations (other than routine claims for benefits), relating to any of the Employee Plans, or the assets of any trust for any Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trusts created thereunder intended to be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, either (i) has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to such effect or (ii) is still within the "remedial amendment period," as described in Section 401(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. All contributions or payments required to be made or accrued before  the Effective Time under the terms of any Employee Plan will have been made by the Effective Time. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates contributes, nor within the six-year period ending 

    ##### 

  

 

on the date hereof has any of them contributed or been obligated to
contribute, to any plan, program or agreement which is a "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or which is subject to Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA. No Employee Plan provides
medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not
insured) for employees or former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than coverage mandated by applicable law. No
condition exists that would prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from amending or terminating any Employee Plan providing health or medical
benefits in respect of any active employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no amounts payable under any Employee Plan or otherwise
will fail to be deductible to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 162(m) or
280G of the Code. Except as set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due any such employee, director or officer or
(iii) require the Company to place in trust or otherwise set aside any
amounts in respect of severance pay or otherwise. The assets of the
Companys Benefit Reserve Trust established in respect of the Companys
Select Executive Retirement Plan have a fair market value not less than the
benefit liabilities under the Companys Select Executive Retirement Plan and
may be liquidated within three business days at such fair market value
(less normal transaction costs). The maximum amount of cash compensation and
benefits that could be payable by the Company or any Subsidiary under all
Employee Plans and any other compensatory plan, program or agreement to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, as a result (in whole or in part)
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not exceed $17.5
million (based upon the assumptions set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule). No "leased employees," as that term is defined
in Section 414(n) of the Code, perform services for the Company or any
Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has used the services of
workers provided by third party contract labor suppliers, temporary
employees, such "leased employees," or individuals who have provided services
as independent contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification of any Employee Plan or the imposition
of penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Employee Plan by the
Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, or any other Governmental
Entity. Except for determination letters issued by the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code, neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate is a
party to any agreement or understanding, whether written or unwritten, with
the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation in regard to any Employee Plan. No representations or
communications, oral or written, with respect to the participation,
eligibility for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual or coverage under any
Employee Plan have been made to current or former employees or directors (or
any of their representative s or beneficiaries) of the Company or any
Subsidiary that are not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Employee Plans. 

   

 SECTION 3.10. _Information Supplied_. None of the information to be supplied by the Company, specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to the holders of the Company Common Stock and on the date 

    ##### 

  

 

of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If, at any time prior
to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, any event with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, shall occur which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement, such event shall be so
described by the Company, and provided in writing to Merger Sub. All
documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent relating
to the Company or its Subsidiaries or other information supplied by the
Company for inclusion therein, will comply as to form, in all material
respects, with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the respective rules
and regulations thereunder, and each such document required to be filed with
any Governmental Entity will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of applicable law as to the information required to be contained
therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation
or warranty with respect to the information supplied or to be supplied
by either Merger Sub or Holdings for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. 

   

 SECTION 3.11. _Conduct of Business; Permits_. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is not being (and since January 1, 2002 has not been) conducted in default or violation of any term, condition or provision of (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company or the comparable charter documents or by-laws of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease or other instrument or agreement of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) any federal, state, county, regional, municipal, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, concession, grant, franchise, permit or license or other governmental authorization or approval applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, including, without limitation, Regulatory Laws, except, with respect to the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The material permits, licenses, approvals, certifications and authorizations from any Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, those obtained under Regulatory Laws (collectively, "Permits") held by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are valid and sufficient in all material respects for all business presently conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written claim or notice nor has any knowledge indicating that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with the terms of any such Permits and with all requirements, standards and procedures of the Governmental Entity which issued them, or any limitation or proposed limitation on any Permit, except where the failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Permits will lapse, terminate or otherwise cease to be valid as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

      #####

extent required, is then represented by bona fide commitment letters (such
more favorable Acquisition Proposal hereinafter referred to as a "Superior
Proposal"; _provided_ , _that_ , for purposes of the definition of Superior
Proposal, the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned below,
except that references to "15% or more" shall be deemed to be references to

conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The Company shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to immediately notify Holdings and Merger
Sub if any proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or
any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal. Each notice shall contain the name of any Person making
any such proposal, requesting such information or seeking such negotiations
or discussions and a summary of the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers and thereafter the Company shall keep Holdings and
Merger Sub informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.
The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform
the Persons referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 4.2_ of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 4.2_ and in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Co mpany will promptly provide to Holdings and Merger Sub any
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to any other
Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal which was not previously
delivered to Holdings and Merger Sub. The Company shall and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to promptly return or destroy all
written confidential information heretofore   ##### 

  

  

  

furnished to such Person (whether then in the possession of such Person or its
advisors or representatives) by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company agrees not to release any third party from or waive
any provisions of confidentiality in any confidentiality agreement to which
the Company is a party or by which it is bound. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 4.2_ by any officer, director, affiliate, employee, agent,
financial advisor or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.2_. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal, offer or
indication of interest from any Person (other than by or on behalf of Merger

or more beneficial ownership (as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if

determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its financial advisors and legal counsel) that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Board of Directors may withdraw its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger solely in order to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement prior to the time the Company shareholders shall have approved the Merger, providing for the consummation of a transaction with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 7.1(f)(ii)_ and _Section 7.2(b)_, but only if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its financial advisor and legal counsel) that the Board of Directors would breach its fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law without taking such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors shall have (1) given Holdings and Merger Sub at least five business days prior written notice that the Company intends to take such action and provided Holdings and Merger Sub with a reasonable opportunity to respond to any such Superior Proposal (which response could include a proposal to revise the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby) and (2) fully considered any such response by Holdings and Merger Sub and concluded that, notwithstanding such response, such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby, as the terms hereof may be proposed to be revised by such response.
