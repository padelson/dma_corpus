                                    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of
                           January 15, 2001, among NESTLE HOLDINGS, INC., a
                           Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), NEWCO MERGER
                           COMPANY, a Missouri corporation ("SUB") and a direct
                           wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and RALSTON PURINA
                           COMPANY, a Missouri corporation (the "COMPANY").


                  WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and
the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

                  WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and
the Company have approved the merger (the "Merger") of Sub into the Company, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby
each issued share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company
(the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") not owned directly by Parent or the Company shall
be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash;

                  WHEREAS in connection with and as an inducement to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, Nestle S.A. ("NESTLE")
has executed and delivered to the Company a guarantee of the obligations of
Parent (the "GUARANTEE"); and

                  WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.


                  NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

                  SECTION 1.01. THE MERGER. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General and
Business Corporation Law of Missouri ("MG&BCL"), Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03). At the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION"). At the election of Parent, any direct or indirect wholly
<PAGE>   6
                                                                               2

owned subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger. In such event, the parties shall execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing.

                  SECTION 1.02. CLOSING. The closing (the "CLOSING") of the
Merger shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day
following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by the
applicable party) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing, but
subject to their satisfaction at such time), or at such other place, time and
date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "CLOSING DATE".

                  SECTION 1.03. EFFECTIVE TIME. Prior to the Closing, Parent
shall prepare, and on the Closing Date Parent shall file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Missouri, articles of merger or other appropriate
documents (in any such case, the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the MG&BCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the MG&BCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with such Secretary of State, or
at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger as permitted by the MG&BCL (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

                  SECTION 1.04. EFFECTS. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 351.450 of the MG&BCL.

                  SECTION 1.05. ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. (a) The
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the
Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A, and, as so amended, such
Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.05).

                  (b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

                                                                               3

                  SECTION 1.06. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The
officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and such
additional officers as Parent shall designate in writing prior to the Effective
Time, until such time as their successors shall be duly elected or appointed in
accordance with the MG&BCL or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.


                                   ARTICLE II

                       EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

                  SECTION 2.01. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger, by operation of Law and without any action on the part
of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Sub:

                  (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (b) CANCELATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
owned by any subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Sub) shall
automatically be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. (1) Subject to
Sections 2.01(b) and 2.01(d), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").
<PAGE>   8
                                                                               4

                  (2) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration
upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without
interest.


                  (d) DISSENT RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares ("DISSENT SHARES") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value
of such Dissent Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 351.455 of the MG&BCL ("SECTION 351.455") shall not be converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
rather the holders of Dissent Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Dissent Shares in accordance with and subject to Section 351.455;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair value under
Section 351.455, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Dissent Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any demands
received by the Company for payment of the fair value of any shares of Company
Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.


                  SECTION 2.02. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a) PAYING AGENT.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "PAYING AGENT")
for the payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates
representing Company Common Stock and shall enter into a paying agent agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, as
and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares
of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
<PAGE>   9
                                                                               5

Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE
FUND").

                  (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock which
were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions consistent with this Agreement as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

                  (c) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
<PAGE>   10
                                                                               6

Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance
with this Article II; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent or the Paying Agent may
require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate
or ownership thereof.

                  (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay
any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior
to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and
after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

                  (e) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
months after the Effective Time (or such longer period as Parent, in its sole
discretion, shall designate) shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration and Parent shall be obligated at such time to make such
payments, subject to the provisions of Sections 447.520, 447.536, 447.539 and
447.543 of the Missouri Revised Statutes.

                  (f) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would

                                                                               7

otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 3.05), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                  (g) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Paying Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis.
Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
investments shall be held in the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

                  (h) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
(as defined in Section 3.09), or under any provision of state, local or foreign
tax Law (other than any provision of Swiss tax Law applicable solely due to the
fact that Nestle is a Swiss corporation). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.


                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the
date hereof delivered by the Company to Parent and Sub (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
LETTER") or in the Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.06) filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "FILED COMPANY SEC
DOCUMENTS") or as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

                  SECTION 3.01. ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of the
Company and each of its subsidiaries (the "COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES") is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate power
<PAGE>   12
                                                                               8

authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and
is not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in Section 9.03). The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary or the
failure to so qualify has had or is reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete
copies of the articles of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date
of this Agreement (as so amended, the "COMPANY CHARTER"), and the Bylaws of the
Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "COMPANY
BYLAWS"), and the comparable charter and organizational documents of each
Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.03) of the Company, in each case
as amended through the date of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.02. SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES; EQUITY INTERESTS. (a)
Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Significant Subsidiary
of the Company and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company have been validly

another Significant Subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another
Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages,
encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "LIENS").

                  (b) Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest
in any person which has a book value in excess of $100 million.

                  SECTION 3.03. CAPITAL STRUCTURE. (a) The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of 600,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
10,600,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (together with

no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii)
19,468,690 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its

28, 1998 (as so amended, and as further amended from time to time, the "COMPANY
RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as
successor Rights Agent. At the close of business on December 31, 2000, 2,109,080
"phantom" shares of the Company (each, a "COMPANY PHANTOM SHARE") were
outstanding. At the close of business on January 10, 2001, 177,260 outstanding

interest in, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company or any
Voting Company Debt or (ii) obligating the Company or any Significant Subsidiary
of the Company to issue, grant,

                                                                              10

extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, security,
commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are not any outstanding contractual obligations of the Company

                  (b) The Company has delivered to Parent and Sub a true and
complete list, as of January 10, 2001, of all outstanding Company Employee Stock
Options, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such

10, 2001, 11,833,070 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (as defined in Section 6.04). Each
outstanding Company Restricted Share and Company Phantom Share was issued to a
current or former employee or director of the Company. The Company has delivered
to Parent and Sub a true and complete list, as of January 10, 2001, of each
Company SAR not granted in tandem with a related Company Employee Stock Option,
which specifies its date of grant and the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock on such date (its "BASE VALUE"). As of January 10, 2001, the issued
and outstanding Company SARs which were not granted in tandem with a related
Company Employee Stock Option had a weighted average Base Value of $15.828. All
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are, and all such shares that may be

of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the MG&BCL, the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or any Contract (as defined in Section 3.05)
to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. Except as is not reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are not any options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which any Company Subsidiary (other than Significant
Subsidiaries of the Company) is a party or by which any of them is bound (i)

3.05(c)).

                  SECTION 3.04. AUTHORITY; EXECUTION AND DELIVERY;

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the
case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (as defined
in Section 3.04(c)). The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement,
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

                  (b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) determining that the
terms of the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders and (iii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, recommending that
the Company's shareholders approve this Agreement. Such resolutions are the only

contemplated by this Agreement to comply with Article Eight of the Company
Charter. In addition, the Company Board has taken all action necessary to render
(A) Section 351.407 of the MG&BCL and (B) Section 351.459 of the MG&BCL
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to Parent and Sub to the extent of this

                                                                              12

outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL").

                  SECTION 3.05. NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. (a) The execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance
with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or
guaranteed rights or entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws

                  (c) The Company and the Company Board have taken all action
necessary to (i) render the Company Rights inapplicable to this Agreement and

                  SECTION 3.06. SEC DOCUMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. The
Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(other than reports on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G) required to be filed by the

<PAGE>   18
                                                                              14

and giving effect to any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto and
information incorporated by reference therein, the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS"). As
of its respective date, except as supplemented or amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document, and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the
extent that information contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised
or superseded by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC
Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended each of
September 30, 1999 and September 30, 2000 comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as otherwise disclosed
therein) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended. Except for such liabilities and obligations as, individually
and in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, from September 30, 2000 to the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes thereto. None
of the Company Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1, 1999 been,
subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

                  SECTION 3.07. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
<PAGE>   19
                                                                              15

Company's shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting (as
defined in Section 6.01), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

                  SECTION 3.08. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. From
September 30, 2000 to the date of this Agreement, the Company has conducted its
business only in the ordinary course, and during such period there has not been:

                  (i) any event, change, effect or development that,
         individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably expected to
         have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

                  (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
         or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect
         to any Company Capital Stock or any repurchase for value by the Company
         of any Company Capital Stock, other than regular quarterly cash
         dividends with respect to the Company Common Stock in the amount of
         $0.07 per share with usual declaration, record and payment dates;

                  (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any
         Company Capital Stock or any issuance or the authorization of any
         issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in

         except in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior
         practice or as is or was required under employment agreements or Law
         which were in effect as of the date of the most recent audited
         financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents or
         which are set forth in Section 3.08 of the Company
<PAGE>   20
                                                                              16

         Disclosure Letter, (B) any granting by the Company or any Company
         Subsidiary to any Relevant Person of any material increase in severance
         or termination pay, except as was required under any employment,
         severance or termination agreements or Law which were in effect as of
         the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in
         the Filed Company SEC Documents or which are set forth in Section 3.08
         of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (C) any entry by the Company or
         any Company Subsidiary into, or any material amendment of, any
         employment, severance or termination agreement with any Relevant Person
         that materially increases the benefits payable to, or accelerates the
         payment of any material benefit to, any such Relevant Person; PROVIDED,
         that any such increases or amendments not otherwise required to be
         disclosed by this subsection (iv) do not in the aggregate increase the
         compensation, benefits or other such expenses of the Company and the
         Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, by more than 10% (excluding the
         impact of currency fluctuations) compared to the prior fiscal year;

                  (v) any material change in accounting methods, principles or
         practices by the Company or any Company Subsidiary materially affecting
         the consolidated assets, liabilities or results of operations of the
         Company, except insofar as may have been required by Law or GAAP; or

                  (vi) any material elections with respect to Taxes (as defined
         in Section 3.09) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or settlement
         or compromise by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any material
         Tax liability or refund.

                  SECTION 3.09. TAXES. (a) The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf, all
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are
true, complete and accurate in all material respects. All Taxes shown to be due
on such filed Tax Returns have been timely paid.

                  (b) The most recent financial statements contained in the
Filed Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance with
GAAP) for all Taxes payable by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the

                  (f) Since the time that the Company obtained rulings relating

knowledge of the Company no acquisition or disposition of, or transactions in

                                                                              19


the date of this Agreement, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any
material respect by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any collective
bargaining agreement or any U.S. or material foreign bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock
purchase, stock option, "phantom" stock, retirement, vacation, termination,
severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other legally
binding plan, policy, trust, arrangement or understanding providing benefits to

termination agreements or arrangements between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any Relevant Person.

                  SECTION 3.11. ERISA AND OTHER COMPLIANCE. (a) Section 3.11 of
the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of all Company Benefit Plans which
are "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes
referred to herein as "COMPANY PENSION PLANS"), "employee welfare benefit plans"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans
maintained, or contributed to, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each
case, for the benefit of any current or former employees, executive officers or
directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary employed or providing
services (or who were formerly employed or formerly provided services) in the
United States (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as the "U.S.
COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS") and all Company Foreign Plans. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "COMPANY FOREIGN PLAN" shall refer to each Company Benefit
Plan that is subject to or governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United States and that would have been treated as a U.S. Company Benefit
Plan had it covered individuals employed or providing services (or who were
formerly employed or formerly provided services) in the United States. The
Company has delivered to Parent true, complete and correct copies of each
Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plan, a
description thereof), and has used reasonable best efforts to make available to
Parent (i) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to each U.S. Company Benefit Plan (if any such
report was required), (ii) the most recent summary plan description for each
Company Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is required and
(iii) each trust agreement and group annuity contract relating to any Company
Benefit Plan. Each Company
<PAGE>   24
                                                                              20


Benefit Plan has been administered in all respects in accordance with its terms
and applicable Law, except where any failures to so administer, individually and
in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except where any failures to comply with laws,
individually and in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Foreign Plan is in
compliance with all applicable laws.

                  (b) All Company Pension Plans which are intended to meet the
requirements of Section 401(a), Section 401(k) or Section 501(a) of the Code
("U.S. QUALIFIED COMPANY PENSION PLANS") have been the subject of determination
letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company
Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter
has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been
threatened, nor has any such Company Pension Plan been amended since the date of
its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect that
would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its costs. There
is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans.

                  (c) No U.S. Qualified Company Pension Plan, other than any
Company Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "COMPANY MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLAN"), had, as of
the respective last annual valuation date for each such U.S. Qualified Company
Pension Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), and there has been no material adverse change in
the financial condition of any U.S. Qualified Company Pension Plan since its
last such annual valuation date. Except where any such liabilities, individually
and in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV
of ERISA other than liability for future Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
premiums has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"). None of any U.S. Qualified Company
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA
<PAGE>   25
                                                                              21


Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived. Except
where any such occurrences, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and
are not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA,
including the U.S. Qualified Company Pension Plans, any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such
Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA. None
of such Company Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated, and, except where
any such occurrences, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and are
not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there has not
been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA)
for which reporting has not been waived by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to any Company Benefit Plan during the last two years,
and no notice of a reportable event will be required to be filed in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred a "complete
withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections
4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections
4203 and 4205 with respect to any Multiemployer Pension Plan, except for any
such event for which any applicable withdrawal liability has been paid or
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended September
30, 2000. All contributions and premiums required to be made under the terms of
any Company Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have been timely made or have
been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Filed Company SEC Documents.

                  (d) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan, (i) no such Company Benefit Plan that is required
to be funded by its terms is unfunded or underfunded in any material respect or
funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section
419(e) of the Code) and (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group
health plan" (as such term is
<PAGE>   26
                                                                              22


defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), complies in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code. Except where
any such failures to fund, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and
are not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
Company Foreign Plan that would be an employee welfare benefit plan had it
covered individuals employed or providing services (or who were formerly
employed or formerly provided services) in the United States and that is
required to be funded by its terms is unfunded or underfunded in any material
respect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or employment,
indemnification, severance or termination agreement with any Relevant Person,
except as required by Law.

                  (e) The consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (x) entitle any Relevant Person to
severance pay, (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans or any employment,
indemnification, severance or termination agreement with any Relevant Person,
other than pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.04 or (z) result in any
breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Company Benefit Plans or
any employment, indemnification, severance or termination agreement with any
Relevant Person.

                  SECTION 3.12. LITIGATION. There is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary (and the Company is not aware of
any valid basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that has had or is reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.13. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. (a) The Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws,
including those relating to occupational health and safety, except for instances
of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and are
not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written

communication during the past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges
that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material
respect with any applicable Law which has resulted in, or is reasonably expected
to result in, any material liability. This Section 3.13(a) does not relate to
matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject of Section 3.09, or
Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 3.13(c)), which are the subject of
Section 3.13(b).

                  (b)(i) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries are,
and have been, in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, except for
instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
communication during the past two years from any person or Governmental Entity

each of the Company Subsidiaries hold, and are in compliance with, all
environmental, health and safety permits and governmental authorizations
(collectively, "ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS") required under Environmental Laws to
conduct their respective businesses, except where the failure to so obtain or
comply, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) there are no
Environmental Claims pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or against any person or
entity whose liability for any such Environmental Claim the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either
contractually or by operation of law, in each case, except for such
Environmental Claims that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and
are not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iv)
there have been no Releases of any Hazardous Material, and there is no Hazardous
Material stored on, at or under any property owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, in each case that could reasonably be likely to form the basis of
any Environmental Claim against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
except for such Environmental Claims that, individually and in the aggregate,
have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect; (v) neither the Company nor or any of the Company Subsidiaries has
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law any liabilities
or obligations that could reasonably be likely

to form the basis of any Environmental Claim that, individually or in the
aggregate, is reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and
(vi) none of the products manufactured or sold by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in any European country subject to the jurisdiction of European
Commission Law contains any ingredient or other material in quantities or
concentrations that would violate any current or proposed European Commission
Law, except as has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a Company

Section 5.02(e)), (ii) enter into any agreement providing for any Company
Takeover Proposal or (iii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information
with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide Company Takeover Proposal which did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.02(a) and which the Company Board determines, in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal (as defined in
Section 5.02(e)), and subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.02), PROVIDED that the
Company may grant a Permitted Waiver with respect thereto, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, whether
or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the
Company.

                  (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or publicly propose
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement or
the Merger, (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement providing for any Company Takeover
Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, in each case unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary obligations, the Company Board may, prior to receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the
Merger and this Agreement.

                  (c) The Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in
writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that
may reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal (including
any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to
Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company from
any third party that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Company
Takeover Proposal.

                  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required
disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, such disclosure is
necessary or advisable to comply with its obligations under applicable Law.

                  (e)  For purposes of this Agreement:

                  "COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means (i) any proposal or offer

         issuance of 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company as
         consideration for the assets or securities of another person or (iii)
         any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly,
         20% or more of the equity securities of the Company or assets
         (including equity securities of any Company Subsidiary) that represent
         20% or more of the consolidated total assets of the Company, in each
         case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  "SUPERIOR COMPANY PROPOSAL" means any proposal made by a third
         party to acquire 75% or more of the equity securities or assets of the

         of all its assets or otherwise, (i) on terms which the Company Board
         determines in good faith to be superior from a financial point of view
         to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger (after

                                                                              39



        consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor), taking
        into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
        Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the
        Merger and including in each case the risks and probabilities of
        consummation) and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed,
        taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects
        of such proposal.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

               SECTION 6.01. PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT; SHAREHOLDERS
MEETING. (a) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the execution
of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC

staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
provide promptly any information or responses to comments, or other assistance,
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. If at any time prior to
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval there shall occur any event that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company shall afford Parent the opportunity to comment upon, and
shall accept all reasonable comments to, the Proxy Statement and any amendment
or supplement thereto. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as promptly
as practicable after filing with the SEC.

               (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a

respective reasonable best efforts to take such steps as are necessary to hold
the Company

shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they give
the Company Shareholder Approval (subject to Section 5.02(b)). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to the first two sentences of this Section 6.01(b) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal.

               SECTION 6.02. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. The Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent,
and to Parent's officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, in each
case to the extent permitted by any applicable Law (including any domestic or
foreign antitrust Law) and subject to any reasonable restrictions or protocols
reasonably designed to ensure compliance with any such applicable Laws, PROVIDED
that any competitively sensitive information shall be furnished on an "outside
counsel only" basis, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that such access shall not
unreasonably disrupt the normal business operations of the Company. In addition,
the Company shall reasonably consult from time to time with Parent and Parent's
representatives during the period prior to the Effective Time to report material
operational and financial developments and the general status of ongoing
operations and financial conditions pursuant to procedures mutually agreeable to
the Company and Parent. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02
shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated December 14, 2000,
between the Company and Nestle (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

               SECTION 6.03. REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, but in any event
before the Outside Date, the Merger and the

                                                                              41

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) using
reasonable best efforts in the defense of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall (A) take all
reasonable action as requested by Parent if necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Merger or this Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, take all reasonable
action as requested by Parent if necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent agrees not to directly or
indirectly extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any litigation except with the
prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld in light of closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
or before the Outside Date. At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to
divest, hold separate or otherwise commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to its ability to retain any of the business,
services or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; PROVIDED, that
such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and
<PAGE>   46
                                                                              42

Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (and to make such other filings as are
required under Laws in foreign jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger
control matters) with respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act (or
pursuant to such foreign Laws). Each party will consult with counsel for the
other parties as to, and will permit such counsel to participate in, any
litigation referred to in clause (iii) above. Each party, acting solely through
outside counsel, will (x) promptly notify the other party of any written
communication to that party from any Governmental Entity located in the U.S.
and, to the extent practicable, outside of the U.S. and, subject to applicable
Law, if practicable, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the other
party's reasonable comments, (y) not agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and (z)
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their affiliates and their respective
representatives on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its respective
staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, except
that any materials concerning Parent's valuation of the Company, the Company's
valuation of the transaction or internal financial information of Parent or
Nestle may be redacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall
be required to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate holding,
divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of, or any limitation
on, the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full
rights of ownership of (a "DIVESTITURE"), any asset or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates that individually
or in the aggregate would be material in relation to the continuing operations
of the combined U.S. pet food businesses of the Company and Parent and their
consolidated subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall offer to Divest,
if necessary, Meow Mix. Parent's actions with respect to the foregoing shall be
reasonable and reasonably calculated to facilitate consummation of the Merger by
the Outside Date.

               (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or
Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

               SECTION 6.04. STOCK OPTIONS; OTHER EQUITY INTERESTS. (a) As soon
as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to adjust the terms
of all outstanding Company Employee Stock Options, Company Phantom Shares and
Company SARs heretofore granted under any Company Stock Plan to provide that (i)
each Company Employee Stock Option (and any Company SAR related thereto)
outstanding at the Effective Time shall be canceled effective at the Effective
Time with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an amount of cash
equal to (x) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Employee Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which such Company Employee Stock Option shall not theretofore have
been exercised, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no cash payment shall be made with
respect to any Company SAR that was granted in tandem with a Company Employee
Stock Option in respect of which such a cash payment is made, (ii) each Company
SAR not granted in tandem with a related Company Employee Stock Option
outstanding at the Effective Time shall be canceled effective at the Effective
Time with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an amount of cash
equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) its Base
Value, and (iii) each Company Restricted Share and Company Phantom Share
outstanding at the Effective Time and any related account or account balance
shall be canceled effective at the Effective Time with the holder thereof
becoming entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to the sum of (x) the
Merger Consideration and (y) the amount of any unpaid accrued dividends relating
to such share and reflected in the account balance of such holder. Parent shall
promptly pay any such amounts after the Effective Time.

               (b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.

               (c) The Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective
Time, and the provisions in any other Company Benefit Plan providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest
in respect of any capital stock of the Company (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) shall be deleted as of the Effective Time, and the
Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company
Employee Stock Option or Company SAR or any participant in any Company Stock
Plan or other Company Benefit Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights)
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

               (d)  In this Agreement:

               "COMPANY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION" means any option to purchase
        Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan.

               "COMPANY SAR" means any stock appreciation right linked to the

6.04 and except for plans providing for the issuance of Company Capital Stock or
those portions of plans based on the value of Company Capital Stock, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for a period of one year after
the Effective Time the Company Benefit Plans in effect on the date of this
Agreement or to provide employee benefits to the participants in such plans that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to such employees than those provided to
such employees on the date of this Agreement.

               (b) For a period of one year after the Effective Time (or for the
length of time required by an applicable individual agreement in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, if different), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in
effect on the date of this
<PAGE>   49

Stock remaining in the Trust shall be equal to the Merger Consideration).

               (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to fund the Trust as necessary, and cause annual
valuations of the obligations covered thereby to occur, in order to comply with
the provisions of the Trust Agreement as in effect from time to time.

Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, to the
extent such plan is made available to an employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, for purposes only of determining eligibility to participate and
vesting, service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries with respect to such employee;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

               (f) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any
of its affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company and

after the Effective Time.

               (g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to prevent the termination of employment of any
individual employee of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary or any change in
the employee benefits available to any such individual employee or the amendment
or termination of any particular Company Benefit Plan or employment, severance
or termination agreement, plan or policy in accordance with applicable Law,
Contracts and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan or employment, severance or
termination agreement, plan or policy.

               SECTION 6.06. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Parent shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the
Company's obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds
for expenses) the current or former directors, executive officers or employees
of the Company for acts or omissions by such directors, executive officers or
employees occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such
obligations of the Company exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant
to the Company Charter (giving effect to the amendment disclosed in the
Company's 2000 Proxy Statement if such amendment is adopted), the Company
Bylaws, individual indemnity agreements, the MG&BCL or otherwise, and such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect

individual indemnity agreements and the MG&BCL from the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims
against such directors, executive officers or employees arising out of such acts
or omissions.

               (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers,
in each case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from
or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(such 200% amount, the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the
Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
<PAGE>   51
                                                                              47

shareholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly
known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal, (A) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to either Section 8.01(b)(i) without a vote at the Company
Shareholders Meeting having been taken or Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (B) within 18

except that 40% shall be substituted for 20% in each instance in such
definition. Any fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement (except
that in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii)(B) or (iii) above such

the date of execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation
of such transactions).

               (c) The Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub for their
out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum
of $10 million if: (i) Parent is entitled to receive a fee under Section 6.07(b)
or (ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c). Such
reimbursement shall be paid upon demand and presentation of documentation
evidencing such expenses following the payment of such fee or such termination.

breach by Parent of its obligations under Section 6.03) and (B) at the time of
any such termination any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b), 7.01(c)
or 7.02(c) have not been satisfied or waived due to a requirement by any
Governmental Entity located in the U.S. for Parent, the Company or their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates to make a Divestiture (other than any
Divestitures which include any cat food brand other than any cat food brand
Parent shall offer to Divest in accordance with Section 6.03(a)), then, unless
the Company shall have breached its obligations in any material respect under
Section 6.03 or shall have breached its representations and warranties hereunder
in a manner that would cause the condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) not to
be satisfied, Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $150 million; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, without limiting the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is
terminated as set forth above and any Governmental Entity located in the U.S. is
not willing to accept any Divestiture other than the entirety of the U.S. pet
food operations of Parent or the Company, no fee shall be payable by Parent
under this Section 6.07(e).

               SECTION 6.08.  PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Parent and Sub, on the one

each other the opportunity to review and make reasonable comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than statements made in
response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences, so long as any such statements are not
inconsistent with previous press releases of, or public statements made by, the
Company) and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law (including foreign regulations relating to competition), court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or other requirements of,
any securities exchange.

               SECTION 6.09. TRANSFER TAXES. All stock transfer, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("TRANSFER TAXES") incurred
in connection with the Merger shall be paid by either Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Sub and Parent in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

               SECTION 6.10. CONSEQUENCES IF COMPANY RIGHTS TRIGGERED. If any
Distribution Date or Shares Acquisition Date occurs under the Company Rights
Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time other than as a result of the actions of Parent or its
affiliates, the Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the Merger
Consideration as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve
the economic benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on
the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

               SECTION 6.11. SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

               SECTION 6.12.  CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES; OFFICES; NAMES.  (a)

two years after the Effective Time charitable contributions and activities that,

past practice as previously described to Parent, subject to the right of the
Surviving Corporation to make appropriate changes in the amounts of individual
charitable contributions or the nature of individual activities.

               (b) Parent intends, subject to the authority of the Surviving
Corporation's Board of Directors to manage the affairs of the Surviving

Surviving Corporation in the United States and Canada as a single business unit
and to establish the headquarters of such business unit in the St. Louis,

Patrick McGinnis shall be designated the president (and senior most executive
officer) of such combined business unit, reporting directly to the chief
executive officer of Nestle USA, Inc., and with responsibility for all North
American pet care operations, subject to reaching an agreement with Mr. McGinnis
to serve in such capacity on reasonably acceptable terms.

               (c) In connection with the public announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will publicly disclose the
matters set forth in this Section 6.12.

               SECTION 6.13. TAX MATTERS. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) deliver certificates or representation

Disclosure Letter and (ii) cause its respective special tax counsel to deliver
the opinion or opinions in the forms attached to Section 6.13 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, in each case dated as of the Closing Date.

rule, regulation or executive order prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this

any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The

Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                  SECTION 8.05. PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, EXTENSION
OR WAIVER. (a) A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an

Parent, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee of its Board of Directors.

Company has received a Superior Company Proposal, (ii) the Company has notified
Parent in writing of the determination described in clause (i) above, (iii) at
least five business days following receipt by Parent of the notice referred to

Board has again determined in good faith that such Superior Company Proposal
remains a Superior Company Proposal, (iv) the Company is in compliance with
Section 5.02, (v) the Company upon termination pays the amounts due under
Section 6.07(b), and (vi) Parent is not at such time entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) as a result of a wilful breach by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary or as a result of a non-wilful breach by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary the underlying facts of which have not been
disclosed to the party making such Superior Company Proposal to the extent such
facts have been disclosed to Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 8.05(b)
shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any required disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, such disclosure is necessary or advisable to comply with its
obligations under applicable Law.

Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they

Letter.

                  SECTION 9.05. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

                  SECTION 9.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall

                                                                              61

be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

                  SECTION 9.07. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES.
This Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, the Guarantee
and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the Merger and (b) except for the provisions of Article II and
Section 6.06, are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties
any rights or remedies.

                  SECTION 9.08. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Missouri,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof.

                  SECTION 9.09. ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without
the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations under
this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 9.10. ENFORCEMENT. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court
located in the State of New York, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Furthermore, each of Parent and the
Company hereby waives any requirement for security or the posting of any bond or
other security in connection with any temporary or permanent award of
injunctive, mandatory or other equitable relief granted in connection with this
Agreement. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit

New York in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any Federal court sitting
in the State of New York and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect
to any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
