corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
and Metrologic Instruments, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the " _Company_

conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each outstanding

Merger Consideration (as defined herein), as set forth herein, all upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

WHEREAS, a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Special Committee_ ") has (i) determined that the Merger on the terms and

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, C. Harry Knowles

collectively with Knowles, the " _Rollover Investors_ ") have entered into a
contribution and voting agreement with Parent (the " _EA Contribution
Agreements_ ", and together with the HK Contribution Agreement, the "
_Contribution Agreements_ "), which is in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
B_ , pursuant to which, among other things, EA has agreed to contribute
certain shares of Company Common Stock to Parent in exchange for shares of
capital stock of Parent and to vote the shares of Company Common Stock held by
EA in favor of approving this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

_ARTICLE I _

_THE MERGER_

1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall
prepare and cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of New Jersey a
certificate of merger to effect the Merger upon the terms hereof (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed by the
Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the NJBCA and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the NJBCA. The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of New Jersey or at such later time as is established by
the Company and Merger Sub and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a date to be specified by Parent and the
Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in 
_Article VII_ (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing
and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California
94304, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " shall be
any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking
institutions located in New York, New York or San Francisco, California are
permitted or required by law, executive order or governmental decree to remain
closed.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger; Structure_.

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, at which time the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the  



 

-2-  Company shall continue its existence as the surviving corporation. In its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, the Company is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." From and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
14A:10-6 of the NJBCA.

(b) At its election, Parent may change the structure or method of effecting
the combination with the Company, including to provide for a merger of the
Company into Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, provided, however, that no
such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to
be issued to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as provided for
in this Agreement or (ii) impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such structural change shall not affect
the accuracy (whether as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date) of the
Companys representations and warranties hereunder, which are made under the
assumption that the transaction is structured as a reverse triangular merger
as set forth in _Section 1.3(a),_ if such representations and warranties, but
for the structural change, would have been accurate as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Certificate of Merger shall provide
that, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended in its entirety as of the Effective Time to read as set forth in
_Exhibit C_ hereto (with such additional changes required to reflect the then
current directors of Surviving Corporation, in accordance with New Jersey
law), and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and as provided by applicable law.

1.5  _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by applicable law,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
bylaws.

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

-3- _ARTICLE II_

_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no payment
shall be made or consideration delivered in respect thereof.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be automatically converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
$18.50 in cash per share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each a
" _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
2.1(c)_ upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section
2.2_.

(d)  _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time in order to provide holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to each
such event.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging Certificates
for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this
_Article II_ and, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to
the Paying Agent sufficient funds for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates for the payment of the Merger Consideration to such
holders pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ upon surrender of such Certificates
(such funds, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any income from investment of  



 

-4-  the Exchange Fund, which shall be invested in accordance with the
instructions of Parent, will be payable solely to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)
a letter of transmittal, which shall be in customary form and specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including any non-profit
corporation), general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited
liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise,
association, organization, entity or Governmental Entity.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
Books_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, and from and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration, or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates on the date that is 180
days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
after the 180 days, any holder of a Certificate who has not previously
complied with this  _Section 2.2_ shall look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration without interest.



 

-5- (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any Person for any amount of Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options, as the case may be, such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other
applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such

actions with respect to all options to purchase Company Common Stock ("
_Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any stock option plans or other
equity-related plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company

regard to the vesting or exercise price of such Company Stock Options):

(i) With respect to Company Stock Options granted under the Companys 2004
Equity Incentive Plan (the " _2004 Plan Options_ "), the Company shall,
pursuant to the terms of such plan, automatically cancel all 2004 Plan Options
outstanding under such plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, without
regard to the exercise price of such 2004 Plan Options. For each cancelled
2004 Plan Option with an exercise price that is less than the Merger

Option to receive an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the product of
(i) the excess of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, without any
interest thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ "). For each cancelled 2004
Plan Option with an exercise price that is equal to or higher than the per
share Merger Consideration, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof as

immediately prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to which the holder
affirmatively would agree in writing to the cancellation of all (but not less
than all) of his or her 1994 Plan Options in consideration for the receipt of
the Option Consideration, if any. In the event one or more 1994 Plan Options
are not cancelled pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_, each such 1994 Plan
Option shall instead be adjusted pursuant to the terms and conditions of such
plan in a manner acceptable to Parent.

(iii) The Parties agree that the Company shall perform its obligations under
this _Section 2.3_ in compliance with applicable law, including the tender
offer rules under the Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws.
The terms and conditions of such a tender offer shall be subject to the
advance review and approval of the Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(b) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Company Stock Options a letter
describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and providing instructions for use in
obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options, if applicable.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions
(including without limitation, terminating or amending the terms of any
Company Stock Option or Company Stock Plan and preparing and providing the
applicable tender offer documents in compliance with applicable securities
laws), necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section
2.3_. 

(d) No later than the first Business Day following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take all action, including providing notice to plan
participants and adoption of any plan amendments, that may be necessary to
freeze participation in, and purchases under, all stock purchase plans of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to Company Common
Stock, including the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company
Purchase Plans_ "), so that no new offerings are made and no purchases occur
under the Company Purchase Plans after the execution of this Agreement. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions as may be necessary
to cause all participants rights under the Company Purchase Plans to
terminate on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, and on such date all accumulated payroll deductions allocated to each
participants account under the Company Purchase Plans shall thereupon be
returned to each participant as provided by the terms of the Company Purchase
Plans. As of the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall have terminated the Company Purchase Plans
and provided such notice of termination as may be required by the terms of the
Company Purchase Plans. The form and substance of any such notice regarding
the termination of the Company Purchase Plans shall be subject to the review
and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.



 

-7- 2.4 _Warrants_. Each warrant to acquire Company Common Stock (a " _Company
Warrant_ ") that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior the
Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger,
become exercisable for an amount of cash per share of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrant, without interest, equal to the
Merger Consideration.

of the Company as of December 31, 2005 included in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 is referred to herein

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains and
adheres to a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined

with GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys management or
other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or
the internal controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (C) any
claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

-38- 5.3 _Financing Commitments_.

(a) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to fully satisfy, on a
timely basis, all terms, conditions, representations and warranties set forth
in the Commitment Letters. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the financings contemplated
by the Commitment Letters on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent
in the aggregate than the Commitment Letters and on such other terms and
conditions as shall be satisfactory to Parent as soon as commercially
reasonable but in any event at or prior to the Closing. Parent will furnish
correct and complete copies of such definitive agreements to the Company
promptly following their execution.

(b) At the Companys request, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the
financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any

limited to, (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence
sessions, management presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) preparation of business projections and financial
statements (including pro forma financial statements) as are reasonably

Financing; provided that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in
relation to a debt securities offering shall be issued only by Parent or
Merger Sub, (iv) execution and delivery of any pledge documents, security
documents, credit agreements, guarantees or other financing documents,
including any certificates, legal surveys, title insurance or other documents
as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of the chief

however that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such document, agreement or certificate shall be effective until the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to the Effective Time, if necessary to facilitate
the Debt Financing), (v) obtaining customary comfort letters of accountants
and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating

by this Agreement, and (vi) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing. The  



 

-39-  Company shall also take such further action as may be required to cause an
independent auditor of the Company to provide any unqualified opinions,
consents or customary comfort letters with respect to the financial
statements. The Company shall allow Parents Representatives the opportunity
to review and comment upon the financial statements (including pro forma
financial statements) in draft form and to allow such representatives access
to the Company and supporting documentation with respect to the preparation of
such financial statements and the independent auditors work papers relating
to such financial statements.

5.4 _Investments_. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to Section 5.2(s),
the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
sell any investment securities as directed by Parent, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall purchase any investment securities or sell
any investment securities without the prior written consent of Parent,
other than purchases and sales of short-term government securities and
auction-rate securities in the ordinary course of business, consistent with
past practices.

_ARTICLE VI _

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors, officers or other employees, Affiliates, or any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative
retained by any of them (such directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, advisors and representatives,
collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal and shall request that all confidential information
previously furnished to such Persons with respect thereto to be returned or
destroyed.

(b) The Company shall not, and it shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and

of, any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person
(other than Parent or any designees of Parent) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its

take any other action knowingly intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries

or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
(vi) terminate, amend or waive any rights under any "standstill" or other  



 

-40-  similar agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person (other than Parent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to
obtaining the Required Company Shareholder Vote, (A) the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives have complied with this _Section 6.1_,
(B) a third party has proposed a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that
was not solicited, initiated, encouraged, induced, participated in or
otherwise facilitated by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their Representatives since May 31, 2006, and (C) the Company Board or the
Special Committee reasonably determines in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board or the Special Committee, as determined in good faith by a
majority of the members of the Company Board or the Special Committee, as the
case may be, after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and its
financial advisor, the Company may, subject to the Companys providing prior
written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action and compliance by
the Company with _Section 6.1(d)_, furnish information with respect to the
Company to, and participate in discussions and negotiations directly or
through its Representatives with, such third party, subject to a
confidentiality agreement not less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent for
informational purposes only). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.1_ by any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the
Company.

(c) Neither the Company Board, the Special Committee nor any other committee
thereof shall:

withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation;

(ii) approve or recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) approve or recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
") with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;

(iv) approve or recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, or execute or enter into, any agreement requiring it to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;

(v) take any action necessary to render the provisions of any anti-takeover
law inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal;



 

-41- (vi) approve or recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any position other than to recommend rejection (including
withdrawing, or modifying in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, any
recommendation of rejection) of any Acquisition Proposal; or

(vii) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing constituting or related to,
or that is intended to lead to, any Alternative Proposal. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, the Company Board or the Special
Committee may, prior to obtaining the Required Company Shareholder Vote only,
to the extent failure to do so would be a violation of the fiduciary
obligations of the Company Board under applicable law, as determined in good
faith by the Special Committee or the Company Board after consultation
with outside counsel, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Special Committee or the Company Board after the date of this Agreement,
withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the
Company Recommendation (a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ ") or take
such other actions specified in _Section 6.1(c)_ with respect to such Change
in Company Recommendation immediately prior to or concurrent with a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in compliance with _Section
8.1(h)_ if (and only if):

(A) such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of
this _Section 6.1_;

(B) the Company has complied with this  _Section 6.1_, including _Section
6.1(d)_;

(C) the Special Committee or the Company Board shall have first provided
prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Change in the
Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
attach the most current version of any written agreement relating to
the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal; and

(D) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after the receipt of
such notice, a proposal that the Special Committee or the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, is at
least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal. 

The Company agrees that, during the three Business Day period immediately
prior to effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation, the Company and
its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by Parent.

(d) _Notices to Parent_. The Company shall as promptly as possible (but in any
event within 24 hours) provide oral and written notice to Parent of receipt
by the Company or any of its Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any
inquiry with respect to or any request for nonpublic information in connection
with, any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and  



 

-42-  conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status
thereof and of any material modifications or developments with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, including, without limitation,
copies of all Acquisition Proposals, inquiries or requests and written
information relating thereto. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries
will not enter into a confidentiality agreement or any other agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the
Company from providing such information to Parent.

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to prohibit the Company from complying in good faith with respect to a tender
or exchange offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Special Committee nor Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender or exchange their shares
of Company Common Stock in connection with any such tender or exchange offer
(or otherwise approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, except, in each case, in accordance with  _Section 6.1(c)_.

(f) The consummation of the transaction contemplated by Section 5.1(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with _Section 5.1(e)(ii)_ hereof
shall not be subject to this _Section 6.1_.

(g) _Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement_ :

Company Board determines in its good faith reasonable judgment (after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors) to be (A) more favorable
to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the

to amend the terms of this Agreement), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and (B) reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed within a reasonable time period, in each
case taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects
of such proposal, and (ii) which either has no financing condition or has a

commitment letters no less favorable to the Company than the Commitment
Letters. 

6.2 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company, in cooperation with Parent, shall prepare and file

favor of the Company Voting Proposal (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The
Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders at the earliest
practicable time after the resolution of any such comments. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and shall supply Parent with copies

Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this
_Section 6.2_ to comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to shareholders of the Company, such
amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not

access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner
that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, to
all of its properties (including the Real Property for the purpose of
performing such environmental tests and investigations as Parent may desire),
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent shall
request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) (a) furnish promptly to Parent and its potential
financing sources and their respective Representatives (x) a copy of each

properties, assets and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (b) will
instruct the Companys employees and Representatives to cooperate with Parent
in its

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

Company reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
violate any applicable law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject (it being agreed that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that
does not cause such violation or jeopardization). Parent will hold any such
information that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation conducted or information obtained
by Parent, pursuant to this Section 6.4 or otherwise, will be deemed
to supplement, waive or otherwise modify any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth herein.

6.5 _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company Charter
Documents and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly call,

Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting
Proposal. Subject to _Section 6.1_, (i) the Special Committee and the Company
Board shall recommend approval of the Company Voting Proposal by the
shareholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (ii) the Special Committee and the Company Board shall not
withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the recommendation of the Special Committee or the Company Board that
the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal.
The Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to
solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal
and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company required by the rules
of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the NJBCA to obtain such approvals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company, with the prior approval of Parent, may adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys shareholders
or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting.

will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in
advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Law.



 

-46- (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to take any action
under this Section if the United States Department of Justice or the United
States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary
injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger.

(d) Subject to _Section 6.6(c)_, each of Parent and the Company agree to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking
damages or other relief as a result of, the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby entered by any court or other Governmental Entity promptly
vacated or reversed.

6.7 _Public Disclosure_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
(including scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts) with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statement as may be required by applicable law, including federal
securities laws, or the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market or any
listing agreement if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been
unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public statement is so
required to be issued, filed or made.

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers
and directors of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
permitted by the NJBCA or any other applicable law or provided under the
Company Charter Documents in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under applicable law.

(b) Parent or Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations to which such Indemnified
Person is entitled under this _Section 6.8_. Parent or Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit, investigation or
proceeding and Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Person for any legal expenses of separate counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent or Surviving Corporation elects not
to assume such defense or in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Person, after consultation with counsel, the Indemnified Person determines
that a conflict of interest exists between Parent or Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person may assume the defense of
such action and retain counsel of his or her choice, subject to the consent  



 

-47-  of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Parent or
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Person promptly as statements therefor are
received; provided that Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
for the fees of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons, other than
local counsel, and provided further that Parent and Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in
effect for six years after the Effective Time insurance "tail" or other
insurance policies with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance with respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
coverage applicable to directors and officers as of the Effective Time under
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy; provided,
however, that if such "tail" or other policies are not available at an annual
cost not greater than 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
hereof under such policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ ") (which premium the Company
hereby represents and warrants is as set forth on _Section 6.8(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter), then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
obtained as much comparable insurance as can reasonably be obtained in its
good faith judgment at a cost up to but not exceeding the Insurance Cap.

(d) This _Section 6.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
Indemnified Person, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by each
Indemnified Person. If Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all,
substantially all or a substantial part of its business and/or assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, the Parent shall require and cause any
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee to expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_. The provisions of
this _Section 6.8_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs, and his or her
representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Person may
have by contract, law, the Company Charter Documents, the Subsidiary Charter
Documents or otherwise.

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other, shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after
becoming aware of any such breach) notify the other party in writing if it
believes that such party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement that could, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 7.3_ if continuing on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the above,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the
Merger.



  

-48- (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any written notice from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any
notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter in response to the representations and warranties of the
Company under Article III or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all such reasonable steps as may be required to cause to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) under such rule and result from the transactions
contemplated by _Article I_ and _Article II_ of this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

6.11 _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory
to Parent of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of all
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (except those designated by
Parent to the Company in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing).

6.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor and provide for payment of all accrued obligations and
benefits under all Company Plans set forth, and identified as such, in the
Company Disclosure Letter (including, without limitation, employment or
severance agreements between the Company and Company Employees), all in
accordance with their respective terms.

(b) Employees of the Company as of the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
shall receive credit for past service with the Company for purposes of
accrual of vacation time and, to extent practicable and permitted under
applicable benefit plans, for purposes of eligibility for participation and
vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under which Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will have sole discretion over
the hiring, promotion, retention, firing and other terms and conditions of the
employment of the Continuing Employees.  



 

-49-  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any Company Plan in accordance with its terms.

wire transfer of same-day funds within one Business Day following termination

condition set forth in _Section 7.2(f)_), provided that no such fee shall be
payable in the event the failure of the condition set forth in  _Section
7.2(f)_ to be satisfied is a result of a Market MAC or a material adverse
development with respect to the ITC case. For purposes hereof, " _Market MAC_
" shall mean (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on
prices for, securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market for three or more
consecutive Business Days; (ii) the declaration of a banking moratorium or any
suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States generally for
three or more consecutive Business Days; (iii) any material disruption in the

governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or authority which prohibits

financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters for a period of three or
more consecutive Business Days.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Payment of the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee,
as the case may be, shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a
breach of this Agreement described in clause (a) of the proviso in _Section
8.2_ but is otherwise the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in
connection with any termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in
_Section 8.3(b)_.

(e) The Company shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by Parent in connection with its enforcement of the

right to receive any amounts from the Company under this  _Section 8.3_.

(f) For purposes of this _Section 8.3_ only, " _Company Acquisition_ " shall

substantial assets, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or other business
combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the
issuance by the Company of  



 

-55-  50% or more of its voting securities or (iii) the acquisition by any person
or group of 50% or more of the capital stock or assets of the Company or

Acquisition.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or
waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub may assign their rights
and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto; _provided further_ that no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity, legality or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not  



 

-58-  sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by
any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by
sending or delivering a  



 

-59-  copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 9.2_. Nothing in this 
_Section 9.11_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law.

9.12  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
