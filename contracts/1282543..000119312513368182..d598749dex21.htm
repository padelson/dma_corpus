dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, are or
are not required to be disclosed, and neither Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute or controversy with any Party as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in a Schedule hereto is or is not required to be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material). The disclosure of any information concerning
a matter in the Disclosure Schedule does not imply that any other undisclosed matter that has a greater significance or value is material. The disclosure of an item in one section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed a disclosure of such
item in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule unless referred to specifically in such other section or such cross reference can be reasonably inferred when taking into consideration the item being disclosed. The Disclosure Schedule will be
arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered sections of this Agreement. The information contained in the Schedules hereto is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained therein shall be deemed to be an
admission by any Party to any Third Party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any agreement. The representations and warranties of one Party shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the other Party (or by any of its advisors, consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that such other Party or any of its advisors, consultants or representatives knew or should have known that any such
