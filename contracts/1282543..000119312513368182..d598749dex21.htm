the Closing Date until such earlier time as such approval, authorization,

corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of any such benefit to the extent
the Parties would have been responsible hereunder if such Pre-Closing

a waiver by Buyer of its rights to have received as of the Closing Date an
effective assignment of all of the Purchased Assets, nor shall this _Section
1.02(d)_ be deemed to constitute an agreement to exclude from the
Purchased Assets any properties, assets or rights described in _Section

of the Buyer PartiesÂ’ pre-closing condition set forth in _Section 7.10_.

any objections to the Closing Statement, then Holdings shall deliver to Buyer
a statement (an " _Objection Statement_ ") setting forth its disputes or
objections (the " _Objection Disputes_ ") to the Closing Statement and, to the
extent practical, HoldingsÂ’ proposed resolution of each such Objection
Dispute. If an Objection Statement is not delivered to Buyer within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, then the Closing Statement
as originally delivered by Buyer shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the Parties. If an Objection Statement is timely delivered, then Buyer and

delivery of the Objection

 



\- 10 -  Statement, Holdings and Buyer shall submit each unresolved Objection Dispute
to a nationally recognized, impartial, independent auditor to be agreed upon
by the Parties (the " _Independent Auditor_ ") to resolve such Objection
Disputes. The Independent Auditor shall be instructed to set forth a procedure
to provide for prompt resolution of any unresolved Objection Disputes and, in
any event, to make its determination in respect of such Objection Disputes
within thirty (30) days following its retention. The Independent AuditorÂ’s
determination of such Objection Disputes shall be final and binding upon the
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such determination with respect to
any item reflected in the Objection Statement shall be any more favorable to
Buyer than is set forth in the Closing Statement or any more favorable to
Holdings than is proposed in the Objection Statement. If any unresolved
Objection Disputes are submitted to the Independent Auditor, then, for
purposes of this _Section 1.07(a)_, Buyer shall be the prevailing party in
such proceeding if a majority of the dollar amount of the unresolved
Objection Disputes are decided by the Independent Auditor in favor of Buyer,
and Holdings shall be the prevailing party if a majority of the dollar amount
of the unresolved Objection Disputes are decided by the Independent Auditor in
favor of Holdings (e.g., if there are $200,000 of disputed items to be
determined by the Independent Auditor and the Independent Auditor determines
that BuyerÂ’s claims prevail with respect to $125,000 and HoldingsÂ’ claims
prevail with respect to $75,000, then Buyer would be the prevailing party).
The party that is not the prevailing party shall pay all of the fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Auditor. The final Closing Statement, however
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.07(a)_, will produce the Working
Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any, and the Cash Amount, in
each case to be used to determine the final Cash Payment. The process set
forth in this _Section 1.07(a)_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties
for any disputes related to items required to be reflected on the Closing
Statement or included in the calculation of the Working Capital, the Cash
Amount, whether or not the underlying facts and circumstances constitute a
breach of any representations or warranties.

(b) _Applicable Accounting Principles_. The Closing Statement (and all
calculations of Working Capital and the Cash Amount) shall be prepared and
calculated (i) in accordance with GAAP, except that the Closing Statement (and
all calculations of Working Capital and the Cash Amount) shall not include any
purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except with respect to the
implementation of the Pre-Closing Transactions) and (ii) consistent with the
calculation of Working Capital as of June 30, 2013 attached as _Schedule
10(WC)_.

(c) _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, each of the Parties shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates and their respective officers, employees,
consultants, accountants and agents to (i) reasonably cooperate with the other
and their respective accountants in connection with the review of the Closing
Statement and the preparation of the Objection Statement and (ii) provide any
books, records and other information reasonably requested by the other and
their respective accountants in connection therewith or in connection with
resolving any Objection Dispute.

\- 11 - (ii) In the event that (A) the RBC Ratio as of June 30, 2014, determined in

the June 30, 2014 Payment Amount is needed to bring the RBC Ratio to 375% as

less the sum of all Make-Whole Payments previously made, shall be paid to
Holdings (the " _Applicable Payment Amount_ ").

 

(iv) In the event that (A) the RBC Ratio as of any RBC Measurement Date
commencing September 30, 2014 (or, at the election of Holdings exercised by
written notice to Buyer, such earlier RBC Measurement Date immediately
preceding or following the date on which a Change of Control occurs) and
ending December 31, 2015, determined in accordance with  _Section 1.08(d)_,
is less than 350% (375% in the case of June 30, 2014), (B) an amount less than
the Applicable Payment Amount is needed to bring the RBC Ratio to 350% as of
such RBC Measurement Date (375% in the case of June 30, 2014) and (C) through
such RBC Measurement Date, none of the Capacity and Distribution Conditions
has been violated, then at the option of Holdings exercised by written notice
delivered to Buyer within sixty (60) days following the later of the date on
which the Change of Control occurred or such RBC Measurement Date, (x) the
amount needed to bring the RBC Ratio to 350% as of such Measurement Date (375%
in the case of June 30, 2014) shall be paid to Affirmative Insurance Company
(the " _Applicable RBC Amount_ ") and (y) the remainder, if any, of the
Applicable Payment Amount less the Applicable RBC Amount shall be paid to
Holdings.

 

(v) In the event that the Capacity and Distribution conditions have been
satisfied with respect to each applicable RBC Measurement Date through and
including September 30, 2015, then the Capacity and Distribution Conditions
shall be deemed satisfied at all times thereafter for purposes of this
_Section 1.08_.

Distribution Agreement with respect to its activities in Louisiana and Alabama
(such obligations to survive the termination of the Distribution Agreement by
Buyer pursuant to  _Section 5.2.2_, _5.2.5_ or _5.2.6_ thereof, solely for
purposes of determining compliance with the Capacity and Distribution
Conditions hereunder).

 

" _RBC Measurement Date_ " means any of the calendar quarter end dates
commencing September 30, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015.

(b) _Failure to Meet Conditions_. For the sake of clarity, if none of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 1.08(a)_ are satisfied, then there shall
be no obligation to pay Holdings any portion of the Contingent Amount.

(c)  _Timing and method of Payment_. So long as the Capacity and Distribution
Conditions have been satisfied as of a particular RBC Measurement Date (and
whether or not the Capacity and Distribution Conditions have been satisfied as
of December 31, 2015), the Contingent Amount (or portion thereof, if any, as
determined in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in _Section
1.08(a)_) shall be paid within twenty (20) days following the delivery
by Holdings to Buyer of a Contingent Amount Request and the satisfaction of
the other terms and conditions provided for in _Section 1.08(d)_. The payment
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Holdings. If Buyer claims that the Capacity and
Distribution Conditions have not been satisfied as of a particular RBC
Measurement Date, Buyer shall deliver to Holdings a notice setting forth in
reasonable detail its claims as to which Capacity and Distribution Conditions
have not been satisfied as of such date. If such notice is not delivered to
Holdings within ten (10) business days after delivery of the Contingent Amount
Request, the Capacity and Distribution Conditions shall be deemed to have

Capacity and Distribution Conditions have been satisfied. The Insurance
Expert shall be instructed to provide its determination as to whether such
Capacity and Distribution Conditions had been satisfied to the Parties within
thirty (30) days following its retention. The Insurance
ExpertÂ’s determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If the
Insurance Expert determines that the Capacity and Distribution Conditions have
been satisfied, then Buyer shall pay all of the fees, costs and expenses of
the Insurance Expert. If the Insurance Expert determines that the Capacity
and Distribution Conditions have not been satisfied, then Holdings shall pay
all of the fees, costs and expenses of the Insurance Expert. The process set
forth in this _Section 1.08(c)_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties
for any disputes related to the determination of whether the Capacity and

any liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA).

leave as of the Closing Date and present themselves for work to the Buyer
Parties (or Affiliate) within three (3) months of the Closing Date shall be

Closing Date, except to the extent reflected as a liability in the calculation
of Working Capital, and Buyer shall, if applicable and subject to the
Transition Services Agreement, be responsible for claims for medical,
prescription, dental and vision benefits incurred on or after the Closing
Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a claim shall be deemed to have

rendered and not the date of inception of the related illness or injury or the
date of submission of a claim related thereto.

 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Continuing Employees who are
participants in the Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc. 401(k) Plan ("
_Sellers Â’ 401(k) Plan_") shall cease to be eligible for any future
contributions to SellersÂ’ 401(k) plan, and shall have a fully vested and

Employees who are participants in the SellersÂ’ 401(k) Plan shall be entitled
to a distribution of their account balances under SellersÂ’ 401(k) Plan in
accordance with such plan and as permitted by the Code. After the Expiration
of the Benefit Plan Transition Period, Continuing Employees who receive an

favorable determination letter (or prototype sponsor IRS opinion letter) with

time prior to the Closing Date. Buyer Parties shall be responsible for and
shall jointly and severally indemnify Seller Indemnitees and hold
them harmless from and against, any Losses attributable to payments or claims
relating to vacation, sick and other paid time off accrued by Continuing
Employees as of the Closing Date.

 

(g) Except as provided in this _Section 5.13_, Sellers shall be responsible

Employee or Non-Retail Employee or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof, or any other Person, or any rights or remedies of any nature or kind

ARTICLE VI

 

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

 

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing:

 

6.01 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) _General_. From and after the Closing, upon the reasonable request of the
other Party and at the requesting PartyÂ’s expense (unless the requesting
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article_ IX), each Party
will execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged
and delivered, all such further documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further actions as the requesting Party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
Transactions.

 

(b) _Retail Business Assets_. In order to effectuate the intent of the Parties
hereunder that the Buyer purchase the SellersÂ’ Retail Business, if Buyer
shall deliver a written notice to Holdings on or prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date claiming that an asset (other than cash, cash
equivalents or any asset listed on any Schedule included in  _Section
1.02(b)_) owned or leased by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Acquired Retail Group Members and other than a Subsidiary that is a
regulated insurance company) was either (x) located at or attributable to
a Retail Facility, (y) exclusively used to engage in the Retail Business or
(z) primarily used to engage in the Retail Business and not material to the
conduct of

 



\- 45 -  the other businesses of Holdings and its Subsidiaries or materially used in
such businesses, but such asset was not transferred hereunder (either directly
as a Purchased Asset or indirectly through the transfer of the Retail Entity
Equity Interests), then the Buyer and Holdings shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any dispute as to whether such asset should be transferred to
Buyer. If Buyer and Holdings do not reach a final resolution within twenty
(20) days after the delivery of such notice, Holdings and Buyer shall submit
their dispute to an Insurance Expert to determine whether or not such asset
should be transferred to Buyer. The Insurance Expert shall be instructed to
provide its determination as to whether such asset should be transferred to
Buyer within thirty (30) days following its retention. The Insurance ExpertÂ’s
determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Holdings and Buyer
shall share equally the fees, costs and expenses of the Insurance Expert.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to pay
any additional consideration for any transfer of an asset to it required under
this  _Section 6.01(b)_ other than with respect to any asset that
constitutes a current asset that would have properly been included in the
calculation of Working Capital had such asset been transferred on the date
hereof. The Buyer Parties shall pay to Holdings (or its designee) the
aggregate book value in excess of $50,000 of any such current assets as a
condition precedent to the requirement that Holdings (or its applicable
Subsidiary) transfer such current assets pursuant to this  _Section
6.01(b)_.

6.02 _Director and Officer Indemnification; Other Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, (i) Buyer Parties shall
not, and shall not permit the Retail Group Members (other than USAgencies)
to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in their Organizational Documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any officers, directors or managers (unless required
by Law), and (ii) USAgencies shall not, and Holdings shall not permit
USAgencies to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in its Organizational
Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement relating to the exculpation
or indemnification of any officers, directors or managers (unless required by
Law); it being the intent of the Parties that the officers, directors and
managers of each Retail Group Member shall continue to be entitled, during
such period, to exculpation and indemnification arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring prior to Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent of the Law provided
under such Retail Group MemberÂ’s Organizational Documents in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, at their sole cost and
expense, the Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause the Retail Group Members
(other than USAgencies) to, either maintain director and officer liability
insurance or acquire a director and officer liability run-off policy or
extended reporting coverage (i.e., "tail coverage"), which in either case
shall provide coverage for the individuals who were officers, directors or
managers of such Retail Group Members prior to Closing comparable to the
coverage provided as of the date hereof under the policy or policies
maintained by or for the Retail Group Members for the benefit of such
individuals in each case provided such coverage is reasonably available.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, at its sole cost and
expense USAgencies shall, and Holdings shall cause USAgencies to, either
maintain insurance comparable to, or acquire a run-off policy or extended
reporting coverage (i.e., "tail coverage")

 



\- 46 -  for, each "claims made" insurance policy that is maintained by or for
USAgencies as of the date hereof, including, without limitation, director and
officer liability insurance, errors and omission insurance, employment
practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, which in each
such case shall provide coverage for matters pertaining to any facts,
circumstances, situations, acts, errors or omissions existing or occurring
prior to the Closing Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing in each case provided such coverage is reasonably available.

 

(d) The Sellers agree to make available to the Buyer and the Acquired Retail
Group Members any existing occurrence-based insurance coverage held by the
Sellers or their Subsidiaries on which the Acquired Retail Group Members are
insured relating to occurrences prior to the Closing (the " _Sellers Policies_
"). In the event of an occurrence which may be covered by one or more Seller
Policies, the Acquired Retail Group Members may, after consultation with the
Sellers, submit a claim for such occurrence to the appropriate insurer under
the applicable Seller Policy. The Sellers agree to provide reasonable
assistance in order to pursue such claim with the insurer, including, as
necessary, acting as the direct contact with such insurer and pursuing such
claim on behalf of the Acquired Retail Group Members. The Sellers will request
the written consent of SellersÂ’ insurance company(ies) permitting the Buyer
and the Acquired Retail Group Members to seek recovery under the Sellers
Policies after the Closing, for pre-Closing Losses.

 

6.03 _Litigation Support; Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, in
the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or defending
against any Litigation brought by a Third Party in connection with (a) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing

Parties will reasonably cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and
its counsel in the contest or defense, reasonably make available his or its
personnel, and provide such access to its books and records, as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the
sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
_Article IX_ hereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the requested Party
may refuse the requesting Party access if the requested Party reasonably
determines that such access would unreasonably interfere with the ordinary
course operation of its or its SubsidiariesÂ’ business, (b) the requesting
Party shall be jointly and severally responsible for any damage to any of the
assets or properties of the requested Party or its Subsidiaries caused by the
requesting Party or its representatives; and (c) the requested Party shall not
be required to (or cause any Subsidiary to) afford such access to the extent
that doing so would result in the breach of any confidentiality or similar
agreement to which the requested Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or the
loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the requested Party shall
use reasonable efforts to allow for such access in a manner that does not
result in a breach of such agreement or a loss of attorney-client privilege).
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Sellers, for a period of
seven (7) years following the Closing Date, Buyer Parties shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Retail Group Members to, refrain from destroying, altering
or otherwise disposing of any of its books and records, or any portions
thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior written notice to the Sellers and offering to surrender to
the Seller such books and records or such portions thereof.

 



\- 47 - 6.04 _Transfer Taxes_. Each Party shall be liable for, hold the other Parties
and their Affiliates harmless against, and agree to pay fifty percent (50%)
of any and all sales, use, registration, value added, transfer, stamp, stock
transfer, real property transfer and similar Taxes that may be imposed,
incurred, payable or collectible in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer Parties and Sellers agree to
cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates
necessary to enable the other Parties to comply with any filing requirements
for such Transfer Taxes.

6.05 _Investment Intent of Buyer_. Buyer will refrain from transferring or
otherwise disposing of any of the Retail Entity Equity Interests acquired by
it, or any interest therein, in such manner as to violate the Securities Act
or any applicable state or foreign securities Law regulating the
disposition thereof. Buyer agrees that the certificates representing the
Retail Entity Equity Interests may bear legends to the effect that the Retail
Entity Equity Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act or
such other state or foreign securities Laws, and that no interest therein may
be transferred or otherwise disposed of in violation of the provisions
thereof.

6.06  _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Income Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Sellers shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to prepare, or
cause to be prepared: (A) all Income Tax Returns for the Retail Group Members
(or which otherwise reflect their assets and operations) for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (B) all Income Tax Returns
filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis for which any of the
Retail Group Members joins with Holdings or any of its Affiliates. Such Income
Tax Returns shall be prepared on a consistent basis with SellersÂ’ prior Income
Tax Returns. The Buyer Parties shall cooperate, as necessary, in the signing
and timely filing of any such Income Tax Returns required to be filed after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that (A) Sellers shall provide the Buyer
Parties with any draft Income Tax Return required to be executed by a Buyer or
any Person under the control of such Buyer at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for filing such Income Tax Return, (B) at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Income Tax Returns, the
Buyer Parties shall notify the Sellers of the existence of any objection they
may have to any items set forth on such draft Income Tax Return, and (C) if,
after consulting in good faith, the Buyer Parties and the Sellers are unable
to resolve such objection(s), such objection(s) shall be referred to an
independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer Parties and the
Sellers for resolution in accordance with applicable Law. Copies of any Income
Tax Returns prepared by, or caused to be prepared by the Sellers and
described in clause (A) of this _Section 6.06(a)(i)_ shall be furnished to
Buyer promptly upon filing.

 

(ii) Except as provided in _Section 6.06(a)(i)_ above, the Buyer Parties
shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Income Tax Returns of the
Acquired Retail Group Members; provided, however, that (A) the Buyer Parties
shall provide the Sellers with draft Income Tax Returns for the Acquired
Retail Group Members required to be

 



\- 48 -  prepared by the Buyer Parties pursuant to this _Section 6.06(a)(ii)_ for an
Overlap Period at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Income Tax Return, (B) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for
the filing of such Income Tax Returns, the Sellers shall notify the Buyer

good faith, the Buyer Parties and the Sellers are unable to resolve such
objection(s), such objection(s) shall be referred to an independent accounting
firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer Parties and the Sellers for resolution
in accordance with applicable Law on a consistent basis with SellersÂ’ prior
Income Tax Returns.

(b)  _Indemnification for Taxes_.

(i) Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Buyer Parties and the
Acquired Retail Group Members and hold them harmless from _(a)_ all Taxes of
the Retail Group Members for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the
Overlap Period through the end of the Closing Date and _(b)_ any Taxes of
any combined, consolidated or similar group of which any Retail Group Member
has been a member at any time prior to the Closing Date or for which any
Retail Group Member is otherwise liable as of the Closing; provided, however,
that, in respect of Taxes of the Acquired Retail Group Members for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, the Sellers shall be liable only to the extent such Taxes
have not been paid or deposited by the Closing Date or provided for in a
reserve on the Closing Statement or included in Seller Transaction Expenses;
provided, further, that the Sellers shall not be liable for, and the Buyer
Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Sellers for, any Taxes
attributable to actions taken by the Acquired Retail Group Members after the
Closing that are outside the Ordinary Course of Business and not contemplated
by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Taxes for which the Buyer
Parties and the Retail Group Members are indemnified under this  _Section
6.06(b)(i)_ include, without limitation, any Taxes attributable to the
distribution or other transfer of Excluded Assets or any other assets by
Retail Group Members on or before the Closing Date that are not owned by the
Acquired Retail Group Members upon the completion of the Closing. If Income
Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to _Section
6.06(b)(ii)_ below are less than the sum of any estimated Income Tax payments
or deposits made by the Retail Group Members and any reserve for Taxes
provided for on the Closing Statement, the Buyer Parties shall remit the
difference to the Sellers by no later than two business days before the due
date of such Income Taxes.

 

(ii) In the case of any Overlap Period, Taxes with respect to the Retail Group

Date shall be determined from the books and records of the Retail Group
Members as though the taxable year of the Retail Group Members terminated at
the close of business on the Closing Date, except that any Taxes imposed on
real or personal property shall be allocated on the basis of chronological
proration. The Buyer Parties and the Sellers shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, elect with the relevant Taxing Authority to treat for all

the Acquired Retail Group Members.

 



\- 49 - (c) _Tax Controversies_.

 

(i) The Buyer Parties shall promptly notify the Sellers upon receipt by a
Buyer Parties or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Retail Group
Members after the Closing Date) of written notice of any Tax Matter (provided,
that the failure to provide prompt notice shall not affect SellersÂ’
obligations hereunder except and solely to the extent of any actual prejudice
to Sellers resulting from such delay). Subject to the provisions of this
_Section 6.06(c)(i)_ and to _Section 6.06(c)(ii)_, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers shall have the authority (and
the Buyer Parties shall cause the Acquired Retail Group Members to provide
the SellersÂ’ tax advisors with the appropriate powers of attorney) to
represent the interests of each of the Acquired Retail Group Members with
respect to any Tax Matter for any Pre-Closing Tax Period other than an
Overlap Period before the IRS, any other Taxing Authority, any other
Governmental Authority or any court and shall have the sole right to control
the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Matter, including
responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against
and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, a Tax Matter. The Sellers
shall keep the Buyer Parties fully and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter described above. The Sellers
shall, in good faith, allow the Buyer Parties to make comments to the Sellers
or the SellersÂ’ tax advisors regarding the conduct of or positions taken in
any such proceeding relating to a Tax Matter for any period other than an
Overlap Period and if such Tax Matter relates to a Tax Return other than a
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return, the Sellers shall afford the
Buyer Parties and its counsel the right, at the Buyer PartiesÂ’ own expense, to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Income
Tax Matter. The Sellers shall not settle any Tax Matter without the prior
written consent of the Buyer Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) if such settlement would materially increase the past,
present or future Tax liability of the Buyer Parties or any of
their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Retail Group Members) or any Tax
liability of the Acquired Retail Group Members for any taxable period or
portion thereof ending after the Closing Date. If the Sellers do not promptly
assume and pursue diligently the defense of any Tax Matter described herein,
the Buyer Parties may defend such Tax Matter in such manner as it deems
appropriate, including but not limited to settling such Tax Matter, without in
any way limiting the Buyer PartiesÂ’ rights to indemnification hereunder.

(ii) The Buyer Parties shall have the sole right to control any audit or
examination by any Taxing Authority, and contest, resolve and defend against
any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, the income, assets or operations of
the Acquired Retail Group Members for any Overlap Period and for all taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date. With respect to any matter described in
the preceding sentence relating to an Overlap Period, the Buyer Parties shall
(i) keep the Sellers fully and timely informed with respect to such
proceedings (by provision of information to the Sellers), (ii) in good faith,
allow the Seller to make comments to the Buyer Parties regarding the conduct
of or positions taken in any such proceeding and (iii) not enter into any
settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of the Sellers,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.

 



\- 50 - (d) _Refunds and Overpayments of Taxes_. Any refunds of Taxes of the Acquired
Retail Group Members that are received by the Buyer Parties and any
overpayments of Tax of the Acquired Retail Group Members credited against Tax
which the Buyer Parties would be or would have been required to pay that, in
each case, relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion of an
Overlap Period ending with the Closing Date shall be for the account of the
Sellers, and the Buyer Parties shall pay over to the Sellers any such refund
or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto. No payment shall be required under the preceding
sentence, however, to the extent the refund or overpayment of Taxes with
respect to which a payment by the Buyer Parties would otherwise be required
is reflected as an asset of the Retail Group Members on the Closing Statement.

(e) _Prior Tax Agreements_. The Sellers shall terminate or cause to be
terminated any and all of the Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or
similar agreements, arrangements or undertakings in effect, written or
unwritten, on the Closing Date as between the Seller (or any of
its Affiliates, other than the Acquired Retail Group Members), on the one
hand, and the Acquired Retail Group Members, on the other hand, for all Taxes
imposed by any Taxing Authority, regardless of the period in which such Taxes
are imposed, and there shall be no continuing obligation to make any payments
under any such agreements, arrangements or undertakings.

(f)  _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(i) The Buyer and Holdings jointly shall make timely and irrevocable
elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to BuyerÂ’s
acquisition of the capital stock of the Retail Entities pursuant to this

Group Members.

 

(ii) The Section 338 Elections shall be effected as follows:

 

(A) As soon as practicable, Buyer shall prepare Internal Revenue Service Form
8023 and any similar forms necessary to effectuate the Section 338 Elections

Election Forms_ "). Holdings shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of
the Section 338 Election Forms and shall deliver duly completed, executed
copies thereof in a manner that permits the timely filing thereof.

(B) Buyer Parties and Sellers agree that the Cash Payment, as adjusted
pursuant to _Article I_ , and increased by the Assumed Liabilities, shall be
allocated among the stock of the Acquired Retail Group Members (and among the
assets of the Acquired Retail Group Members to the extent Section 338
Elections are made for such Acquired Retail Group Members) and the Purchased
Assets in accordance with _Exhibit C_ (the " _Allocation_ ").

 

(C) The Buyer Parties and the Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including
but not limited to the Section 338 Election Forms) consistent with the
Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller nor any Affiliate of either shall
take any position contrary to those set forth in the Section 338 Election
Forms.

 



\- 51 - (g) The Buyer Parties shall afford the Sellers, upon reasonable notice and
without undue interruption to the business of the Buyer Parties or the
Acquired Retail Group Members, access during normal business hours to the
books, records and appropriate employees of the Acquired Retail Group Members
relating to the Acquired Retail Group Members prior to the Closing Date for a
period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date in connection with (i)

records of the Acquired Retail Group Members for the period and otherwise
subject to the terms of this _Section 6.06_.

 

6.07 _Restrictive Covenants_. Sellers acknowledge and agree that substantial
and valuable assets which belong to the Acquired Retail Group Members or
which are being transferred hereunder as part of the Purchased Assets include
trade names, Confidential Information, Accounts, Retail Business relationships
with Clients and Active Prospective Clients, and associated goodwill of
the Retail Group Members, and that the relationships which Buyer Parties and
the Acquired Retail Group Members have with their employees and independent
producers (including, without limitation, the Retail Employees) are
significant business relationships necessary for such companies to operate
the business being acquired hereunder, and that Buyer Parties and the Acquired
Retail Group Members, following this transaction, shall be engaged in the
Retail Business throughout the Restricted Territory and elsewhere in the

severally obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against all
indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Deductible.

(c) With respect to breaches by the Sellers of their Non-Fundamental
Representations, the aggregate maximum amount of Losses recoverable by the

covenants in this Agreement), after Closing.

 

9.03 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller Indemnitees_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_ , the Buyer
Parties will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Seller

Deductible.

 

9.04 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(a) If any Third Party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under this _Article IX_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly
(and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after receiving notice of the
Third Party Claim) notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing,
describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the
basis of the claim; provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure shall
have caused the damages for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be
greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnified Party given the
Indemnifying Party prompt notice hereunder.

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of his, her, or its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in

 



\- 62 -  writing within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given
notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party is assuming such
defense and that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against the entirety of any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages
and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iii) settlement
of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in
the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a
precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business
interests or the reputation of the Indemnified Party, and (iv) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently.

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with  _Section 9.04(b)_, (i) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at his, her, or its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld), (C) the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld),
and (D) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in the review, investigation and defense of any such claim, shall
make its personnel reasonably available, and shall provide such testimony and
access to its books and records as is reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith.

(d) In the event any of the conditions in _Section 9.04(b)_ is or
becomes unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against,
and consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner he, she or it may reasonably
deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain
any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), and (ii)
the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible for any Losses the
Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in
the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent
provided in this _Article IX_.

 

9.05 _Determination of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_
shall be reduced for any net insurance proceeds (after reduction for the out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such recovery) and
Tax Benefits actually received by the Indemnified Party on account of such
Loss. In the event that an insurance recovery or a Tax Benefit is
actually received by an Indemnified Party, in each case with respect to any
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the amount of such recovery or Tax Benefit shall be made promptly to
the Indemnifying Party that made or directed such indemnification payments to
such Indemnified Party.

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as
they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



\- 63 - (c) For purpose of determining the amount of any Loss resulting from or
arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
made by the Buyer Parties in _Article III_ or the Sellers in _Article IV_ (but
not for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or
inaccuracy), each representation or warranty shall be read without giving
effect to any qualification based on materiality or Material Adverse Effect
(fully as if any such word or phrase were deleted from such representation or
warranty).

 

9.06 _Mitigation_. Except with respect to breaches of _Section 4.31_ (Fair
Consideration; No Fraudulent Conveyance), the Indemnified Party shall, and is
obligated to, take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all
indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses hereunder, and the costs
incurred in connection with such mitigation shall be deemed to be
indemnifiable Losses hereunder.

9.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Buyer Parties and the Sellers acknowledge and
agree that, after the Closing, and except (a) with respect to instances of
fraud or willful misconduct by any of the Parties or (b) as expressly provided
elsewhere in this Agreement, the indemnification provisions in this _Article
IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Parties and the
Sellers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parties may not avoid the limitations on liability, recovery and recourse set
forth in this _Article IX_ by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory or liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the SellersÂ’ aggregate liability under this
Agreement shall in no event exceed the Cash Payment pursuant to _Section
1.04_. Nothing in this _Section 9.07_ shall prevent or prohibit a Party from
seeking and/or obtaining specific performance or other injunctive relief as
provided in _Section 6.07_ and _Section 12.10_.

9.08 _Right of Offset_. Without limiting any statutory, equitable or common
law remedy that any Party (or other applicable Person) may have to recover
Losses for a breach of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document by a
party thereto, or other matters described in  _Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section
9.03(a)_, in the event that there is a final judicial determination of such
Losses made by a court or arbitrator with respect to any matters arising
hereunder or under any other Transaction Document, a Party (on behalf of
itself or another applicable Person) shall have the right, but shall not be
required to, satisfy any claim for such indemnification (subject to the terms
and conditions contained in this _Article IX_ ) by reducing any payment (or
portion thereof) hereunder or under any other Transaction Document.

9.09 _Other Indemnification Matters_. All indemnification payments under this
_Article IX_ will be deemed adjustments to the Cash Payment. The right of a
Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee to indemnification or to assert or
recover on any claim shall not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at
any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy of or compliance with, any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. Except to the extent specifically provided in _Section 5.06(a)_,
the waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation
or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based
on such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

or has prevented, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to
occur by October 31, 2013;

(c) by the Sellers, if (i) the Sellers are not in material breach of this
Agreement and there has been a violation or breach by the Buyer Parties of any
covenant (other than a covenant contained in _Section 5.09_, the sole remedy
for which, other than seeking specific performance of such covenant as and to
the extent provided in _Section 12.10_) shall be SellersÂ’ right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to (and if permitted by the terms of) _Section
11.01(e)_, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which
prevents the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Sellers
to complete the Closing and (A) such violation or breach has not been waived

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
11.01(d)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation or condition under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, such injunction, judgment, order or ruling.

(e) by the Sellers if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature would be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) the Buyer Parties have not consummated

is terminated (or deemed to be terminated) by Sellers pursuant to _Section
11.01(e)_, the Parties agree that (i) the Termination Fee shall be and shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages, and (ii) SellersÂ’ right to terminate this
Agreement, pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 11.01(e)_, and to
receive the Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section
11.02_, shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers and their
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby with respect to any breach of this Agreement by Buyer
Parties, and (iii) in no event shall the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates seek any damages or any other recovery, judgment of any kind, at
law or in equity or otherwise, including, without limitation, any direct,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages, other than the Termination Fee,
against Buyer Parties or its Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives, directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members
or equityholders, in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or any
breach or alleged breach hereof, and (iv) upon payment of the
Termination Fee, the Buyer Parties will be deemed forever released from any
further obligation or liability under or with respect to this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained

 



\- 80 -  in this _Section 11.02_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, no Party
would enter into this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 11.02_ are

Party.

Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.01_, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any

XI_ and pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, which each shall survive
the termination of this Agreement as applicable and in accordance with their
terms;  _provided_ , _however_ , that except as provided in _Section 11.02_,
the termination of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any
termination pursuant to _Sections 11.01(b)(ii)_ or _11.01(c)(ii)_ but
excluding a termination pursuant to (or deemed pursuant to) _Section
11.01(e)_) shall in no way limit any claim by a Party that another Party
willfully breached the terms of this Agreement prior to or in connection with
such termination, including by failing to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall such right of termination limit the
right of such non-breaching Party to seek specific performance to the extent
provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the Buyer Lenders shall have any
liability to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any other Person (other
than the Buyer Parties and its permitted assigns in respect of the Financing)
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law
or equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, and none of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates or any other Person (other than the Buyer Parties and its
permitted assigns in respect of the financing) shall have any rights or

12.04 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,

by the Parties. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall

preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall
any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between the Parties. No
extension of time for performance of any obligations or other acts hereunder
or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of the time
for performance of any other obligations or any other acts.

 



\- 82 - 12.05 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. The rights and obligations of this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or implied herein or

12.07 _Interpretation; Schedules_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit, such
reference shall be deemed to be to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The headings contained herein and on the Schedules are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or the Schedules. The specification of
any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules hereto is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items
so included, are or are not required to be disclosed, and neither Party shall
use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of
any such item in the Schedules in any dispute or controversy with any Party as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
a Schedule hereto is or is not required to be disclosed (including, without
limitation, whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material). The disclosure of any information concerning a matter in the
Disclosure Schedule does not imply that any other undisclosed matter that has
a greater significance or value is material. The disclosure of an item in one
section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed a disclosure of
such item in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule unless referred to
specifically in such other section or such cross reference can be reasonably
inferred when taking into consideration the item being disclosed. The
Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in sections corresponding to the
numbered sections of this Agreement. The information contained in the
Schedules hereto is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and
no information contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any
Party to any Third Party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation
of Law or breach of any agreement. The representations and warranties of one
Party shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the other Party (or by any of its
advisors, consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that such
other Party or any of its advisors, consultants or representatives knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is or might be
inaccurate.

12.08 _Governing Law; Interpretation_. All matters relating to
the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



\- 83 - 12.09 _Forum Selection and Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties to
this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any Federal court
of the United States of America sitting within New Castle County in the State
of Delaware), and any respective appellate court, in any action or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in
connection with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such action or Proceeding
except in such courts; (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or Proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware Chancery Court or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court; (c) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
Proceeding in any such Delaware Chancery Court or Federal court; and (d)

personal jurisdiction or an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
action or Proceeding in any such Delaware Chancery Court or Federal court.
Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 12.01_. Nothing in
this Agreement shall affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.

12.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that, subject to _Section
11.02_ and _Section 12.10(b)_, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.01_, such non-breaching party shall have the right,
in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or
in equity, to enforce its rights and the other partyÂ’s obligations hereunder
not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Sellers
shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the Buyer PartiesÂ’
obligations set forth in _Section 5.09_, but that Sellers shall not be
entitled to seek monetary damages for any breach by Buyer PartiesÂ’ of such
obligations (other than the Termination Fee). Additionally, it is explicitly
agreed that the Sellers shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
Buyer PartiesÂ’ obligation to effectuate the Closing and deliver the Estimated
Cash Payment at the Closing as required hereunder if and only if (i) the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature would be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to such conditions being satisfied assuming a Closing would occur)
and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to 

 



\- 84 -  be satisfied, (ii) the Buyer Parties are required to complete the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.01_, (iii) the Financing has been funded or the
lenders party to the Financing Commitment have irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice delivered to the Buyer Parties that (A) all conditions to the
funding of the Financing have been satisfied (other than any condition that by
its nature would be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such condition
being satisfied assuming a Closing would occur) and (B) the Financing will be
funded at the Closing if the Buyer Parties consummate the Closing, (iv) the
Sellers have irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to the Buyer
Parties that, if an order of specific performance is granted and the Financing
is funded, then the Closing will occur, and (v) the Buyer Parties have not
consummated the Closing within three (3) Business Days of the notice referred
to in clause (iv).

12.11 _Arm Â’s Length Negotiations; Drafting_. Each Party herein expressly
represents and warrants to the other Parties that before executing this
Agreement, said Party has fully informed itself of the terms, contents,
conditions and effects of this Agreement; said Party has relied solely and
completely upon its own judgment in executing this Agreement; said Party has
had the opportunity to seek and has obtained the advice of counsel before

construed against one Party or another as the drafting Party.

applicable securities regulation, or as otherwise permitted or expressly
contemplated herein, no Party or its respective Affiliates, employees, agents
and representatives shall disclose to any Third Party the existence of this
Agreement or the subject matter or terms hereof without the prior consent of
the other Party hereto. Except as required by Law or applicable securities
regulation, no press release or public announcement related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, or prior to the Closing, any other

insureds, reinsurers, landlords or other third parties having relations with
the Retail Group, shall be issued or made by any Party without the approval of
the other Party.

 

12.13 _Third Party Beneficiary or Rights to Rely_. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to or shall create for or grant to any Third Party (including
without limitation to any former, current or future employees or officers of
any Party, any Affiliate or any labor union) any rights whatsoever, as a Third
Party beneficiary or otherwise; no Third Party is entitled to rely on any
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein;
and no Party hereto shall incur any liability or obligation to any Third Party
because of any reliance by such Third Party on any representation, warranty,
