(f) _Parent Board Members_.

  



  

(i) As of the Agreement Date, the Parent Board consists of seven

Parent General Meeting, at which the Parent Board proposes to the Parent
Stockholders to adopt the Parent Capital Increase Resolution. Such
resignations shall at the latest be delivered in writing to Parent prior to
the invitation of the Parent General Meeting at which the Parent Board
proposes to the Parent Stockholders to adopt the Parent Capital Increase
Resolution.

  



  

(ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent
Board to propose to the Parent General Meeting, at which the Parent Board

2019 ( _Entlastung f ur das Geschaftsjahr 20_19) and (C) subject to the
occurrence of the registration of the execution of the Parent Capital Increase
in the commercial register of Parent, elect the two persons set forth on
_Schedule 1.1(f)(ii)_ as members of the Parent Board, each for a term until
the end of the Parent General Meeting which is to vote on the discharge of
the Parent Board members for the financial year 2019 ( _Entlastung f ur das
Geschaftsjahr 2019_) (unless such persons are ineligible under mandatory
statutory law at the time of their respective election, in which case the
Holders' Representative may propose alternative candidates reasonably
acceptable to Parent from amongst the persons comprising the Company Board as
of the Agreement Date).

  



  

(iii) If the persons set forth on _Schedule 1.1(f)(ii)_ are not elected
as members of the Parent Board by the Parent General Meeting as provided in
_Section 1.1(f)(ii)_ above, Parent shall, to the extent legally
permissible, use its reasonable best efforts to cause as promptly as
reasonably possible after the registration of the execution of the
Parent Capital Increase in the commercial register of Parent, to be filed
with the competent court a motion proposing to the court to appoint those two
persons set forth on _Schedule 1.1(f)(ii)_ as members of the Parent Board
(unless such persons are ineligible under mandatory statutory law at the time
of their respective appointment, in which case Holders' Representative may
propose alternative candidates reasonably acceptable to Parent from amongst
the persons comprising the Company Board as of the Agreement Date).

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) If the persons set forth on _Schedule 1.1(f)(ii)_ are not elected
as members of the Parent Board as provided in _Section 1.1.(f)(ii)_ above nor
appointed pursuant to _Section 1.1.(f)(iii)_ , the Parent Board shall, to the
extent legally permissible, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Board to propose to the ordinary Parent General Meeting 2019 (
_ordentliche Hauptversammlung_ ) in which all Parent Board members have to be
elected, the election of the persons set forth on _Schedule 1.1(f)(ii)_ as
members of the Parent Board for a term until the end of the Parent General
Meeting which is to vote on the discharge of the Parent Board members for the
financial year 2019 ( _Entlastung f ur das Geschaftsjahr 2019_) (unless such
persons are ineligible under mandatory statutory law at the time of their
respective appointment, in which case Holders' Representative may propose
alternative candidates reasonably acceptable to Parent from amongst the
persons comprising the Company Board as of the Agreement Date).

  



   | Section 1.2| _Effect on Capital Stock, Options and Warrants_.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and
Company Warrants_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any party hereto, any Company Stockholder, Optionholder,
Warrantholder or any other Person:

  



  

(i) _Company Capital Stock_. Each share of Company Capital Stock that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares and shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
or by Parent or Merger Sub) shall be cancelled and automatically converted
directly into the rights and claims of the Company Stockholders vis-a-vis the
Contribution Agent under the Contribution Agent Agreement, and thereby
indirectly into the right to receive (A) the Per Share Closing Payment and
(B) such Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Post-Closing Cash
Consideration, if and to the extent that any Post-Closing Cash Consideration
is payable to the Company Holders pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and in each case at the times and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 1.2(a)(i)_ above
or anything else herein to the contrary, no fractional Parent ADSs shall be
issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a holder of Parent ADSs. In lieu of any such fractional Parent ADSs,
each holder of a fractional Parent ADS shall be paid an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to the amount of any withholding taxes as
contemplated in _Section 1.6(j)_ ) equal to such holder's proportionate
interest in the sum of (i) the net proceeds from the sale or sales by the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.2(a)(ii),_
on behalf of all such holders, of the Excess Securities and (ii) the
aggregate dividends or other distributions, if any, that are payable
with respect to such Excess Securities pursuant to _Section 1.6(g)_ (such
dividends and distributions being herein called the " _Fractional Dividends_
"). In connection with the foregoing:

  



  

(A) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of Parent ADSs
into which the Company Capital Stock was converted pursuant to _Section
1.2(a)(i)_ over (y) the aggregate number of whole Parent ADSs to which the
former holders of Company Capital Stock are entitled pursuant to _Section
1.2(a)(i)_ (such excess being herein called the " _Excess Securities_ ") and
the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Company Capital Stock,
shall sell the Excess Securities at the prevailing prices on the NYSE American
LLC (" _NYSE American_ "). The sale of the Excess Securities by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on the NYSE American through one or more member firms
of the NYSE American and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. The Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of sale of the
Excess Securities all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of Excess Securities.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(B) Until the net proceeds of such sale of Excess Securities and the
Fractional Dividends have been distributed to the former stockholders of
Company, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds and dividends for the
benefit of such former stockholders. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to former stockholders of
Company for any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available
in accordance with this Agreement such amounts to such former stockholders.

  



  

(iii) _Company Options_.

  



  

(A) _Vested Options_. The portion of each Company Option that is
vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (each
such portion, a " _Vested Option_ ") and that has an exercise price per share
less than the Per Share Merger Aggregate Consideration shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding, equal to (1) the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such
Vested Option _multiplied by_ (y) the applicable Per Option/Warrant Closing
Payment and (2) the applicable Company Holder's Pro Rata Portion of the Post-
Closing Cash Consideration in respect of such Vested Option, if and to the
extent that any Post-Closing Cash Consideration is payable to the Company
Holders pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and in each case
at the times and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each
Vested Option that has an exercise price per share greater than or equal to
the Per Share Merger Aggregate Consideration shall be cancelled and
extinguished at the Effective Time without any present or future right to
receive any portion of the Merger Aggregate Consideration or any other
consideration.

  



  

(B) _Unvested Options_. The portion of each Company Option that is not
a Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such portion,
an " _Unvested Option_ ") shall be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective
Time without any present or future right to receive any portion of the Merger
Aggregate Consideration or any other consideration.

  



  

(iv) _Company Warrants_. Each Company Warrant, whether vested or
unvested, that has a per share exercise price that is less than the Per
Share Merger Aggregate Consideration and is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Cash-Out Warrant_ ") shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding, equal to (A) the product
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out
Warrant multiplied by the applicable Per Option/Warrant Closing Payment and
(B) the applicable Company Holder's Pro Rata Portion of the Post-Closing Cash
Consideration in respect of such Cash-Out Warrant, if and to the extent that
any Post-Closing Cash Consideration is payable to the Company Holders
pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and in each case at the
times and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Company
Warrant that is not a Cash-Out Warrant, whether vested or unvested, shall be
cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time without any present or future
right to receive any portion of the Merger Aggregate Consideration or any
other consideration.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company and

converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Aggregate Consideration, if any, to which such holder

(d) _Payment and Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within three Business Days)
after the Effective Time, send to each Company Stockholder of record holding
a Certificate (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall
be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
mutually agree upon prior to the Closing Date) and (y) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Aggregate Consideration payable in respect thereof.

  



  

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), or, if later,
following receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Parent ADSs to be issued to the
Exchange Agent as provided above, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a Parent ADR representing that
number of whole Parent ADSs that such holder has the right to receive as part
of the Merger Aggregate Stock Consideration, and (B) such portion of the
Merger Aggregate Closing Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the terms hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. Until such time as a Parent ADR representing
Parent ADSs is issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered
Certificate, the respective Parent ADSs, and Parent Ordinary Shares
underlying such Parent ADSs, shall be held in trust by the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. Each outstanding Certificate
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, only to evidence the right
to receive upon such surrender the portion of the Merger Aggregate
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented by such Certificate pursuant to the terms hereof. If payment of
such portion of the Merger Aggregate Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer in accordance with _Section 1.6(f)_  and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of such Merger Aggregate Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 1.6(d)_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Aggregate Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated
by this _ARTICLE I_.

  



  

(e) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_.
The Merger Aggregate Consideration paid in respect of shares of
Company Capital Stock upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE I_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Capital Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close
of business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter no further
transfer of any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on such
stock transfer books. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by Applicable Law. Subject to _Section
1.6(h)_ , if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE I_.

  



  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
the fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable portion of the Merger Aggregate
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _ARTICLE I_.

  



    

 | 11|

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Closing with
respect to Parent ADSs, or Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Parent
ADSs, with a record date after the Closing will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered shares of Company Capital Stock with respect to Parent ADSs
issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash in lieu of fractional Parent
ADSs shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder of record of the
Certificate representing such share of Company Capital Stock shall surrender
such Certificate or deliver an affidavit pursuant to _Section 1.6(f)_.
Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or
delivery of such an affidavit, there shall be paid to the holder of Parent
ADRs representing whole Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor, any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Closing theretofore paid with respect to such whole
number of Parent ADSs.

  



  

(h) _Termination of Payment Fund_. At any time following the
12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Parent ADSs or the
Initial Payment Amount (including any interest received with respect thereto)
that has not been delivered or disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Applicable Law) to look only to Parent as general
creditors thereof.

  



  

(i) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Aggregate
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

  



  

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to a Company Holder pursuant hereto and shall
pay to the appropriate Taxing Authority such amounts that are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Applicable Law.
To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority in the manner required by Applicable Law, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



   | Section 1.7| _Purchase Price Adjustment_.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent (i) not later
than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a draft of the
Company Closing Financial Statement and, (ii) not later than two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, a final version of the Company Closing
Financial Statement. The draft and the final Company Closing Financial
Statement each shall include the Company's bona fide, good faith estimates of
the amounts of each of the items required to be set forth therein. The Company
shall consult with Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed during the
Company's preparation of the draft and final Company Closing
Financial Statements and, in preparing such draft and final Company Closing
Financial Statements, shall take into account all comments reasonably made by
Parent.

  



  

(b) Within 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall, at
its expense, prepare and deliver to the Holders' Representative a statement
(the " _Parent Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail
Parent's calculations of the items in the Company Closing Financial
Statement, calculated in accordance with this _Section 1.7_.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the Holders' Representative desires to object to any item in
the Parent Post-Closing Statement, then within 30 days following delivery by
Parent of the Parent Post-Closing Statement (the " _Objection Period_ ") the
Holders' Representative shall provide written notice of such objection to
Parent (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which shall set forth the basis for
such objection in reasonable detail, along with the Holders' Representative's
calculation and proposed modification of each disputed item (each such
disputed item or amount, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and reasonable supporting
documentation and calculations for each such Disputed Item. During the
Objection Period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide the
Holders' Representative (and any accountants or advisors retained by the
Holders' Representative) with reasonable access, subject to reasonable
confidentiality obligations, to the books, records and personnel of the
Surviving Corporation, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice, for the purpose of enabling the Holders' Representative to
review the Parent Post-Closing Statement and the items set forth therein. If
the Holders' Representative does not deliver a Notice of Objection within the
Objection Period, then Parent's calculation of each item contained in the
Parent Post-Closing Statement shall be deemed to be accepted by the Holders'
Representative as final and shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders'
Representative and the Company Holders and shall be deemed final and binding
for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) If the Holders' Representative delivers a Notice of Objection
during the Objection Period, and Parent disputes all or any portion of the
Holders' Representative's proposed modification to the Parent Post-Closing
Statement, then Parent shall notify the Holders' Representative in writing of
such dispute, and Parent and the Holders' Representative shall confer in good
faith for a period of up to 30 days following Parent's receipt of the Notice
of Objection (and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless
otherwise agreed by the Parent and the Holders' Representative, be governed by
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state
rule)).

  



  

(e) If, within the 30-day period set forth in _Section 1.7(c)_
above, Parent and the Holders' Representative cannot resolve one or more
Disputed Items, then Parent and the Holders' Representative shall engage an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to both Parent
and the Holders' Representative (the " _Reviewing Accountant_ ") to review
the Disputed Items or amounts for purposes of calculating such Disputed Item.
The Reviewing Accountant shall, under the terms of its engagement, have no
more than 45 days from the date of engagement within which to render its
written decision with respect to the Disputed Items that are still disputed
by Parent and the Holders' Representative. After such review and a review of
the Surviving Corporation's relevant books and records, the Reviewing
Accountant shall determine the resolution of such remaining Disputed Items,
which determination shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties hereto
and the Company Holders, and enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Merger
Aggregate Adjusted Cash Consideration_ " means the Merger Aggregate Adjusted
Cash Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.7_.

  



  

(f) If the Final Merger Aggregate Adjusted Cash Consideration is
less than the Estimated Merger Aggregate Adjusted Cash Consideration (such
difference, the " _Final Adjustment Shortfall_ "), then Parent and the
Holders' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent, out
of the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the
Final Adjustment Shortfall. In the event the amount of the Final Adjustment
Shortfall is less than the Adjustment Escrow Fund, then Parent and the
Holders' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay from the
balance of the Adjustment Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount minus the Final Adjustment Shortfall to the Exchange Agent (or,
at Parent's election, for amounts paid in respect of Vested Options or the
Company Liquidity Bonus Plan, to the Surviving Corporation or to Parent), for
further distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions. To the extent that the Final Adjustment
Shortfall is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Fund (such difference, the "
_Excess Adjustment Amount_ "), at Parent's election, (i) the Company Holders
shall promptly pay to Parent or its designee an aggregate amount equal to
their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Excess Adjustment Amount or (ii)
Parent shall deduct such excess amount from the then-remaining balance of the
Holdback Fund, if any.

(g) If the Final Merger Aggregate Adjusted Cash Consideration is

Parent's products (other than the applicable Open Source Material itself).

  



  

(k) _Licenses_. Parent and its Subsidiaries have not granted to any
person any license, right, or other permission to use Parent-Owned IP

partners in the ordinary course of business, or otherwise as would not be
reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole) and are under no obligation to grant any such licenses, rights, or
permissions. To the Knowledge of Parent, all of Parent IP Rights other than

or received in connection therewith.

  



  

(m) _No Impact on Parent Intellectual Property Agreements_. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, neither the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will violate or
result in the breach, material modification, cancellation, termination or
suspension of, or acceleration of any payments under, the Parent Intellectual
Property Agreements (or give rise to any right with respect to any of the
foregoing).

  



  

(n) _Contaminants_. To the Knowledge of Parent, the software
included in the Parent Products is substantially free of any material defects,
bugs and errors in accordance with generally accepted industry standards, and

processing systems, facilities and services used by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including all software, hardware, networks, communications
facilities, platforms and related systems and services used by Parent and its

at the Company's request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), under the Company
Organizational Documents in effect as of the Agreement Date as well as
any rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in
employment agreements or indemnification agreements between the Company and
any Company Indemnified Parties (in each cases to the extent consistent with
Applicable Law and with respect to only such documents and agreements in
effect as of the Agreement Date and made available to Parent). Parent, from

bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less
favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of
certain liabilities of directors, officers, employees and agents and
indemnification than are set forth as of the Agreement Date in the Company
Organizational Documents, which provisions in each case shall not be amended,

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in its sole
discretion, and, at Parent's request, shall, purchase run-off coverage for
Company's directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company and
Parent, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
years following the Effective Time in an amount not less than the existing
coverage and that shall have other terms not materially less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. The premiums for
such policy shall be a Company Transaction Expense.

or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall

assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 4.9_ , without relieving Parent of its obligations under this
_Section 4.9_. The obligations under this _Section 4.9_  shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 4.9_ applies without the consent of
such affected Company Indemnified Party.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 4.9_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties, their
heirs, and their representatives.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
no event shall a Company Indemnified Party's right to indemnification,
contribution or advancement reduce such Company Indemnified Party's liability
for his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to
_ARTICLE VIII_.

Section 4.15 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that, for a period of 12 months commencing on the
Closing Date, each Continuing Employee who continues employment with
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or an employing Affiliate thereof), for
so long as such Continuing Employee continues such employment, shall continue
to receive (i) base compensation or pay rate and quarterly cash bonus, cash
commission or other cash incentive compensation opportunities on an aggregate
basis (as applicable to a Continuing Employee) that are substantially
equivalent to such base compensation or pay rate and annual cash bonus, cash
commissions or other cash incentive opportunities provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits that
are, in the aggregate, substantially equivalent to that provided by the
Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of, and
following, the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries will provide credit for
each Continuing Employee's length of service with the Company for all
purposes (including eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under each
benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (or any employing
Affiliate thereof), except that such prior service credit will not be
required to the extent that it results in a duplication of benefits.

  



  

(b) If requested by Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate its 401(k) plan effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and shall provide

evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions so terminating
the 401(k) plan. The Company shall ensure that, following any such
termination, no Person shall have any right thereafter to contribute any
amounts to such 401(k) plan.

(c) This  _Section 4.15_ shall not operate to duplicate any payment
or benefit provided to any Continuing Employee to fund any such payment or
benefit, or to or create any third party rights of causes of action for any
Employee or other Person (including any employee representative, union, or
labor organization). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall or is intended
to (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (ii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or
terminating any of their respective benefit plans in accordance with their
terms, or (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any Employee, or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any other Person, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee (other than the rights of
Company Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 4.9_ ).

Section 4.16 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts, to the extent in its control, to take, or cause to be taken
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the Debt Financing, including, (i) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms (including any "market flex"
provisions related thereto) and subject only to the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (or on such other terms and conditions to the
extent permitted under  _Sections 4.16(b)_ or _4.16(d)_ below), (iii) satisfy
(or obtain a waiver of), on a timely basis, all conditions within the control
of Parent or Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing and (iv) consummate
the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail regarding the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing, including by delivering to the Company drafts of
the material definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing and
otherwise upon reasonable request of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice within two Business Days of (i) any breach,
default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the
Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any
written notice from any Debt Financing Source with respect to (x) any actual
or alleged breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter, or (y) any disagreement between
Parent and any Debt Financing Source as to the availability of the Debt
Financing, that in each case could reasonably be expected to adversely impact
or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the
portion of the Debt Financing that is necessary to consummate the
Transactions. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and
Merger Sub shall (i) provide prompt notification to the Company in writing,
and (ii) if required in order to obtain the funds necessary to consummate the
Transactions, use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources ("
_Alternative Debt Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, not materially less
favorable (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) to Parent and
Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates), than the terms set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related
thereto) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event;  _provided_ that in no event will the reasonable best efforts of
Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub
to (i) pay fees materially in excess of those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter, or (ii) enter into any Alternative Debt Financing the terms of which
are materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the Debt
Commitment Letter. To the extent Parent and Merger Sub obtain Alternative
Debt Financing, Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies
of the commitment letters pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing and the related
fee letter; provided that provisions in the fee letter may be redacted in a
customary manner. For purposes of this Agreement, references to (x) the "Debt
Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced by this _Section 4.16_ and (y) references to the "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced by this _Section 4.16_.

relating to the repayment to the existing Indebtedness of the Company and the
release of related Liens and related guarantees, including customary payoff
letters), (ix) assisting Parent or Merger Sub in its efforts to obtain

_further_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no obligations of the Company
or its Affiliates or Representatives under any agreement, document or
instrument executed or delivered by the Company or its Affiliates or
Representatives pursuant to the Company's obligations under this _Section
4.16_ shall be effective until the Effective Time; and _provided_ , _further_
, that nothing herein shall require such assistance to the extent it would

Time for which it is not reimbursed or indemnified. Parent and Merger Sub
shall reimburse the Company, promptly upon request by the Company, for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with such assistance. In addition, nothing in this
_Section 4.16_  shall require any action that would violate the Company

or delayed), amend, modify, alter, waive, replace or agree to amend, modify,
alter, waive, terminate or replace (in any case whether by action or
inaction), any term of the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, waiver, termination or replacement would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of any portion of the Debt Financing (including by increasing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as compared to the
fees and original issue discount contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
and related fee letter on the Agreement Date) unless an alternative source of
debt financing with substantially similar terms and conditions (and that
would not otherwise impair or materially delay the ability of Parent to

Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing, or (iii) impact or delay in any material

(f) Following the Closing, Parent shall not consummate a refinancing
or replacement of the Debt Financing if any such refinancing or

Holdback Fund is first distributed to each Company Holder or to the Exchange

ARTICLE VIII 
 Survival and Indemnification

  



  

Section 8.1 _Survival_

  



  

Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE VIII,_ if the Merger is
consummated, (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained
herein, or in any other writing delivered in connection with this Agreement,
and the indemnification obligations of the Company Holders for Indemnifiable
Damages pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ii)-(v)_ shall survive until 5:00 p.m.
Pacific time on December 31, 2020 (the date and time of expiration, the "
_Holdback Release Date_ "); (ii) all covenants, agreements and obligations of
the Company shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of the
Closing, except to the extent such covenants, agreements and obligations
provide that they are to be performed after the Closing, which covenants,
agreements and obligations shall expire upon the earlier to occur of their
complete performance and the Holdback Release Date; and (iii) the
indemnification obligations of the Company Holders for Indemnifiable Damages
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ shall survive until 5:00 p.m. Pacific time
on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Claim Notice is delivered in accordance with the terms hereof prior to
the Holdback Release Date, or in the case of claims under _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_
prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the fifth year anniversary of the Closing
Date, then the claim set forth in such Claim Notice shall
continue indefinitely until such claim is finally resolved pursuant to the

representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations of Parent
contained herein, or in any other writing delivered in connection with this
Agreement, shall not survive, and shall terminate and expire upon, the
Closing, and after the Closing shall not provide the basis for any Liability
to any Company Holder or any other Person, except for and to the extent any
such covenants, agreements and obligations expressly provide herein that they
are to be performed after the Closing.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Company Holders_.

  



  

(a) If the Merger is consummated, from and after the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
of this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Company Holders shall, severally (in
accordance with each Company Holder's Pro Rata Portion), but not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Damages, regardless of whether or not such
Indemnifiable Damages relate to any third party claim, if and to the extent
resulting from:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties made
by the Company herein as of the Agreement Date or as of the Closing Date,
including in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company (except
in the case of representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of
a specific date, which representations and warranties shall be true and
correct as of such date); 

  



  

(ii) any breach of or failure to perform on or prior to the Closing
any covenants, agreements or obligations made by or of the Company
herein that are required to be performed on or prior to the Closing;

  



  

(iii) any payments made with respect to Dissenting Shares to the
extent that such payments, in the aggregate, exceed the value of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to _Section
1.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 1.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section 1.2(a)(iv)_ , as applicable,
upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares, and any interest, costs, expenses
and fees incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the exercise of
any appraisal rights;

  



  

(iv) any inaccuracy or miscalculation in the Capitalization
Spreadsheet, including any use of incorrect information and any failure to
properly calculate or describe any payment resulting in any overpayment or
other incorrect payment by or on behalf of Parent;

  



  

(v) any payments made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to any
Company Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 4.9_ ; and

  



  

(vi) any Fraud on the part of the Company (including any
Representative of the Company).

  



  

The foregoing clauses (i)-(vi) are hereinafter referred to together as the "
_Indemnifiable Matters_."

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries suffers, incurs or otherwise
becomes subject to any Indemnifiable Damages as a result of or in connection
with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as Indemnified Parties) Parent shall
also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving
Corporation, to have incurred Indemnifiable Damages as a result of and in
connection with such inaccuracy or breach.

  



  

   

 | 76| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Without limiting the representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 3.24_ , the rights of the
Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement
contained in this _ARTICLE VIII_ relating to the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and obligations of the Company are part of the basis of
the bargain contemplated by this Agreement, and such representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations, and the rights and remedies
that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties with respect thereto, shall
not be waived, limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of (and
the Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have relied upon such
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and
obligations notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of Parent or any of
its Representatives or any of the other Indemnified Parties (regardless of
whether obtained through any investigation by any such Person or through
disclosure by the Company or any other Person, and regardless of whether such
knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement) or by reason of the fact that any such Person knew or should have
known that any representation or warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Limitations_

  



  

Recovery by Indemnified Parties of their Indemnifiable Damages will be
subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) Other than pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ , with respect to
Indemnifiable Damages claimed pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ :

  



  

(i) except as set forth below, no Indemnified Party shall have any
indemnification obligations unless the aggregate amount of all
Indemnifiable Damages (excluding Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(vi_ )) exceeds $5,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the
Indemnified Parties may make claims for the amount of such Indemnifiable
Damages only in excess of the Deductible, subject to the conditions and other
limitations of this _ARTICLE VIII_ ; and

  



  

(ii) an Indemnified Party may recover its Indemnifiable Damages
solely by reclaiming cash from the Holdback Fund.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Deductible shall not apply to
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(vi_ ) and (y) in the case
of claims under _Section 8.2(a)(vi_ ), (A) an Indemnified Party may recover
its Indemnifiable Damages directly from the Company Holders only after
exhausting the available Holdback Fund and (B) the aggregate liability of the
Company Holders for Indemnifiable Damages under this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall not
exceed the total amount of Merger Aggregate Consideration actually received
by such Company Holders hereunder.

  



  

(b) The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any
Indemnifiable Damages relating to any Indemnifiable Matter arising
pursuant to one provision of this Agreement to the extent that the
Indemnified Parties have already recovered the same Indemnifiable
Damages with respect to such Indemnifiable Matter pursuant to any other
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The amount of Indemnifiable Damages payable by a Company Holder
under this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds
received from an insurance carrier by the Indemnified Party with respect
thereto (net of any costs or recovery, applicable deductibles, premium
adjustment (retroactive or prospective) or similar costs or payments), and
(ii) indemnity or contribution amounts received from third parties (net of any
applicable costs of recovery or collection thereof); _provided_ that if an
Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds, indemnity or contribution
amounts, after having received payment from (or on behalf of) any Company
Holder with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages, such Indemnified Party
shall refund such Company Holder up to the lesser of (x) the amount of the
insurance proceeds received and (y) the amount of indemnification received by
the Indemnified Party from the Company Holders.

  



  

   

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) For the purpose of determining the failure of any
representations or warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any
covenants and agreements, and the amount of the Indemnifiable Damages pursuant
to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , any "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifiers or words of similar import contained in such representation or
warranty shall in each case be disregarded and without effect.

  



  

(e) The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages to the
extent required by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

  



  

(a) _Direct Claims for Indemnification_. Parent shall administer
all claims for indemnification on behalf of the Indemnified Parties.
Parent, on behalf of an Indemnified Party that seeks recovery of
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , shall deliver to the
Holders' Representative a Claim Notice in respect of such claim.

  



  

(i) To be valid pursuant to this _Section 8.4(a)_ , a Claim Notice
relating to any Indemnifiable Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(i)-(v)_  must be
delivered to the Holders' Representative prior to the Holdback Release Date
and a Claim Notice relating to any Indemnifiable Damages under _Section
8.2(a)(vi)_ must be delivered to the Holders' Representative prior to 5:00
p.m. Pacific time on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_
that any claims by Parent (on behalf of any Indemnified Party) with respect
to any such Indemnifiable Damages made prior to the applicable Holdback
Release Date shall continue indefinitely until such claim is resolved
pursuant to the terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_. The date of such delivery of a
Claim Notice is referred to herein as the " _Claim Date_ " of such Claim
Notice (and the claims for indemnification contained therein).

  



  

(ii) " _Claim Notice_ " means a notice delivered by Parent (on behalf
of an Indemnified Party): (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
sustained or incurred, or reasonably anticipates in good faith that it will
have to pay, sustain or incur Indemnifiable Damages and (ii) specifying or
estimating in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the Indemnifiable
Damages included in the amount so stated (including, in the case of claims
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ , to the extent known, the
applicable representation and warranty claimed to be inaccurate), and the
nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to which such item is related. 

  



  

(iii) The Holders' Representative may object to a claim for
indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice by delivering to Parent within 30
days from the delivery by Parent of a Claim Notice (such date, the "
_Objection Deadline_ "), a written statement of objection to the claim made
in the Claim Notice (an " _Objection Notice_ "), which Objection Notice shall
set forth the nature of the objections to the claims in respect of which the
objection is made. If the Holders' Representative does not object in writing
by the Objection Deadline, such failure to so object shall be an
acknowledgment by the Holders' Representative and the Company Holders that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claims
for Indemnifiable Damages set forth in such Claim Notice, and Parent shall be
entitled to reclaim the full amount of such claim in cash from the Holdback
Fund.

  



  

(b) _Resolution of Conflicts_.

  



  

(i) If the Holders' Representative timely delivers an Objection
Notice in accordance with _Section 8.4(a)_ , the Holders' Representative and
Parent (on behalf of the Indemnified Party) shall attempt in good faith for 30
days to resolve such dispute. If the Holders' Representative and Parent reach
an agreement with respect to such dispute, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties (a " _Settlement
Memorandum_ ") (any claims covered by such an agreement, " _Settled Claims_
").

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If the Holders' Representative and Parent (on behalf of the
Indemnified Party) are unable to reach an agreement with respect to such
dispute after good faith negotiation during the aforementioned 30-day period
following delivery of an Objection Notice with respect to such claim, any
party to such dispute may institute Legal Proceedings in accordance with
_Section 8.5_ with respect to the matter unless the amount of the
Indemnifiable Damages that are at issue is the subject of a pending Legal
Proceeding with a third party, in which event such Legal Proceedings shall
not be commenced until such amount is ascertained, or both parties otherwise
agree. Any final and non-appealable decision, judgment or award rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or any consummation of
arbitration, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Notice
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto and any other
Company Holders and Indemnified Parties. If reasonably possible, such final
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions that shall set forth the decision, judgment or award awarded
by such Governmental Authority or arbitrator(s) (a " _Written Decision_ "),
and Parent shall be entitled to reclaim cash from the Holdback Fund (subject
to the limitations of this _ARTICLE VIII_ ) consistent with such Written
Decision.

  



  

(c) _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Company Holders,
the Holders' Representative and Parent agree to treat (and cause
their Affiliates to treat) any payments received pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VIII_ as adjustments to the Merger Aggregate Adjusted Cash Consideration for
all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Legal Proceeding is instituted, or that
any claim is asserted, by any Person not party hereto in respect of an
Indemnifiable Matter against an Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party (or Parent on behalf thereof) shall promptly notify
the Holders' Representative of any such claim (describing the claim, the
amount therefor (in known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in
reasonable detail) of which it has knowledge. The failure to so notify the
Holders' Representative of the commencement of any such Third-Party Claim will
relieve the Company Holders from liability in connection therewith only if
and to the extent that such failure adversely affects the defense of such
Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(b) The Holders' Representative shall have the right, at its sole
option and expense (on behalf of the Company Holders), to be represented by
counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party
Claims and if the Holders' Representative elects to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim, it shall within 30 days
(or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires) (the "
_Dispute Period_ ") notify Parent of its intent to do so.

  



  

(c) If the Holders' Representative does not elect within the Dispute
Period to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-
Party Claim, Parent (on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Party) may defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holders'
Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Company Holders, at their
expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of
such Third-Party Claim or other Third-Party Claim for which an Indemnified
Party assumes the defense. Such Indemnified Party that assumes the defense of
such Third-Party Claim shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct
the defense of any such claim; _provided_ that any settlement or consent to
the entry of judgment with respect to any such claim without the
prior written consent of the Holders' Representative shall not be
determinative, in and of itself, of the existence or amount of Indemnifiable
Damages relating to such matter.

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If the Holders' Representative elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim, (i)
the Holders' Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
defend such Third-Party Claim, (ii) Parent (on behalf of the applicable
Indemnified Party), prior to the period in which the Holders' Representative
assumes the defense of such matter, may take such reasonable actions to
preserve any and all rights with respect to such matter, without such
actions being construed as a waiver of such Indemnified Party's rights to
defense and indemnification pursuant hereto, but with such actions not being
determinative of the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages except to the extent
the Holders' Representative's ability to defend such action is materially
prejudiced by such actions and (iii) Parent (on behalf of the applicable
Indemnified Party) may participate in (but may not direct or control) the
defense of such Third-Party Claim at its own expense; _provided_  that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the Company Holder if, (A) so
requested by the Holders' Representative to participate or (B) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Holders' Representative that would make such separate representation
advisable; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Holders shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Holders' Representative shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment (each, a "
_Settlement_ ") unless (i) the claimant and the Holders' Representative
provide to such Indemnified Party an unqualified release from all liability in
respect of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) such Settlement does not impose any
liabilities or obligations on the Indemnified Party and (iii) with respect to
any non-monetary provision of such Settlement, such provisions would not, in
the Indemnified Party's reasonable judgment, have or be reasonably expected
to have any adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, condition
(financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of the
Indemnified Party. Any settlement or compromise that does not comply with the
preceding sentence shall not be determinative of the amount of Indemnifiable
Damages with respect to any related claims for indemnification pursuant to
this _ARTICLE VIII_.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto agree to (i) cooperate with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third-
Party Claim, (ii) make available witnesses in a timely manner to provide
testimony through declarations, affidavits, depositions, or at hearing or
trial and to work with each other in preparation for such events consistent
with deadlines dictated by the particular Third-Party Claim and (iii)
preserve all documents and things required by litigation hold orders pending
with respect to particular Third-Party Claims, and to provide such documents
and things to each other, consistent with deadlines dictated by a particular
matter, as required by legal procedure or court order, or if reasonably
requested by another party hereto, provided such cooperation referenced in
clauses (i) - (iii) would not reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of
any attorney-client, work product or other privilege.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Holdback Fund_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold the Holdback Amount
from the Merger Aggregate Consideration otherwise payable to each Company
Holder pursuant to _Section 1.2_ and/or the Company Liquidity Bonus Plan in
accordance with each such Company Holder's Pro Rata Portion. The balance of
the Holdback Fund shall accrue interest at the Applicable Rate from the
Closing Date until the earlier to occur of (a) the release and payment of the
Holdback Fund to the Company Holders pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_ and (b) the
exhaustion of the Holdback Fund pursuant to claims for Indemnifiable Damages

(b) Promptly following (and in any event no later than five Business
Days after) the Holdback Release Date, Parent shall distribute to
each Company Holder or to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to each
Company Holder, such Company Holder's Pro Rata Portion of any balance of the
Holdback Fund, less (i) any amounts that would be necessary in the reasonable
judgment of Parent to satisfy any then pending and unsatisfied or unresolved
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ delivered to the
Holders' Representative prior to the Holdback Release Date if such claim(s)
were resolved in full in favor of the Indemnified Parties (which amounts will
continue to be withheld until the related claims have been finally resolved)
and (ii) any applicable withholding Tax relating to such amount. Promptly
following the time that any such pending and unsatisfied or unresolved claims
have been resolved, Parent shall deliver the remaining portion of such
undistributed amount, if any, not used to satisfy such claims, and less any
applicable withholding Taxes, to the Company Holders (based on their Pro Rata
Portion).

  



  

(c) Parent shall not be required to set aside or otherwise hold
separate any funds withheld as or otherwise constituting the Holdback Fund. 

  



  

Section 8.7 _Holders ' Representative_.

  



  

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement, each of the Company Holders irrevocably nominates, constitutes
and appoints Fortis Advisors LLC as his, her or its exclusive agent and true
and lawful attorney-in-fact (the " _Holders ' Representative_"), with full
power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the Company
Holders for purposes of executing any documents and taking any actions that
the Holders' Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection with any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this _Article VIII_ or
the resolution of any claims or disputes under _Section 1.7_ or under the
Escrow Agreement. Fortis Advisors LLC hereby accepts its appointment as
Holders' Representative.

  



  

(b) _Authority_. The Company Holders grant to the Holders'
Representative full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and
file on behalf of each such Company Holder (in the name of any or all of the
Company Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the Holders'
Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such provisions as the
Holders' Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by this _Section 8.7_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders' Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Company Holders, except as expressly
provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Representative Engagement
Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Holders' Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Holders' Representative shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Capitalization Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company
Holder or other party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or in any other agreement executed in connection with the Transactions:
(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Representatives
shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Holders' Representative on all
matters relating to any claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ or any claims or disputes under
_Section 1.7_ or pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and (ii) Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and each Company Holder and their
respective Representatives shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Company Holder by the
Holders' Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be
taken on behalf of any Company Holder by the Holders' Representative, as
fully binding upon such Company Holder. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Holders' Representative, including an amendment, extension
or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.4_ ,
shall constitute a decision of the Company Holders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Company Holders and their respective
successors; and all defenses which may be available to any Company Holder to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Holders' Representative taken
in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Representative
Engagement Agreement are waived. The Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders' Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company Holders. The
Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Holders' Representative.

  



    

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Company Holders recognize and intend
that the power of attorney granted in _Section 8.7(a)_ and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Holders'
Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and are
irrevocable, (ii) may be delegated by the Holders' Representative, (iii)
shall survive the death or incapacity of each of the Company Holders, (iv)
shall be binding on any successor thereto and (v) shall survive the delivery
by any Company Holder of an assignment of the whole or any fraction of his,
her, or its interest in the Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Holdback Fund.

  



  

(d) _Replacement_. If the Holders' Representative shall resign or
otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the
Company Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a
majority of the Adjustment Escrow Fund), within 10 days after such
resignation or inability, appoint a successor to the Holders' Representative
(who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter
notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
succeed the Holders' Representative as Holders' Representative hereunder. If
for any reason there is no Holders' Representative at any time, all
references herein to the Holders' Representative shall be deemed to refer to
the Company Holders. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall
survive the resignation or removal of the Holders' Representative or any
member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Indemnification; Representative Expenses_. Certain Company
Holders have entered into an engagement agreement (the "
_Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Holders' Representative to
provide direction to the Holders' Representative in connection with its
services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Representative
Engagement Agreement (such Company Holders, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory
Group_ "). Neither the Holders' Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Holders ' Representative Group_")
shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it as Holders'
Representative except in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence.
The Company Holders on whose behalf the Representative Expense Amount was
contributed to the Representative Expense Fund shall jointly and severally
indemnify the Holders' Representative Group and defend and hold the
Holders' Representative Group harmless from and against any loss, liability,
damage, fee, fine, cost, judgment, amount paid in settlement or expense of
any nature incurred by such Holders' Representative arising out of or in
connection with the administration of its duties as Holders' Representative,
including reasonable legal and skilled professionals' fees and other costs
and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim or
liability in the premises, and expenses incurred in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers (collectively, the " _Representative Expenses_ "),
unless such Representative Expenses shall be caused by such
Holders' Representative's willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Company
Holders acknowledge that the Holders' Representative shall not be required to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges
or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Representative
Engagement Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Furthermore, the Holders' Representative shall not be required to take any
action unless the Holders' Representative has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Holders' Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Holders' Representative in performing such actions.

  



    

 | 82| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Representative Expense Fund_. The Representative Expense
Amount shall be available as a fund for (i) the Representative Expenses
incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the
Representative Engagement Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the
Advisory Group. In the event that the Representative Expense Amount shall be
insufficient to satisfy the expenses of the Holders' Representative, and if
not recovered directly from the Company Holders, prior to the distribution
from the Adjustment Escrow Fund or the Holdback Fund to the Company Holders of
any amounts thereof in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Holders' Representative shall have the right to recover the
Representative Expenses from any remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Fund and/or the Holdback Fund prior to any distribution to the
Company Holders and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to Parent
or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, a certificate setting forth the
Representative Expenses actually incurred. Upon receipt of such certificate,
Parent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable shall pay such Representative
Expenses to the Holders' Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Holders' Representative's right to recover
Representative Expenses shall not prejudice Parent's right to recover the
full amount that Parent is entitled to recover from the Adjustment Escrow Fund
and Holdback Fund pursuant to this Agreement. The Company Holders shall not
receive interest or other earnings on the Representative Expense Fund. The
Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holders' Representative is not
acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with
the Representative Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Company Holders will not receive any interest on
the Representative Expense Fund and assign to the Holders' Representative any
such interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the
Holders' Representative may contribute funds to the Representative Expense
Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Company Holders.
For tax purposes, the Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Holders at the time of
Closing. Any amounts remaining from the Representative Expense Fund shall be
paid to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company Holders (based on
their Pro Rata Portions) at such time as the Holders' Representative
determines to be appropriate.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_

  



  

Subject to _Section 8.6_ , from and after the Effective Time, except for
equitable remedies pursuant to _Section 9.6_ for non-monetary relief, (a)
the rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement set forth in
this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to any breach of this Agreement by the
Company or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or any of the
other matters set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ (meaning, for the avoidance of
doubt, that the survival periods and liability limits set forth in this
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall control notwithstanding any statutory or common law
provisions or principles to the contrary), (b) all applicable statutes of
limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims for Indemnifiable
Damages shall be shortened to the applicable claims periods and survival
periods set forth herein and (c) the Indemnified Parties irrevocably waive
any and all rights they may have to make claims against any Company Holders
under statutory and common law as a result of any Indemnifiable Damages
incurred by the Indemnified Parties with respect to any breach of
this Agreement by the Company or any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty or any of the other matters set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ whether or
not in excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to
this _ARTICLE VIII_.

ARTICLE IX 
 Miscellaneous

  



  

Section 9.1 _Interpretation_.

  



  

(a) When a reference is made herein to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section
of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The table of contents and headings contained herein are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are
used herein, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The "ordinary course of business" means an action taken by a
Person in the ordinary course of such Person's business, consistent with past
practices. Where a reference is made to a Contract, instrument or law, such
reference is to such Contract, instrument or law as amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of law) by succession of comparable successor law
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i)
words of any gender include each other gender and neutral forms of such
words, (ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural
or singular number, respectively, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereto," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire
Agreement, (iv) references to clauses without a cross-reference to a Section
or subsection are references to clauses within the same Section or, if more
specific, subsection, (v) references to any person include the successors and
permitted assigns of that person, (vi) references from or through any date
shall mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively, (vii) the phrases "provide to" and "deliver to" and
phrases of similar import mean that a true, correct and complete paper or
electronic copy of the information or material referred to has been delivered
to the party to whom such information or material is to be provided and
(viii) the phrase "made available to" and phrases of similar import means,
with respect to any information, document or other material of Parent or the
Company, that such information, document or material was made available for
review by the Company or Parent, respectively, and its Representatives in the
virtual data room established by Parent or the Company, respectively, in
connection with this Agreement at least 24 hours prior to the execution of
this Agreement. The symbol "$" refers to United States Dollars. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." References to
a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. All references to
"days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise indicated as a "Business
Day." Unless indicated otherwise, all mathematical calculations contemplated
by this Agreement shall be rounded to the tenth decimal place, except in
respect of payments, which shall be rounded to the nearest whole
United States cent.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule and
each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  



  

(c) For purposes of the dollar thresholds in this Agreement, any
item of revenue or expenditure of a Party or its Subsidiaries (or the value
of any asset of a Party or its Subsidiaries) not denominated in dollars shall
be converted into dollars at the rate of exchange from the applicable foreign
currency as published by the Wall Street Journal as of the end of the last
trading day prior to the applicable date of measurement.

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_

  



  

Subject to Applicable Law, this Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
modified only by written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification is sought; _provided_ that, following the Effective
Time, the written consent of the Holders' Representative shall also be
required to approve any amendment on behalf of the Company. For purposes of
this _Section 9.2_ , the Company Holders agree that any amendment of this
Agreement as to which the Holders' Representative has given its written
consent shall be binding upon and effective against the Company Holders
whether or not they have signed such amendment, supplement or modification.
Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, none of _Sections 9.3_ , _9.5(c)_ , _9.5(d)_ , _9.9_ and
this _Section 9.2_ may be amended, supplemented or modified in a manner
adverse to any Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of
such Debt Financing Source.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Assignment_

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; _provided_ that Parent may collaterally assign its rights
under this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section
9.3_ shall be null and void.

At any time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may, subject to Applicable
Law, (i) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any
other Party, (ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other Party or (iii) waive compliance by the other
Party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise
provided herein, waive any of such Party's conditions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or Holders' Representative, in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. For purposes of this
_Section 9.4_ , the Company Holders agree that any extension or waiver signed
by the Holders' Representative shall be binding upon and effective against all
Company Holders whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in
and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard to conflicts of
law principles that would refer a matter to another jurisdiction.

  



    

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Delaware State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such
Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such
Federal court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement) in any Delaware State court or in any such Federal
court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such
suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Applicable Law. Each of the Parties agrees that service of process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at the applicable
address set forth below shall be effective service of process for any suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court.

  



  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each of the Parties (i)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.5_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Sections 9.5(a)_ or _9.5(b)_ to the
contrary, each of the Parties (a) agrees that it will not bring or
support (and it will not support any of its Affiliates in bringing or
supporting) any claim, suit, action or other proceeding (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against or involving any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State
court or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and appellate courts thereof), (b) submits for itself and its property
with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts,
(c) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court, (d) agrees that a final judgment in any such action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law and (e) agrees that any
action arising out of or related to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby that involves any Debt Financing
Source will be governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than New York. Each of the Parties agrees that the mailing
of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section 9.7_ (or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Applicable Law) shall be valid and sufficient service thereof
and the Parties hereby irrevocably waive any objections to service
accomplished in the manner provided herein. The Parties hereby irrevocably
waive all right to a trial by jury in any action or other proceeding against
or involving any Debt Financing Source arising out of this Agreement or the
Debt Financing.

Section 9.6 _Specific Performance_

  



  

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the Company or Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as
applicable, under this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Applicable Law
or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

Section 9.8 _Severability_

  



  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and
conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are
fulfilled to the extent possible. Except as otherwise provided for herein,
nothing contained in any representation or warranty, or the fact that any
representation or warranty may or may not be more specific than any other
representation or warranty, shall in any way limit or restrict the scope,
applicability, or meaning of any other representation or warranty contained
herein.

any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (ii)
except for, after the Effective Time, if the Merger is consummated, the
rights of the Company Holders to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Aggregate Consideration, are not intended to and shall not confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies, other than the rights
of the Company Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 4.9_ ; provided that
the Debt Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of _Sections
9.2_ , _9.3_ , _9.5(d)_ and this _Section 9.9_. The Exhibits to this
Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated into this
Agreement for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

(b) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or
causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the Transactions may only be made against the entities that are
expressly identified as signatories hereto and none of the Debt Financing
Sources, Parent's Affiliates, and any Specified Person of Parent shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. The Company agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek
to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Specified
Person of Parent. Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing,
the Company hereby agrees that (a) no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) to the Company or any Company Holder for any claims, causes of
action, obligations or losses arising under, out of, in connection with or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach

Section 9.10 _Legal Representation; Conflict Waiver_

  



  

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Holders' Representative and the Company
Holders, on the other hand, Fenwick and West LLP (" _Fenwick_ ") may represent
the Holders' Representative and the Company Holders in such dispute even
though the interests of the Holders' Representative and the Company Holders
may be directly adverse to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that this sentence shall not apply if
Fenwick is handling ongoing matters for Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") that relate primarily
to the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the attorney-
client privilege and the exception of client confidence belongs solely to the
Seller Group and may be controlled only by the Seller Group (and the Holders'
Representative, on behalf of the Seller Group) and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, because the interests of Parent
and its Affiliates were directly adverse to the Company, the Company Holders
and the Holders' Representative at the time such communications were made.
This right to the attorney-client privilege shall exist even if such
communications may exist on the Surviving Corporation's computer system or in
documents in the Surviving Corporation's possession. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and a Person other than a Party to
this Agreement, on the other hand, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to
such third-party of confidential communications by Fenwick; _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation may not waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Holders' Representative.
