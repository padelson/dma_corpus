OF SHARES  ---------------------------   2.1 Purchase and Sale of Shares.
On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (and based on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement), the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller
agrees to sell to the Buyer, all of the Shares for the consideration
specified below in this Section 2.   2.2 Purchase Price.   (a) The Buyer
agrees to pay to the Seller at the Closing the Purchase Price by delivery of
cash for the Purchase Price payable by wire transfer or delivery of other
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
Seller.   (b) At the Closing, API and the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer
two irrevocable letters of credit issued by U.S. Bank, National Association
to secure API and/or the Seller\'s indemnification obligations under this
Agreement. The first letter of credit shall be in the face amount of
$5,000,000 and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.2A hereto (the
"Tax Claim Letter of Credit"). The Tax Claim Letter of Credit shall secure
solely the indemnification obligations of API and the Seller contained in (i)
Section 5.11 and (ii) Section 8.3(a) to the extent, and solely to the extent,
that indemnification is required under said Section 8.3(a) due to a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.12 hereof (in
either instance, the claim to which any such indemnification relates is
referred to herein as a "Tax Claim"). The second letter of credit shall be in
the face amount of $2,500,000 and shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit 2.2B hereto (the "Non-Tax Claim Letter of Credit" and, collectively
with the Tax Claim Letter of Credit, the "Letters of Credit"). The Non-Tax
Claim Letter of Credit shall secure any and all claims for indemnification
made by the Buyer hereunder that is not a Tax Claim (a "Non-Tax Claim" and,
collectively with a Tax Claim, a "Claim").  The Buyer agrees that it will
not draw under any Letter of Credit unless (w) API and the Buyer agree that a
Claim is payable, (x) the Buyer obtains a final, nonappealable judgment that
a Claim is payable, (y) in the case of the Tax Claim Letter of Credit, the
Buyer has notified API in writing of a Tax Claim, and the amount of the Tax
Claim exceeds the amount to which the Letter of Credit will by its terms
reduce, in which case the Buyer shall be entitled, no sooner than 30 days
prior to the scheduled date of reduction, to draw the difference between the
Tax Claim and the amount to which the Tax Claim Letter of Credit is to
be reduced; provided, however, that nothing in this clause (y) shall preclude
the Buyer from simultaneously making any drawing under the Tax Claim Letter
of Credit pursuant to the following subsection (z), or (z) (i) in the case of
the Non-Tax Claim Letter of Credit, the Buyer has notified API of a Non-Tax
Claim and the Non-Tax Claim Letter of Credit will expire within 30 days or
(ii) in the case of the Tax Claim Letter of Credit, the Tax Claim Letter of
Credit will expire within 30 days; provided that, in the case of draws
permitted by subsections (y) or (z) above, API shall have the right to
deliver to the Buyer an original amendment to the relevant Letter of Credit
extending the date of its reduction   9   or expiry and, if API delivers
an amendment to the relevant Letter of Credit extending its date of reduction
or expiry, the Buyer shall have no right to draw under the relevant Letter of
Credit solely by reason of the events described in subsections (y) or (z)
until at least 10 days before the extended date of reduction or expiry.  
2.3 Cash Dividend to the Seller. Immediately prior to the Closing,
but subject to Section 2.4(a), the Seller will cause the Company to pay the
Seller an amount (and may cause each Subsidiary of the Company to pay to the
Company any necessary component thereof) equal to the Seller\'s good faith
estimate of the consolidated Cash of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of
the Closing. The Seller may cause (i) the Company to make any such payment to
it in the form of a dividend or a redemption and (ii) any Subsidiary of the
Company to make any such payment to the Company in the form of a dividend or
a redemption. Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be subject to
the indemnity in Section 5.11(a).   2.4 Minimum Net Equity of Company and
its Subsidiaries.   (a) API and the Seller, jointly and severally, guarantee
to the Buyer that the Minimum Net Equity as of the Closing Date will be at
least US $40,773,519.   (b) API and the Seller shall prepare a consolidated
balance sheet (the "June Balance Sheet") and statement of income of Company
and its subsidiaries as of and for the period beginning September 1, 1999 and
ended after June 1, 2000, but prior to June 10, 2000 (the date between June
1, 2000 and June 10, 2000 selected by API and Seller is referred to herein as
the "Applicable Balance Sheet Date") and such balance sheet and statement of
income are referred to collectively as the "June Financial Statements". The
June Balance Sheet shall be prepared based upon the results of a physical
inventory to be conducted on or about the Applicable Balance Sheet Date and
otherwise in accordance with the accounting assumptions, methodologies
principles and procedures used to prepare the Recent Balance Sheet, including
the same procedures as would be applicable if the June Balance Sheet was
prepared as of the end of a fiscal month. Also, API shall cause Seller\'s
Accountant\'s to perform certain agreed upon procedures related to the
accounting assumptions, methodologies and principles used to prepare the June
Balance Sheet, and such agreed upon procedures shall be reasonably acceptable
to Buyer\'s Accountants (as hereinafter defined) (the "Agreed Upon Procedures
Report"). The Seller\'s Accountants shall propose such agreed upon procedures
on or before May 10, 2000 and the Seller\'s Accountants and Buyer\'s
Accountants shall negotiate in good faith to finalize such agreed upon
procedures on or before May 22, 2000. Upon completion of the preparation of
the June Balance Sheet by API, API shall deliver the June Financial
Statements to Buyer together with Seller\'s Accountant\'s Agreed Upon
Procedure Report on the accounting assumptions, methodologies used to prepare
the June Balance Sheet. The Agreed Upon Procedures Report will analyze the
assumptions, methodologies, and principles employed in preparing the June
Balance Sheet and note any differences and to the extent practicable
quantifying these differences. Based solely upon the June Balance Sheet,
the   10   Seller will deliver its computation of the Minimum Net Equity
as of the Applicable Balance Sheet Date, together with all supporting
documents relating thereto (including the June Financial Statements and the
Agreed Upon Procedures Report), to the Buyer at least ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date. API and the Seller shall grant to Buyer and Arthur Andersen
LLP, certified public accountants ("Buyer\'s Accountants"), full access to
the books, records and management of the Company and it Subsidiaries for the
purpose of verifying its computation of the Minimum Net Equity, shall permit
Buyer\'s Accountants to observe the physical inventory to be conducted in
connection with the Seller\'s computation of Minimum Net Equity as of the
Applicable Balance Sheet Date, and to promptly respond to questions from the
Buyer\'s Accountant\'s with respect to the computation of the Minimum Net
Equity (both prior to the final computation thereof and following the
delivery of the June Financial Statements). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) in no event shall the June Balance Sheet be prepared
unless all of the events referred to in the definition of the terms
Distributions and Restructuring have occurred (other than the events
described in clause (ix) thereof) and (ii) if the Closing Date shall occur at
any time after July 15, 2000, then all references herein to the Applicable
Balance Sheet Date shall be deemed to refer to the last day of the calendar
month immediately preceding the Closing Date.   ARTICLE 3  WARRANTIES AND

(c) Each such Company Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan has
received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to
the effect that it meets the requirements of Code (S)401(a) (and each Company
Plan intended to be a tax-favored pension scheme has received Inland Revenue

requirements for tax-registered or tax-favored plans of foreign
jurisdictions) and nothing has occurred or is expected to occur through the

tax-favored status or the imposition of any penalty or tax liability.   (d)
No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been threatened, asserted,
instituted or, to the Knowledge of API and Seller, is anticipated against the
Company Plans (other than non-material routine claims for benefits, and

the   27   nature of retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing
arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or

Company Plan is or was subject to Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of
ERISA or Title IV of ERISA.   (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.21(g)(1)
of the Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not give rise to any liability, including, without
limitation, liability for severance pay, unemployment compensation,
termination pay or withdrawal liability or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due any employee,
director or shareholder of the Seller (whether current, former or retired) or

circumstance exists that could result in an increase of the benefits provided
under any Company Plan or the expense of maintaining any Company Plan from
the level of benefits or expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year
ended before the Closing Date. Neither API, the Seller, the Company, nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any unfunded liabilities pursuant to any Company Plan
that is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
that is an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, an excess benefit plan
or a Foreign Employee Plan. No event, condition or circumstance exists that
would prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan.   (h) With
respect to each Foreign Employee Plan, the fair market value of the assets of
each funded Foreign Employee Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Employee Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Employee Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all
current and former participants in such Foreign Employee Plan according to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employee contributions to such Foreign Employee Plan and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.   28    (i) There
is not, and has never been, any unequal treatment in relation to the terms on
which men and women may become members of the BW Pension Plan and the Barry
Controls Life Assurance Plan and the terms on which they are treated, and the

insured with a reputable insurance company on normal terms at normal rates.

Controls Limited and Barry Controls Limited has no liability to make any
payment to or in respect of the BW Pension Plan whether it is in connection

API, Seller and Buyer will use their respective commercially reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in Articles 6 and 7,
respectively, which are required to be satisfied by Buyer and Seller are
satisfied, including without limitation the deliveries provided for therein.
Each of the Buyer, the Seller and API agrees not to take any action
voluntarily that would or would likely result in any of its representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement becoming untrue (including the
accuracy of the Disclosure Schedule) or in any of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Articles 6 and 7 not being satisfied.   5.7 Supplements
to Disclosure Schedule. Prior to the Closing, Seller will promptly supplement

their respective Affiliates become aware (including by reason of notice from
the Buyer) that any tangible assets or Intellectual Property used to conduct
the Business were not transferred, delivered or assigned   34   to the
Company or the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, API, Seller and their
respective Affiliates shall take all action reasonably necessary to promptly
cause such transfer, delivery or assignment or any such tangible assets or
Intellectual Property to Buyer. Because any breach of this covenant
will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Buyer for which the
Buyer may not have an adequate remedy at law, the Buyer shall be entitled in
the event of such breach and adequate proof of such breach, to a decree of
specific performance of this covenant.   5.9 Amounts due to or from the

amounts due to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries from API, Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller as of the Closing, and all amounts due from the Company

the Closing, shall be eliminated prior to the Closing in whatever manner and
transactions Seller and API may implement. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the term "accrued expenses" includes expenses that are typically
charged through the intercompany accounts by API to the Company or any
Subsidiary, or amounts withheld from employees payroll and subsequently paid
to either taxing authorities, or to API for benefit programs, in each case
consistent with past custom and practice as reflected in the Recent Balance
Sheet. Such amounts include, but are not limited to payroll withholding from
employees for Section 125 plans, the Applied Power Stock Purchase plan, 401-k
employee contributions, 401-k payments, employee insurance premiums,

limited to, the 3% 401-k employer core contributions, employer 401-k match,
legal bills for Company (other than in connection with the sale of the stock
of the Company to Buyer and the other transactions contemplated hereby) and
other services such as travel expenses and insurance that are centrally
billed to API for specific services that are in turn charged to the Company
or any Subsidiary (all of which traditionally are expenses in the income
statement of the Company or any Subsidiary).   5.10 Exclusivity. The Seller
and API will not (and will not cause or permit any of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to, and the Seller and API shall not permit or cause any of
their respective officers or directors to, and the Seller and API shall
direct their employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by either of them) not to, directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of any
proposal, inquiry or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of all
or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of any of the Company and
the Subsidiaries (including any acquisition structured as a merger,
consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction) (any such proposal or
offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal").
Neither the Seller nor API will (and each of them will cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries not to), and API will not permit or cause any of its
officers and directors to, and the Seller shall direct its employees, agents
and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data
(including, without limitation, Confidential Information) to, or have any
discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal,  
35   whether made before or after the date of this Agreement, or otherwise
facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal. API will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing. API agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.10.
The Seller will notify the Buyer immediately if any such inquiries, proposals
or offers are received by, any such information requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any
of its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name
of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers. The Seller also will promptly request each Person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal to return all confidential information (including,
without limitation, Confidential Information) heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   5.11
Certain Tax Matters.   (a) Taxes of Other Persons. API and Seller agree to
indemnify the Buyer from and against any liability of any of the Company and
the Subsidiaries for Taxes (i) under Treasury Regulations (S)1.1502-6 (or any

member of the Affiliated Group of which API was the common parent or any
other prior Affiliated Group on or before the Closing other than any Taxes of
the Company and the Subsidiaries, (ii) of, or attributable to, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) on

he extent such inclusion is attributable to earnings accrued during a Pre-
Closing Tax Period of a foreign subsidiary and (vi) on all transactions
contemplated or encompassed by Section 5.15 of this Agreement.   (b)
Returns for Periods Through the Closing Date. API will include the income of
the Company and Barry Controls Corporation (including any deferred income

Treasury Regulations (S)1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into
income under Treasury Regulations (S)1.1502-19) on API\'s consolidated
federal and any applicable state consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax
Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal or state
income Taxes attributable to such income. The Company and Barry Controls
Corporation will furnish Tax information to API for inclusion in API\'s
federal consolidated and any applicable state consolidated, combined or
unitary income Tax Return for the period which includes the Closing Date in
accordance with Company\'s past custom and practice. The income of the
Company and Barry Controls Corporation will be apportioned to the period up
to and including the Closing   36   Date and the period after the Closing

the end of the Closing Date.   (c) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending
After the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed any income Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end

periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which are unpaid and
relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date.   (d)
Audits. API will allow the Company and its counsel to participate at its own
expense in any audits of API\'s consolidated federal income Tax Returns to
the extent that such returns relate to the Company and the Subsidiaries. API
will not settle any such audit in a manner which would adversely affect the
Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date unless such settlement
would be reasonable in the case of a Person that owned the Company and the
Subsidiaries both before and after the Closing Date.   (e) Distributions and
Restructuring. Seller and API agree that all of the transactions contemplated
by the Distributions and Restructuring (as described in Section 1.18 except
for the transactions in clause (ix) thereof), the dividends payments
described in Section 2.3 and the amounts due to or from the Company described
in Section 5.9 will be effectuated and completed no later than the day before

any transaction on the Closing Date outside of the Ordinary Course of its
Business.   (g) No New Accounting Method. API and Seller shall cause

unless Buyer shall provide its written consent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Affiliated Group shall be entitled to file an amended Tax
Return or refund claim on behalf of such Group, provided the adjustments on
such amended Tax Return or such refund claim do not relate to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.   37    (i) Indemnification for Post-Closing
Transactions. Buyer agrees to indemnify API for any additional income Tax
owed by API (including income Tax owed by API due to this indemnification
payment) resulting from any transaction not in the Ordinary Course of
Business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyer\'s purchase of the Shares,
provided that the transaction is initiated at the direction of Buyer.   (j)
Post-Closing Transactions not in the Ordinary Course. Buyer and API agree
that all transactions not in the Ordinary Course of Business occurring on the

situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or
prior to the Closing Date involving the Company and/or any Subsidiary, the
other party will reasonably cooperate with the contesting, or defending party
and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and
provide such testimony and reasonable access to its books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all
at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party (unless the
contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article 8 hereof).   5.14 Post Retirement Liability. The Company is
obligated to provide medical and life insurance benefits to those retired
employees set forth in Section 5.14 of the Disclosure Schedule. API will
assume this liability from Company on or before Closing. After such
assumption by API, neither the Company nor the Buyer shall have any
obligation or liability whatsoever with regard to the provision of medical
and life insurance benefits to such retired employees regardless of whether
such obligation or liability arises as a result of events occurring on,
before or after such assumption.   5.15 Toulouse Operation. Applied Power
Europa S.A., a subsidiary corporation of API conducts a Barry Controls
Aerospace division isolator repair and parts business at its facility in
Toulouse, France (the "Isolator Division"). API agrees to cause Applied Power
Europa S.A. to transfer the assets (tangible and intangible), business and
liabilities of the   38   Isolator Division to such entity as the Buyer
shall designate upon such terms and conditions as are acceptable to Buyer and
API, including the absence of any Security Interest with respect thereto.
Section 5.15 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a balance sheet as of March
31, 2000 of the Isolator Division. A fixed asset listing and inventory
listing for the Isolator Division is included in Sections 3.15 and 3.16 of
the Disclosure Schedule hereto, respectively. API will also cause Applied
Power Europa, S.A. to enter an agreement with such entity regarding temporary
use of the portion of the Toulouse, France facility used by the Isolator
Division upon such terms and conditions as are acceptable to Buyer and
API.   5.16 Restrictive Covenant. For a period of five years after the
Closing Date, none of Seller, API nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly (whether as a shareholder, partner, lender,
consultant, agent, supplier, distributor or in any other relationship or
capacity);   (a) design, develop, manufacture, sell or offer or promote for
sale any product, process, good or service that competes with, any product,
process, good or services of the Business which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries has actually designed, developed, manufactured, sold or offered
or promoted for sale within the three years preceding the date of this
Agreement (collectively, a "Competing Product"), or otherwise engage in any
business which would be competitive with the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as it is now operated or as it has existed during the three
years preceding the date of this Agreement;   (b) employ, otherwise engage,
or offer to employ or otherwise engage, any employee of the Company and the
Subsidiaries except for any employment offers through a general solicitation
not targeted at employees of Company or its Subsidiaries;   (c) solicit any
business from any Person that has been a customer of the Business with
respect to any Competing Product or directly or indirectly influence any
customer, supplier or other person who has a business relationship with the
Business to discontinue or reduce the extent of such relationship with the
Business.   In addition, none of the Seller, API or any of their respective
Affiliates shall ever divulge any trade secrets, customer or supplier lists,
pricing information, marketing arrangements or strategies, business plans,
internal performance statistics, training manuals or other information
concerning the Business that is competitively sensitive or confidential.
Because the breach or attempted or threatened breach of this restrictive
covenant will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Buyer for
which the Buyer may not have an adequate remedy at law, the Buyer may be
entitled in the event of such breach and upon adequate proof of such breach
in addition to all other remedies, to a decree of specific performance of
this covenant and to a temporary and permanent injunction enjoining such
breach, without posting bond or furnishing similar security.   39    The
covenant in Section 5.16(a) shall not apply to any activity of API, Seller or
any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date unrelated to the conduct of
the Business which was conducted by API, Seller, or any of their Affiliates
(other than Company and its Subsidiaries) on or prior to the
Closing Date.   5.17 Permit Transfer, Assignment or Reissuances. API and
Seller will cause each of the Company and the Subsidiaries to assist in the
transfer, assignment or securing of reissuance of any environmental permits,
licenses and other authorizations and in the provision of any required
notice, to the extent that such permits, licenses or other authorizations
required to operate the Business are required under the Environmental,
Health, and Safety Laws to be transferred, assigned or reissued, or
notification is required to be provided, as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement.   5.18 U.S. Pension and Cafeteria
Plans.   (a) On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter,
API shall contribute to the APW 401(k) Plan the matching contribution and any
other employer contribution relating to periods prior to the Closing based on
the amount or percentage that API would otherwise contribute to the APW
401(k) Plan on behalf of each Company employee at the end of the plan year in
which the Closing occurs. In addition, API shall cause all Company employees
with account balances under the APW 401(k) Plan to be fully vested in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.01(f) of the APW 401(k) Plan.  
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.18(f), on the Closing Date or as
soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than 60 days after the
Closing Date), API shall cause the trustee of the APW 401(k) Plan to transfer
to the trustee or funding agent of the retirement plan established
or maintained by Buyer or its affiliates that contains a cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and designated by Buyer
("Buyer 401(k) Plan") for the benefit of the Company employees: (i) an amount
in cash equal to the shares of API common stock held in all of the accounts
of the Company employees under the APW 401(k) Plan plus; (ii) an amount in-
kind equal to the total account balances of the Company employees, excluding
amounts invested in shares of API common stock but including the promissory
notes evidencing any outstanding loans of the Company employees; plus (iii)
actual investment earnings or losses through the date of transfer, held under
the APW 401(k) Plan for the Company employees, except for amounts as to which
withdrawal requests have been duly submitted prior to such transfer and which
API shall cause to be paid by the APW 401(k) Plan to the Company employees in
accordance with the Code and ERISA and the terms of the APW 401(k) Plan
(amounts under (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be referred to as the "Transferred
Assets"). Prior to the transfer of the Transferred Assets, API shall cause
the trustee of the APW 401(k) Plan to liquidate shares of API common stock
held in the accounts of Company employees in accordance with applicable law
and to permit Company employees to direct the investment of such amounts from
among the other investment alternatives available under the APW 401(k) Plan.
In no event shall the Transferred Assets be less than   40   the amount
required under Section 414(l) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
Except as expressly contemplated herein, API and Buyer acknowledge that the
transfer of the Transferred Assets shall be accomplished in a manner designed
to avoid any liquidation of the accounts of the Transferred Employees.   (c)
Subject to the provisions of Section 5.18(f), API represents and warrants
that, with respect to the APW 401(k) Plan no part of the Transferred Assets
are invested in employer securities (as defined in Section 407(d)(1)
of ERISA) as of the date of transfer.   (d) Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.18(f), API and Buyer shall provide each other with such records as
they may reasonably request relating to their respective obligations under
this Agreement or the APW 401(k) Plan or the Buyer 401(k) Plan and cooperate
with each other (and cause the trustees of the APW 401(k) Plan and the Buyer
401(k) Plan to cooperate with each other) to effectuate the transfer to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan of the Transferred Assets.   (e) Immediately prior to, and
subject to the Closing, API shall cause a "spin-off" of the assets and
liabilities of the API Section 125 Cafeteria Plan (which contains premium,
dependent care and medical health reimbursement component parts) (the "API
Flex Plan") resulting in the division of the API Flex Plan into two separate,
identical, component plans and trusts, in accordance with applicable law,
covering, respectively (i) Company employees (and their beneficiaries)
employed on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Company Flex
Plan") and (ii) all other API Flex Plan participants (and
their beneficiaries). Immediately prior to, and subject to, the Closing, API
shall cause the Company Flex Plan to be transferred to the Company. Prior to
the Closing, API shall draft the appropriate documents in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, acting reasonably, and use its
commercially best efforts to take all actions necessary, to the extent
possible, to effectuate the intent of this Section 5.18.   (f)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.18(b) and (d), Buyer may elect,
at any time on or prior to the Closing, to have the provisions of Sections
5.18(b), (c) and (d) not apply and to permit any employee of the Business
employed on the Closing Date who has an account balance under the APW 401(k)
Plan (a "Participant") to rollover (whether by direct or indirect rollover,
as selected by such Participant) his or her "eligible rollover distribution"
(as defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the APW 401(k) Plan to
the Buyer 401(k) Plan. API and the Seller acknowledge that on and after the
Closing Date the account balances of employees of the Business shall be
distributable from the APW 401(k) Plan in accordance with Section
401(k)(10) of the Code. API and the Seller and the APW 401(k) Plan shall not
place any Participant\'s plan loan into default or declare a default with
respect to any plan loan so long as such Participant transfers his or her

amount of the claim.   (b) The Indemnified Party shall tender to the

which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 8, and the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right at its expense to assume the defense thereof using counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall

deems advisable or appropriate, and in such event the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for the amount of such
settlement or judgment and for any and all amounts recoverable pursuant to
Section 8.3 or Section 8.4, including all damages, costs and expenses
sustained or incurred by the Indemnified Party which result from, arise out
of or are incidental to the defense or settlement of such Third Party
Claim.   (d) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other
in connection with any Third Party Claim or other claim and provide each
other with access to relevant personnel, books, records and other information
in their possession.   (e) Notwithstanding Section 8.5(b) above, all claims
by Buyer as a result of or arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty in Section 3.22 of this Agreement, or made
pursuant to Section 8.3(c) of this Agreement, shall be promptly tendered to

against any parties hereto. Seller and API shall have the right, at their
cost and expense, to control the resolution, negotiation and defense of all

advisable or appropriate consistent with applicable Environmental Health and
Safety Laws. In such event, the Seller and API shall promptly reimburse
the Buyer for all costs and expenses incurred to correct the breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or otherwise resolve the claim
or any liabilities arising under Section 8.3(c).   51    8.6

any expected increase in premiums as a result of the payment of
such insurance claim) with respect to the claim giving rise to such
indemnification payments.   8.7 Exclusive Remedy. Buyer, Seller and API
agree that the indemnification provisions in this Article 8 and in Section
5.11(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer and API and
Seller with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries and the Subject
Transactions.   8.8 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification by reason of
a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty contained in Article 3
until the aggregate of such indemnification obligations of Seller and API
exceeds $2,500,000 (the "Minimum") in which event, Seller and API shall be
liable only for the amounts of such indemnification obligations in excess of
the Minimum. For purposes of computing the Minimum there shall be a
deductible of $17,500 for each separate claim for indemnification (the "Per
Claim Deductible"). The Per Claim Deductible shall not be includable in
computing the Minimum and Seller and API shall have no liability to Buyer for
any Per Claim Deductible hereunder. For purposes of determining if the
aggregate Losses exceed the Minimum, any payments made by Seller and API
under Sections 8.3(b) through 8.3(i) (except to the extent Section 8.3(i)

in computing the Minimum. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained herein the aggregate maximum indemnification liability of
Seller and API under this Article 8 shall not exceed $30,000,000, except that
any indemnification obligation for Taxes hereunder and any indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.3(g) or Section 8.3(h) or Section 8.3(i) (as it relates

TERMINATION; REMEDIES  ---------------------   9.1 Right to Terminate.

Agreement is terminated by Seller and API, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand (collectively referred to herein as the "Terminating Party") in
accordance with Section 9.1, the Terminating Party shall not have any claim
against the other party or parties (collectively "Other Party") except if the
circumstances giving rise to such termination are caused by or are a result
of a breach or inaccuracy of a representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation of the Other Party contained in this Agreement. If termination is
by reason of such a breach or inaccuracy, the Terminating Party shall be
entitled to such remedies as may be available to it in law or in equity. If
any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 of this Agreement have not been
satisfied, Buyer may nevertheless elect to proceed with consummation of the
Subject Transactions, and if any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 of
this Agreement have not been satisfied, Seller may nevertheless elect to
proceed with the consummation of the Subject Transactions. Any such election
to proceed shall be evidenced by a certificate signed by the electing party

by such electing party for nonfulfillment of such conditions.    ARTICLE

This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented only by written
agreement of the parties hereto at any time prior to or at the Closing with
respect to any of the terms contained herein.   10. Waiver and Compliance.
Any failure of Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller and API, on the other, to
comply with any obligation, covenant or agreement herein may be expressly
waived in writing by Seller and API or Buyer, respectively, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant or
agreement shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.   10. Expenses. Whether or not the Subject
Transactions are consummated, and except as may otherwise be expressly

and professional advisors incurred by the Company (prior to Closing), Seller
