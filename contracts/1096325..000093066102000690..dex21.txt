vi    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This Agreement and Plan of Merger
(this "Agreement") is made and  --------- entered into as of the 10th day of
March, 2002, by and among Intersil Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Echo Acquisition, Inc., a  ------ Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and  ---------- Elantec
Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").  ------- 
BACKGROUND   A. The Board of Directors of Parent has determined that
a combination with the Company is in the best interests of its
stockholders.   B The Board of Directors of the Company has determined
that a combination with Parent is in the best interests of its
stockholders.   C. In effectuation of the foregoing, the respective Boards 
of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and
declared advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders
the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as
the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the 
------ conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL").  ----   D.
Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s and the Company\'s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and officers of the Company
and Parent is entering into a Voting Agreement in the forms attached as
Exhibits A-1 and A-2, respectively (the "Voting Agreements"). 
-------------------- -----------------   E. The parties intend that the
Merger constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  ----   F. The
parties intend that the Merger be accounted for as a purchase transaction for
financial accounting purposes.   TERMS   In consideration of the foregoing
and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  
THE MERGER   1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions 
---------- hereof, and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2(a)), the Company shall be merged
with and into Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, the   separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving 
--------- Corporation"). -----------   1.2. Effective Time; Closing. (a)
Concurrently with the Closing  ----------------------- (as defined in
Section 1.2(b)), the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary
of State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate  ------------------
----------- of Merger") in accordance with Section 251 of the
DGCL. --------- The Merger shall become effective (the "Effective Time")
when the Certificate  -------------- of Merger has been filed with the
Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by the
parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger.   (b) The closing of
the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall be held at the
offices of Dechert, 4675 MacArthur Court,  ------- Suite 1400, Newport
Beach, California, at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second business day
following the date on which the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have
been satisfied or waived, or at such other place or time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may agree. The date on which the Closing takes
place is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."  -------------   1.3.
Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the 
--------------------- Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL.   1.4. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective
Time,  --------------------------------------- the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except that as of the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to change
the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Elantec Semiconductor, Inc."  
1.5. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The 
--------------------------------------------------- directors and corporate
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors and corporate officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time.   1.6. Structure of Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent  ------------------------ may elect,
by written notice delivered to the Company, and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, that instead of merging the Company into Merger Sub, Merger
Sub or another direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent shall merge with and
into the Company, with the effects set forth in the DGCL; provided 
-------- that no material delay or adverse effect (including on the treatment
of the Merger as a "reorganization" under the Code) to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby results from the making of such
election. In such event, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation and shall
continue under the name "Elantec Semiconductor, Inc.," and references in this
Agreement to the "Merger" shall refer to the reverse merger described in this
Section 1.6. None of the Company\'s, Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s
representations, warranties or covenants shall be affected by whether the
Company or Merger Sub is the Surviving Corporation in the Merger.   2   
ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   2.1. Conversion of Capital Stock.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of  --------------------------- the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
their respective stockholders:   (a) Subject to the other provisions of this
Article II, each share of Company Common Stock (as defined in Section 3.4)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
and Dissenting Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.4)), including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement  ------ dated as of September 14, 1998 between the
Company and Mellon Investor Services, LLC (the "Rights Agreement"), shall be
converted into and represent  ---------------- the right to receive (i) 1.24
(the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent Class A  -------------- Common Stock
(as defined in Section 4.4) (the "Stock Consideration") and (ii) 
------------------- $8.00 in cash without interest (the "Cash Consideration,"
and together with  ------------------ the Stock Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration"). Subject to the other  -------------------- provisions of
this Article II, as of the Effective Time, each such share of Company Common
Stock shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be
cancelled and retired, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) certain dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.3(c) and (iii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.2(a), without interest.   (b) Each share of capital stock of the Company
held in the treasury of the Company shall be cancelled and retired and no
Merger Consideration or any other payment shall be made in respect
thereof.   (c) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger
Sub shall remain outstanding and shall represent capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time; provided, that if, 
-------- pursuant to Section 1.6, the Company is the Surviving Corporation in
the Merger, then each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger
Sub shall be converted into one issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.   2.2.
Fractional Shares; Adjustments. (a) No fractional shares of 
------------------------------ Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued as
a result of the conversion provided for in Section 2.1(a). In lieu of any
such fractional shares, the holder of a certificate previously evidencing
Company Common Stock, upon presentation of such fractional interest
represented by an appropriate certificate for Company Common Stock to the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.3) pursuant to Section 2.3, shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment therefor in an amount equal to the value
(determined with reference to the closing price of a share of Parent Class A
Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market on the last full trading
day immediately prior to the Closing Date) of such fractional interest. Such
payment with respect to fractional shares is   3   merely intended to
provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a separately bargained for,
consideration. If more than one certificate representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall be surrendered for the account of the same holder, the
number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock for which certificates have
been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of
shares represented by the certificates so surrendered. Any payment owed with
respect to fractional shares shall be rounded upward to the nearest cent.  
(b) If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall declare a stock dividend or
other similar distribution of Parent Class A Common Stock or securities
convertible into shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, or effect a stock
split, reclassification, recapitalization, stock combination or other change
with respect to the Parent Class A Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect such dividend, distribution, stock
split, reclassification, recapitalization, stock combination or other
change.   2.3. Exchange of Certificates.  ------------------------   (a)
Exchange Agent. Promptly following the Effective Time, 
-------------- Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
EquiServe LLC or such other exchange agent as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the  -------------- holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 2.3, certificates representing shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and cash in an amount required to
be paid pursuant to this Article II (such shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 
-------------   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the 
------------------- Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
("Certificates"), (i) a letter of  ------------ transmittal in customary
form, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, including offering holders
of Certificates the ability to hold their shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock in book entry form in lieu of the certificates provided for below and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate or
certificates representing that whole number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(a) in such denominations and registered in such names as such holder may
request and (y) a check representing the amount of Cash Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, after deduction of any required
withholding tax. No interest will be paid or accrued on the
Cash Consideration or the cash in lieu of   4   fractional shares, if
any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered on the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, together with a check for the Cash
Consideration plus cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued to such transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock held by
such transferee is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (c) Distributions with
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. 
------------------------------------------------ Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no dividend or other distribution declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect to any shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock having a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no Merger Consideration or
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder,
until the holder shall surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section
2.3. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.9),
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of surrender of such Certificate, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may
be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to
surrender of such Certificate, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding
taxes that may be required thereon.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in
Company Common Stock. 
--------------------------------------------------- The Merger Consideration
paid upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.3. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any
person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received written  -------------- undertakings from such person in
the form attached as Exhibit B.  ---------   (e) Termination of Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the  ---------------------------- Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Company Common Stock 180 days after the
date of the mailing required by Section 2.3(b) shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand therefor, and holders of Certificates previously representing
shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section   5   2.2(a), or any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c), in each case, without any interest
thereon.   (f) No Liability. Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation 
------------ nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect
of any shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years
after the Effective Time of the Merger (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.5)), any
such shares, dividends or distributions or cash in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.   (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Agent shall  --------------------------- invest the cash included
in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.3(e).   (h) Missing
Certificates. In the event any Certificate  -------------------- shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
and providing an appropriate indemnity or surety bond by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
other distributions, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.   2.4. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of
this  ----------------- Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent
required by the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto (the "Dissenting Common Stock") in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,  ----------------------- shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and each
holder of such shares of Dissenting Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares of Dissenting Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise loses his,
her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after
the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws
or loses such right, such shares of Dissenting Common Stock shall thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable
for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Dissenting
Common Stock. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals or
offer to settle or settle any such demands, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands.   6    2.5. Treatment of Stock Options; ESPP. (a) Prior to the
Effective  -------------------------------- Time, the Company shall take all
such actions as may be necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised
option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option")
outstanding as of the Effective Time to be automatically 
-------------- converted at the Effective Time into an option (a "Converted
Option") to  ---------------- purchase that number of shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
immediately prior to the Effective Time upon exercise of the Company Option
(without regard to actual restrictions on exercisability) multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio (with the number of shares rounded down to the nearest
whole share), with an exercise price equal to the exercise price which
existed under the corresponding Company Option divided by the Option Exchange
Ratio (with the exercise price rounded up to the nearest whole cent), and
with other terms and conditions that are the same as the terms and conditions
of such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time. "Option
Exchange Ratio" means  --------------------- the sum of (x) the Exchange
Ratio plus (y) the quotient of (A) $8.00 divided by (B) the closing price of
a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the
last full trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date, rounded to the
nearest third decimal place. In connection with the issuance of Converted
Options, Parent shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock that will become subject to Converted Options pursuant
to this Section 2.5 and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, upon exercise
of Converted Options, make available for issuance all shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock covered thereby, subject to the terms and conditions
applicable thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Option that
was subject to Section 422 of the Code immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be substituted with a Converted Option in accordance with Section
424 of the Code. Holders of a Company Option shall be credited with service
for purposes of vesting in the Converted Option to the same extent such
holders were credited with service for purposes of vesting in the Company
Option immediately prior to Closing.   (b) Parent agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") within five business  ---------- days after the Closing Date a
registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form under the
Securities Act to register the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Converted Options and use its reasonable efforts to
cause such registration statement to remain effective until the exercise or

Purchase Plan (the -------------- "Company 423 Plan") shall be assumed by
Parent. The Assumed Purchase Rights  ---------------- shall continue to

issuable upon exercise thereof multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio and
the purchase price of such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock on the
Purchase Date (as defined in the Company 423 Plan) shall be the lower of (i)
the quotient determined by dividing 85% of the fair market value per share of
the Company Common Stock on the commencement date of the Assumed Purchase
Right by the Option Exchange Ratio or (ii) 85% of the fair market value per
share of the Parent Class A Common Stock on the applicable Purchase Date

the foregoing, any assumed Purchase Right shall be converted from a right
to purchase Company Common Stock under the Company 423 Plan to the right
to purchase Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 424 of
the Code. The Assumed Purchase Rights shall be exercised on the
applicable Purchase Date, and each participant shall, accordingly, be issued
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock at such time. The Company 423 Plan and
all outstanding purchase rights thereunder shall terminate on the last day of
any Offering Period (as defined in the Company 423 Plan) in effect on the
date hereof, and no additional purchase rights shall be granted and no
additional Offering Periods shall commence following the date hereof. Parent

in the Company 423 Plan.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case
to the extent that any such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising,
existing or occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, regardless of
whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the full extent permitted under the DGCL, the Company Certificate or
the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement in effect prior to the
date hereof and listed in Section 5.2(c) to the Company Disclosure Schedule
(complete and correct copies of which have been previously provided to

any Claim, after the Effective Time, Parent shall periodically advance to
such Indemnified Person its legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject
to the provisions of paragraph (ii) of this Section 5.2(c), and subject to
the providing by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to reimburse all
amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
thereto.   (ii) The Indemnified Person shall control the defense of any
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent, provided that Parent shall be permitted
to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense. Parent shall
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
all Indemnified Persons in any single Claim except to the extent that, in
the opinion   35   of independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent,
representation of two or more of such Indemnified Persons would present a
conflict of interest under applicable standards of conduct in the legal
profession. Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.  
(iii) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification of
liabilities, and all limitations with respect thereto, existing in favor of
any Indemnified Person, as provided in the Company Certificate or the Company
Bylaws and any indemnification agreement in effect at the date hereof and
listed in Section 5.2(c) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment
thereto; provided, however, that in the event any Claim  ---------
------- is asserted or made, any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Person\'s conduct complies with the
standards set forth under the DGCL, the Company Certificate or the Company
Bylaws or any such agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by
independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Person and reasonably
acceptable to Parent; and provided further that nothing in this Section
5.2(c) shall impair any rights or -------- ------- obligations of any
current or former director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries,
including pursuant to the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws
of Parent or the Company, or their respective subsidiaries, under the DGCL or
otherwise.   (iv) Parent shall maintain the Company\'s existing directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance policy ("DandO; Insurance") for a 
------------- period of not less than six years after the Effective Time;
provided, however,  ----------------- that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts (with carriers
comparable to the Company\'s existing carriers) containing terms no less
advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further that if
the existing DandO; Insurance expires or is canceled -------- ------- during
such period, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain substantially
similar DandO; Insurance; provided further that Parent shall not be  --------
------- required to pay an aggregate premium for DandO; Insurance in excess of
$1.75 million, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible
for such amount.   (v) The provisions of this Section 5.2(c) are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her personal
representatives.   (vi) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
(A) provide to the directors of the Company who become directors of
Parent directors\' and officers\' liability insurance on the same basis and
to the same extent as that, if any, provided to other directors of Parent,
and (B) enter into indemnification agreements with the directors of the
Company who become directors of Parent on the same terms, if any, entered
into with other directors of Parent generally.   (d) Parent Board of
Directors and Officers; Integration and 
------------------------------------------------------- Transition. Parent
shall take all requisite action to cause its Board of ---------- Directors
to include as members thereof effective at the Effective Time, (i) the Chief
Executive Officer of Parent at the Effective Time as provided in paragraph
(e) below and (ii) James V. Diller.   36    (e) Chief Executive Officer
of Parent. Parent shall take all 
--------------------------------- requisite action (i) to appoint Richard M.
Beyer to serve, effective at the Effective Time and at the discretion of the
Board of Directors of Parent, as the Chief Executive Officer of Parent, and
(ii) to appoint Gregory L. Williams to serve, effective at the Effective Time
at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Parent, as the Executive
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Parent.   (f) Nasdaq Listing. Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts to  -------------- cause the shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger (including,
without limitation, the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of the Converted Options) to be approved for listing on the
Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.   (g) Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall give
prompt  ------------------------------- notice to the Company of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would likely cause any Parent representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time
in any material respect and (ii) any material failure of Parent to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section -------- ------- 5.2(g) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Company.   (h)
Employees and Employee Benefits. As soon as practicable 
------------------------------- after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall confer and work together in good faith to agree upon
mutually acceptable employee benefit and compensation arrangements. From and
after the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.5, Parent
shall treat all service for vesting and eligibility purposes by the Company
Employees (as defined below) with the Company and their respective
predecessors prior to the Effective Time, to the extent credited under the
terms of the Company Plans prior to the Effective Time, as service with
Parent for eligibility and vesting purposes under Parent\'s employee benefits
plans. With respect to any medical or dental benefit plan in which the
Company Employees participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements (provided,  -------- however,
that no such waiver shall apply to a pre-existing condition of
any ------- Company Employee who was, as of the Effective Time, treated
under a Company Plan as a pre-existing condition), and shall provide that any
covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time by a Company
Employee or a Company Employee\'s covered dependent shall be taken into
account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Effective Time to the same extent
as such expenses are taken into account for the benefit of similarly situated
employees of Parent and subsidiaries of Parent. For purposes of this Section
5.2(i), "Company  ------- Employees" shall mean persons who are, as of the
Effective Time, employees of --------- the Company.   (i) Prohibition on
Certain Transactions. Prior to the date of 
----------------------------------- the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent
shall not enter into a definitive agreement, or publicly announce an
intention to enter into a definitive agreement, with respect to any
acquisition, disposition, merger or other business combination involving
Parent or any of its subsidiaries, if (x) in order to   37   consummate
such transaction, the approval by the holders of Parent Class A Common Stock
shall be required or (y) such transaction presents a material risk of making
it materially more difficult to obtain any approval or authorization required
to consummate the Merger under Antitrust Laws.   5.3. Covenants of the
Company.  ------------------------   (a) The Company Stockholders Meeting.
The Company shall take  -------------------------------- all action in
accordance with the federal securities laws, the DGCL and the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws necessary to convene a special meeting of
the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote (the "Company 
------- Stockholders Meeting") to be held and completed on the earliest
practicable date -------------------- following the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and mutually determined by the parties (which date
shall be the same date as the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting or as
close to one another as reasonably practicable), to consider and vote upon
approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to Section 5.3(d), neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose
or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3(a) shall
limit the Company\'s obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders
Meeting (regardless of whether the Company Board Recommendation shall have
been withdrawn, amended or modified).   (b) Joint Proxy Statement;
Registration Statement. The Company 
--------------------------------------------- shall cooperate with Parent in
the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement in a timely fashion
and shall use all reasonable efforts to assist Parent in having the
Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission as promptly as
practicable and in maintaining the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement through the Effective Time. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall obtain knowledge of any information pertaining to the
Company that would require any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, the Company shall so advise Parent in
writing and shall promptly furnish Parent with all information as shall be
required for such amendment or supplement and shall promptly take such action
as shall be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement and/or
Joint Proxy Statement. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to mail
at the earliest practicable date to the stockholders of the Company the Joint
Proxy Statement, which shall include all information required under
Applicable Laws to be furnished to the stockholders of the Company
in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby and
shall include the written opinion of Robertson Stephens described in Section
3.23 and the Company Board Recommendation to the extent not previously
withdrawn in compliance with Section 5.3(d).   (c) Conduct of the
Company\'s Operations. During the period from 
----------------------------------- the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to conduct its
operations in the ordinary course, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall use all
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and to
retain the services of its officers and key employees and use all reasonable
efforts to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, lessees,
licensees and   38   other third parties with the intent that its
goodwill and ongoing business shall not be impaired in any material respect.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from the
date of this Agreement to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or as
set forth in Section 5.3(c) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, without the
prior written consent of Parent:   (i) do or effect any of the following
actions with respect to its securities: (A) adjust, split, combine or

stock, other than the rights or options granted to newly hired or promoted

market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant, (D) issue,
deliver or sell or agree to issue, deliver or sell any additional shares of
its capital stock or any other securities or obligations convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock or such

outstanding as of the date hereof or which are granted by the Company prior
to the Effective Time in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, (2) the
Company 423 Plan in accordance with Section 2.5, or (3) the Company\'s 401(k)
plan as in effect on the date hereof) or (E) enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement with respect to the sale, voting, registration

Company and a Governmental Authority;   (x) amend, terminate or modify any
Contract listed in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or enter
into any Contract that, if it were in effect as of the date hereof, would be

(xi) enter into any confidentiality, standstill or non-compete agreements or

term of this  --------------- Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its
subsidiaries\' directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives,
directly or indirectly, to (A) solicit, initiate, intentionally encourage or
facilitate, or furnish or disclose non-public information in furtherance of,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any
recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company, or acquisition of any capital stock from the Company
(other than upon exercise of Company Options that are outstanding as of the
date hereof or that are granted in accordance with this Agreement) or 15% or
more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
in a single transaction or a series of transactions, or any acquisition by
the Company of any material assets or capital stock of any other person, or
any combination of the foregoing (a "Competing  ---------  
40   Transaction"), or (B) negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions
with any ----------- person (other than Parent or its respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) with respect to any
Competing Transaction or (C) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that, at any time before the approval  -------- of the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, the Company may
furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions
with, any person who delivers a bona fide written proposal for a Competing
Transaction  ---- ---- that was not solicited or intentionally encouraged
after the date of this Agreement if and to the extent the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action
would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company under Applicable Laws and determines that such proposal for
the Competing Transaction is, if accepted, reasonably likely to be
consummated and is, after consulting with Robertson Stephens (or any other
nationally recognized investment banking firm), more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and
conditions proposed by Parent in response to such Competing Transaction) (a
"Superior Proposal"); provided, further, that the  -----------------
--------- ------- Company notifies Parent not less than two business days
prior to taking such action (which notice shall identify the person making
the proposal and describe the terms thereof) and receives from the person
making the proposal an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably
customary form and in any event containing terms at least as restrictive on
the other person as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.3(f)) are to Parent. The Company shall notify Parent of any
proposal for a Competing Transaction (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the person making it) as promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) after its receipt thereof,
and shall thereafter inform Parent on a prompt basis of the status of any
discussion or negotiations with such third party and any material changes to
the terms and conditions of such proposal, and shall promptly give Parent a
copy of any information delivered to such person that has not previously been
reviewed by Parent. The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause its
and its subsidiaries\' respective officers, directors and representatives to
cease, all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal for a Competing
Transaction.   (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5.3(d), in the event that before the approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board of Directors under Applicable Laws, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following sentences)
withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation and (if the reason for the change in the Company Board
Recommendation is the existence of a Superior Proposal) take and disclose to
the stockholders of the Company a position with respect to such Superior
Proposal by disclosing such withdrawn, amended or modified Company Board
Recommendation and, to the extent applicable, a recommendation with respect
to such Superior Proposal in connection with a tender or exchange offer for
the Company securities; provided that the Company  -------- has complied
with its obligations under this Section 5.3(d) and it gives Parent two
business days prior written notice of   41   its intention to do so.
Consistent with the terms of this Section 5.3(d), the Company may take any
action to the extent necessary in order to comply with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company Board of Directors shall not,
in connection with any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
Company Board Recommendation, take any action to change the approval of the
Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other state law to be applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, including this Agreement and the Merger. If the reason for the change
in the Company Board Recommendation is the Company\'s receipt of a proposal
for a Competing Transaction that it has determined to be a Superior Proposal,
and within such two business day period, Parent proposes in writing to modify
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall determine in good faith whether such terms as modified by Parent are at
least as favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of
view as such Superior Proposal, and if the Company\'s Board of Directors
determines that such terms as modified are at least as favorable as such
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may not
withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Board Recommendation.   (e) Affiliates of the Company. The Company shall
use all  ------------------------- reasonable efforts to cause each person
listed in Section 5.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and each
additional person, if any, who may be at the Effective Time an "affiliate" of
the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act to execute and
deliver to Parent no less than 30 days prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the written undertakings in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Company Affiliate Letter"). The  ---------
------------------------ foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be entitled
to place legends as specified in the Company Affiliate Letter on the
certificates evidencing any of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to
be received by (i) any such "affiliate" of the Company specified in such
letter or (ii) any person Parent reasonably identifies (by written notice to
the Company) as being a person who may be deemed an "affiliate" for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, consistent with
the terms of the Company Affiliate Letter, regardless of whether such person
has executed the Company Affiliate Letter and regardless of whether such
person\'s name appears on the letter to be delivered pursuant to the
preceding sentence.   (f) Access. The Company shall permit representatives
of Parent  ------ to have full access at all reasonable times to the
Company\'s premises, properties, books, records, contracts, documents,
customers and suppliers, and shall cause its independent accountants to give
Parent access to such accountants\' work papers. Information obtained by
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) shall be subject to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement by and between Parent and the Company, dated as
of June 14, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which agreement remains
in full force and  ------------------------- effect. No investigation
conducted pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to
provide Parent with information if the Company determines in good faith, upon
written advice of its outside antitrust counsel, that providing information
may violate any Applicable Laws.   42    (g) Notification of Certain
Matters. The Company shall give  ------------------------------- prompt
notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would likely cause any
representation or warranty by the Company contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time in any material
respect and (ii) any material failure of the Company to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section ----------------- 5.3(g) shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to Parent.   (h) Subsequent Financial
Statements. The Company shall provide  ------------------------------- to
Parent, sufficiently in advance so as to permit a reasonable period of
time to review and discuss the contents thereof, its financial results for
any period after the date of this Agreement prior to making such results
publicly available and prior to filing any Company SEC Documents after the
date of this Agreement, it being understood that Parent shall have no
liability by reason of such review and discussion.   (i) Letters of the
Company\'s Accountants. The Company shall use 
------------------------------------ all reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Parent letters of the Company\'s independent accountants, dated
a date within two business days before the date on which the Registration
Statement shall become effective, the date the Joint Proxy Statement is
mailed and the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Registration Statement.   (j) No Redemption of
Rights Plan. Between the date of this 
---------------------------- Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not (a) redeem,
amend or waive any provisions of the Rights Plan (other than such amendments
as are necessary to accommodate this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, but not with respect to any Competing Transaction) or
(b) implement or adopt any other so-called "poison pill," shareholder rights
plan or other similar plan.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS   6.1. Conditions

------------------------------------------- Company, Merger Sub and Parent to

waiting periods (and any extensions thereof, including any written commitment
to an HSR Authority to defer or delay consummation of the Merger
notwithstanding expiration of such waiting periods) under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Antitrust Laws relating to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or been terminated.   (c)

of their respective subsidiaries of, or to compel Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold
separate, any portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective subsidiaries, as a result of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) seeking to
prohibit Parent or any subsidiary of Parent from effectively controlling the
business or operations of the Company or the subsidiaries of the Company.  
(e) The Commission shall have declared the Registration Statement effective
under the Securities Act, and no stop order or similar restraining order

effect as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except for such
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of

of the representations and warranties in the aggregate to be true and correct
in all respects would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (b)

made on and as of the Closing Date (except for such representations and
warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which will be
determined as of the specified date), except for changes permitted by Section

to the Company a termination fee equal to $10 million and shall pay to the
Company an amount equal to the Company\'s reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (e) Provided that Parent has not committed an act with
the intent and effect of breaching this Agreement, the fee and expense
arrangements contemplated hereby are the sole remedies for breach of
Parent\'s obligations under Section 5.2(a) (other than equitable or
injunctive relief under Section 8.8) and shall constitute complete and
reasonable liquidated damages for any such breach. The amounts payable by
Parent pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be paid pursuant to this Section
7.3 regardless of any alleged breach, other than a willful or intentional
breach, by the Company of its obligations hereunder; provided, that no
payment made by Parent pursuant to this Section  -------- 7.3 shall operate
or be construed as a waiver by Parent of any breach of this Agreement by the
Company or, except as set forth herein, of any rights of Parent in respect
thereof.   (f) Any payment required to be made pursuant to paragraph (d) of
this Section 7.3 shall be made to the Company not later than two

When a reference is made in this  --------------------------- Agreement to

Agreement.   (b) For the purposes of any provision of this Agreement,
a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any party shall be deemed to
occur if  ----------------------- any event, change or effect, individually
or in the aggregate with such other events, changes or effects, has occurred
which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, assets   51   (including intangible assets), liabilities
(contingent or otherwise), prospects, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the
ability of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that a  -------- ------- Material Adverse
Effect shall not include any change in or effect upon the business, assets
(including intangible assets), liabilities (contingent or otherwise),
prospects, results of operations or financial condition of such party or any
of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly arising out of or attributable to
(x) any decrease in the market price of the shares of Company Common Stock in
the case of the Company or Parent Class A Common Stock in the case of Parent
(but not any change or effect underlying such decrease to the extent such
change or effect would otherwise constitute a Material Adverse Effect on such
party) or (y) conditions, events, or circumstances generally affecting the
economy as a whole or the semiconductor industry generally. For purposes of
analyzing whether any state of facts, change, development, effect, condition
or occurrence constitutes a Material Adverse Effect under this definition,
the parties agree that (A) materiality shall be analyzed from the viewpoint
of whether there is a significant likelihood that the disclosure of such
state of facts, change, development, effect, condition or occurrence would be
viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix
of information available to such investor if the total mix consisted
solely of (I) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
(other than Section 3.6 in the case of the Company and Section 4.6 in the
case of Parent), (II) the Company SEC Documents or the Parent SEC Documents,
as the case may be, and (III) the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, and (B) the analysis of
materiality shall not be limited to the standpoint of a long-term
investor.   (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a "subsidiary" of any 
---------- person means another person, an amount of the voting securities or
other voting ownership or voting partnership interests (or, in the case of a
trust, beneficial interests) of which is sufficient to elect at least a
majority of its Board of Directors or other governing body (or, if there are
no such voting securities or interests, 50% or more of the equity interests
of which is owned directly or indirectly by such first person).   (d) For
purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge" of a party  --------- shall mean the
actual knowledge after due inquiry of all elected officers of such party or
any of its subsidiaries with a title of vice president or higher.   (e) For
purposes of this Agreement, references to any financial statements or any
component thereof shall be deemed to include the footnotes thereto.   (f)
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "including" shall  --------- mean
"including, without limitation."  ---------   8.4. Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which  ------------ together
shall constitute one and the same Agreement. The parties may execute more
than one copy of the Agreement, each of which shall constitute an
original.   8.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
and the  ---------------- instruments referred to herein), the Voting
Agreements, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire
agreement among the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings,   52   agreements or representations by or among the
parties, written and oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.   8.6. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the agreement set
forth in  ------------------------- Section 5.2(c), nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to create
any third party beneficiaries.   8.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be
governed by the laws of the  ------------- State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Each party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States
of America, in each case located in the State of Delaware, for any action
(and agrees not to commence any action except in any such court), and further
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to its respective address set forth in Section 8.2 shall
be effective service of process for any action brought against it in any
such court. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action in the courts of the State of
Delaware or of the United States of America, in each case located in the
State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives
and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any action brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.   8.8. Specific
Performance. The transactions contemplated by this 
-------------------- Agreement are unique. Accordingly, each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it
may be entitled, each of the parties hereto is entitled to a decree of
specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief, and the
parties hereto agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining thereof.   8.9. Assignment.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests  ---------- or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties; provided, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of Merger 
-------- Sub\'s rights and obligation under this Agreement to any other

advised that as of the date of this letter the undersigned may be deemed to
be an "affiliate" of Elantec Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)

of Parent Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Parent (the
"Parent Securities") in exchange for shares owned by the undersigned of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (or upon the exercise
of options or warrants for such shares, or upon a distribution, if any, from
the Company 423 Plan or the Company\'s 401(k) plan).   The undersigned
hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that in the event the
undersigned receives any Parent Securities as a result of the Merger:   A.
The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other  disposition of
the Parent Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules  and Regulations
of the Commission.   B. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and
the Merger  Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and
other  applicable limitations upon his, her or its ability to sell, transfer
or  otherwise dispose of the Parent Securities, to the extent the
undersigned  felt necessary, with his, her or its counsel or counsel for
Parent.   C. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent 
Securities to him, her or it pursuant to the Merger has been or will be 
registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on 
Form S-4. However, the undersigned has also been advised that, since at the 
time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the    stockholders of the
Company, (i) the undersigned may be deemed to have been  an affiliate of the
Company and (ii) the distribution by the undersigned of  the Parent
Securities has not been registered under the Act, the  undersigned may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Parent  Securities issued to
undersigned in the Merger unless (x) such sale,  transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Act, (y) such  sale, transfer or
other disposition is made in conformity with Rule 145 (as  such rule may be
hereafter from time to time amended) promulgated by the  Commission under the
Act, or (z) in the opinion of counsel reasonably  acceptable to Parent, or a
"no action" letter obtained by the undersigned  from the staff of the
Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition  is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act.   D. The undersigned understands that
Parent is under no obligation to  Stockholder to register the sale, transfer
or other disposition of the  Parent Securities by the undersigned or on his,
her or its behalf under the  Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with  an exemption from such registration
available.   E. The undersigned also understands that stop transfer
instructions  will be given to Parent\'s transfer agents with respect to the
Parent  Securities and that there will be placed on the certificates for the
Parent  Securities issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor,
a  legend stating in substance:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT  OF 1933 APPLIES, AND MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED IN  COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR PURSUANT TO
A  REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THAT ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH 
REGISTRATION."   F. The undersigned also understands that unless the
transfer by the  undersigned of his, her or its Parent Securities has been
registered under  the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions
of Rule 145,  Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the
certificates  issued to the undersigned\'s transferee:   "THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE SECURITIES LAWS  OF ANY STATE, AND WERE
ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH  SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH
RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES
HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY  THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN
CONNECTION WITH,  ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
SECURITIES ACT  OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED  EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN   -2-    EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT  OF 1933."   It is
understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs F and G above
shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend
if such legend is not required for purposes of the Act or this Agreement. It
is understood and agreed that such legends and the stop orders referred to
above will be removed if (i) evidence or representations satisfactory to
Parent that the Parent Securities represented by such certificates are being
or have been sold in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145(d) (as such rule may be hereafter from time to time amended) or (ii)
Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no action" letter obtained
by the undersigned from the staff of the Commission, to the effect that the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to the
undersigned.   Execution of this letter is not and should not be considered
an admission on the part of the undersigned that he, she or it is an
"affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this
letter, or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to
any claim that he, she or it is such an affiliate on or after the date of
this letter.   Very truly yours,   ____________________  Name:
