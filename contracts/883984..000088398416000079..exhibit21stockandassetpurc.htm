Section 2.3 Consents.



a.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement and
the Local Implementing Agreements shall not constitute the sale, conveyance,
assignment, assumption, transfer or delivery, direct or indirect, of any
interest in any Purchased Asset or asset of any Conveyed Subsidiary (or any
Subsidiary thereof) or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom if such sale, conveyance, assignment, assumption, transfer
or delivery, without the consent or approval of any Person (including consents
or approvals of any Governmental Authorities but excluding consents or
approvals from the Sellers) or the notification, information and/or
consultation with any employee representatives, works councils or health and
safety committees, when such notification, information and/or consultation is
required or otherwise, (i) would constitute a breach or other contravention of
the rights of such Person, (ii) would be ineffective under, or contravene,
applicable Law or (iii) would in any way materially and adversely affect the
contractual rights of the Sellers, or upon transfer, Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Designated Affiliate; provided, however, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, the Parties shall treat Purchaser and the
Purchaser Designated Affiliates, as the case may be, as the owner of such
Purchased Asset or asset of such Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof)
as of the Closing Date for all purposes (including Tax purposes). In such
case, the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of such interest,
asset, claim, right or benefit shall be effective once the applicable consents
are obtained, notifications are made or employee representatives, works
councils or health and safety committees have been duly notified, informed
and/or consulted under applicable local Law.



b.If any such consent, notification or approval referred to in Section 2.3(a)
is not obtained prior to the Closing (for the avoidance of doubt, other than
the consents or approvals set forth in Annex C hereto, the receipt of which
shall remain a condition to the Closing), the Closing shall nonetheless take
place, and thereafter each of the Sellers and Purchaser and the Purchaser
Designated Affiliates will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary consents or approvals for such sale, conveyance, assignment,
assumption, transfer or delivery thereof, and (ii) cooperate, upon written
request of Purchaser, in endeavoring to obtain for Purchaser and the
applicable Purchaser Designated Affiliates (50% of any such costs shall be
borne or reimbursed by Purchaser), an arrangement (including subleasing,
sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide for Purchaser or such Purchaser
Designated Affiliates substantially equivalent economic and operational
claims, rights and benefits and 

liabilities of use thereof (subject, however, to the express provision of cost
bearing by any Seller under any of the Ancillary Agreements), and the Sellers
shall continue to perform their obligations and comply with the terms
thereunder, upon the direction of Purchaser, in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and taking into
account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that, to
the extent, and only to the extent, Purchaser is able to receive substantially
equivalent economic and operational claims, rights and benefits under any such
arrangement and underlying Purchased Asset or asset of a Conveyed Subsidiary
(or any Subsidiary thereof), Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers in respect
of all third-party Liabilities of the Sellers in respect of each such
arrangement and underlying Purchased Asset or asset of such Conveyed
Subsidiary thereof other than Liabilities arising out of the breach of this
Agreement by the Sellers, for which breach Seller Parent will indemnify
Purchaser and its Affiliates. Upon obtaining the requisite consents thereto,
such Purchased Asset or asset of such Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary
thereof), shall be promptly transferred and assigned to, and accepted and
assumed by, Purchaser and the applicable Purchaser Designated Affiliates
hereunder at no additional cost. Seller Parent shall hold in trust for and pay
to Purchaser as promptly as practicable upon receipt thereof, all income,
proceeds and other monies received by any Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.3. If the requisite
consents have not been received by the date that is one (1) year after the
Closing Date, Purchaser may, by delivery of written notice to Seller Parent,
request that the Parties expeditiously identify alternative means or
structures by which any remaining Purchased Assets (and/or the benefits
thereof) may be transferred to Purchaser, and Seller Parent shall effect such
transfer by such alternative means or structure that Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall have mutually agreed upon, to the extent such Purchased Assets
are legally transferable by such alternative means or structure. For the
avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Parties pursuant to Section 6.4
shall not be affected by this Section 2.3(b).

Designated Affiliates are not purchasing any of the following (the "Excluded
Assets"):

to the extent such assets are Purchased Assets) of the type currently provided

its sole cost and expense, such action as is necessary or advisable to
transfer, effective as of, or prior to, the Closing Date, the Excluded Assets
from the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries (and, if needed, from
the Asset Sellers) to Seller Parent or one or more of its Affiliates for such
consideration or for no consideration, as may be determined by Seller Parent
in its sole discretion, but in compliance with all applicable Laws and as
would not result in, solely by reason of the actions described in this Section
2.4(b), any impairment to the Purchased Assets or the Business other than any
immaterial impairment.



Section 2.5 Assumption of Certain Obligations of the Business. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser agrees, effective

applicable Sellers for the Final Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from all amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Law
related to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
paid over to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Purchaser shall
provide Seller Parent with three (3) days advance written notice of any such
Tax required to be deducted or withheld. Each Party hereby agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate the imposition of any withholding Taxes.
Purchaser shall also notify Seller Parent in writing at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing of any Share Reduction Amount.



Section 2.8 Payments at Closing. At the Closing, Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates shall pay to Seller Parent or Seller Parent's designee(s), on
behalf of the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Seller Account, the amount equal to: (a) the Cash Consideration, (b) either
plus the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Target
Working Capital or minus the amount by which the Target Working Capital
exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, as applicable, (c) plus Estimated Net
Cash (which may be a positive or negative number), (d) plus VAT due by
Purchaser under Section 6.6(i), (e) minus the excess, if any, of the amount of
Transfer Taxes paid by Purchaser over Purchaser's share of such Transfer Taxes
under Section 6.6(h), and (f) plus the excess, if any, of the amount of
Transfer Taxes paid by the Sellers over the Sellers' share of such Transfer
Taxes under Section 6.6(h) (the aggregate amount referred to in clauses (a)
through (f), collectively with the Share Consideration, the "Preliminary
Purchase Price"). The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be subject to the post-
Closing adjustment provisions of Section 2.10 and shall be allocated as
described in Section 2.11.



Section 2.9 Estimated Closing Statement. No fewer than three (3) Business Days
before the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser
the Estimated Closing Statement.



Section 2.10 Purchase Price Adjustment

.

a.Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller Parent a statement setting forth, without duplication of any items,
Purchaser's calculation as of 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date
of the Working Capital, the Net Cash, VAT due by Purchaser under Section
6.6(i), the amount of Transfer Taxes payable by the Sellers and by Purchaser,
the allocation of Transfer Taxes payable by the Sellers and by Purchaser under
Section 6.6(h), and reasonable supporting schedules for the foregoing (the
"Proposed Closing Statement"). The Proposed Closing Statement shall be
unaudited but shall be prepared in good faith and applying the Accounting
Principles, and on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Balance
Sheet Statement.



b.During the sixty (60)-day period ("Review Period") following Seller Parent's
receipt of the Proposed Closing Statement, (i) Seller Parent and its
Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business
hours to the working papers of Purchaser and its independent auditors used in
the preparation of the Proposed Closing Statement (provided, that Seller
Parent and its Representatives, including its independent auditors, have
executed all release letters reasonably requested by Purchaser's independent
auditors in connection therewith) and (ii) Seller Parent may dispute the
amounts reflected on the line items of the Proposed Closing Statement (a
"Disputed Item") on the basis that a Disputed Item does not reflect, or has
not been made in a manner consistent with, the provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however, Seller Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing of each
Disputed Item, and specify the amount thereof in dispute and the specific
basis therefor, within the Review Period. Any notice of Disputed Items shall
(i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted
(with reasonable supporting documentation) and (ii) specify the amount that
Seller Parent reasonably believes is the correct Working Capital or the Net
Cash, based on the disagreements set forth in the notice of Disputed Items,
including a reasonably detailed description of the adjustments applied to the
Proposed Closing Statement in calculating such amount. Seller Parent shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Proposed Closing Statement not so objected to in a notice of Disputed Items
within the Review Period, and the failure by Seller Parent to provide a notice
of Disputed Items to Purchaser within the Review Period will constitute Seller
Parent's acceptance of all of the items in the Proposed Closing Statement and
the Proposed Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties as the Final Closing Statement at the end of the Review Period.



c.If a notice of Disputed Items shall be timely delivered pursuant to Section
2.10(b), Seller Parent and Purchaser shall, during the forty-five (45) days
following the date of such delivery (the "Resolution Period"), negotiate in
good faith to resolve the Disputed Items. During the Resolution Period,
Purchaser and its Representatives (including its independent auditors) shall
be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to the working
papers of Seller Parent and its independent auditors relating to the notice of
Disputed Items (provided, that Purchaser and its Representatives, including
its independent auditors, have executed all release letters reasonably
requested 

by Seller Parent's independent auditors in connection therewith). To the
extent the Disputed Items are so resolved in writing within the Resolution
Period, then the Proposed Closing Statement, as revised to incorporate such
changes as have been agreed between Purchaser and Seller Parent, shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties as the Final Closing Statement.



d.If during such Resolution Period the Parties are unable to reach agreement,
Seller Parent and Purchaser shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to the
Independent Accountant. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountant
to make a determination with respect to each unresolved Disputed Item within
thirty (30) days after its engagement by Seller Parent and Purchaser to
resolve such Disputed Items, which determination shall be made in accordance
with the rules set forth in this Section 2.10. The Independent Accountant may
conduct such proceedings as the Independent Accountant believes, in its sole
discretion, will assist in the determination of the unresolved Disputed Items;
provided, however, that, except as Seller Parent and Purchaser may otherwise
agree, all communications between Seller Parent and Purchaser or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent Accountant,
on the other hand, will be in writing with copies simultaneously delivered to
the non-communicating Party. The Independent Accountant shall make its
determination solely (i) on the documentation submitted by, and presentations
(any such documentation or presentation must be provided to the other Party
prior to its submission or presentation to the Independent Accountant) made by
Seller Parent and Purchaser, (ii) on the definitions of Preliminary Purchase
Price, Working Capital, and Net Cash (and each of the defined terms used in
each of those terms) and (iii) in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountant to deliver to Seller
Parent and Purchaser, within such thirty (30)-day period, a written report
setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Proposed Closing Statement and
the calculations supporting such adjustments, and any such adjustments must be
within the range of values established for such Disputed Item in the Proposed
Closing Statement and the notice of Disputed Items delivered pursuant to
Section 2.10(b). Such report shall be final, binding on the Parties and
conclusive on Seller Parent and Purchaser, absent manifest errors, and
enforceable in a court of law, effective as of the date the Independent
Accountant's written determination is received by Seller Parent and Purchaser.
Seller Parent and Purchaser shall each pay one-half (1/2) of all the costs
incurred in connection with the engagement of the Independent Accountant. As
used herein, "Final Working Capital" means (A) if no notice of Disputed Items
with respect to the Working Capital is delivered by Seller Parent to Purchaser
within the Review Period, the Working Capital as shown in the Proposed Closing
Statement as prepared by Purchaser, or (B) if such a notice of Disputed Items
with respect to the Working Capital is delivered by Seller Parent, either (x)
the Working Capital as agreed to in writing by Seller Parent and Purchaser, or
(y) the Working Capital as shown in the Independent Accountant's calculation
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.10(d). As used herein, "Final Net Cash"
means (1) if no notice of Disputed Items with respect to the Net Cash is
delivered by Seller Parent to Purchaser within the Review Period, the Net Cash
as shown in the Proposed Closing Statement as prepared by Purchaser, or (2) if
such a notice of Disputed Items with respect to the Net Cash is delivered by
Seller Parent, either (x) the Net Cash as agreed to in writing by Seller
Parent and Purchaser, or (y) the Net Cash as shown in the Independent
Accountant's calculation delivered pursuant to this Section 2.10(d). Seller
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that they have discussed their past contacts,
if any, with the 

Independent Accountant, and that neither Party shall have the right to object
to the Independent Accountant's service in such role by reason of disclosed
past contacts and conflicts of interest. If, before the Independent Accountant
renders its determination with respect to the Disputed Items in accordance
with this Section 2.10(d), (I) Seller Parent notifies Purchaser of its
agreement with any items in the Proposed Closing Statement or (II) Purchaser
notifies Seller Parent of its agreement with any Disputed Items, then in each
case such items as so agreed will be conclusive and binding on the Parties
immediately upon such notice.



e.Until the date on which the Proposed Closing Statement shall become final
and binding on the Parties pursuant to Section 2.10(b) or Section 2.10(c), as
applicable, Purchaser agrees that following the Closing it shall preserve the
accounting books and records of the Business on which the Proposed Closing
Statement is to be based and shall not take any actions with respect to such
books and records that would obstruct, prevent or otherwise affect the
procedures or the results of the procedures set forth in this Section 2.10(e)
(including the Working Capital and the Net Cash). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made during such period in
any reserve or other account existing as of the date of the Historical
Financial Statements, except as a result of events occurring after the date of
the Historical Financial Statements and, in such event, only in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Business using the same accounting
principles, policies, procedures and methods (with consistent classifications,
judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies
used and applied by Seller Parent in the preparation of the Historical
Financial Statements).



f.Until the date on which the Proposed Closing Statement shall become final
and binding on the Parties pursuant to Section 2.10(c), Purchaser agrees that
following the Closing it shall afford and cause to be afforded to Seller
Parent and its Representatives, in connection with the Proposed Closing
Statement and any adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price contemplated by
this Section 2.10(f), access upon reasonable notice during normal business
hours to the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business and Purchaser's and its accountant's work papers (provided, that
Seller Parent and its Representatives, including its independent auditors,
have executed all release letters reasonably requested by Purchaser's
independent auditors in connection therewith) relevant to the preparation of
the Proposed Closing Statement and the adjustment contemplated by this Section
2.10(f), including any notice of Disputed Items, and shall provide Seller
Parent, upon Seller Parent's reasonable request and at its sole cost and
expense, with copies of any such books, contracts, records and work papers.



g.If the Final Working Capital Adjustment is positive, then Purchaser shall
pay to Seller Parent the amount equal to the Final Working Capital Adjustment.
If the Final Working Capital Adjustment is negative, then Seller Parent shall
pay to Purchaser the amount equal to the absolute value of the Final Working
Capital Adjustment. If the Final Net Cash Adjustment is positive, then
Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent the amount equal to the Final Net Cash
Adjustment. If the Final Net Cash Adjustment is negative, then Seller Parent
shall pay to Purchaser the amount equal to the absolute value of the Final Net
Cash Adjustment. Any payment due under this Section 2.10(g) shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in
writing by Seller Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, within five (5) days
after the date on which the Final Closing Statement becomes conclusive and
binding on the Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10,
and, if not paid within such period, shall bear interest at the Interest Rate.
All computations of interest shall be made 

in accordance with Section 10.10. Any payment due under this Section 2.10(g)
shall be offset and netted against any other payment to be made under this
Section 2.10(g), such that only a single payment is made between Seller and
Purchaser under this Section 2.10(g).



h.The "Final Purchase Price" shall be equal to (i) the Preliminary Purchase
Price, plus (ii) the Final Working Capital Adjustment as determined pursuant
to this Section 2.10 and plus (iii) the Final Net Cash Adjustment as
determined pursuant to this Section 2.10.



Section 2.11 Allocation of the Purchase Price.



a.Seller Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and Purchaser have
agreed to allocate the Preliminary Purchase Price, without any adjustments
contemplated in Section 2.8 in respect of VAT and Transfer Taxes, and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Assumed Liabilities, 41% to the United
States and 59% to the rest of the world (the "Preliminary Allocation"). Each
of the Seller and Purchaser acknowledges that the Preliminary Allocation was
done at arm's length based upon a good faith estimate of fair market values.



b.No fewer than thirty (30) days before the Closing Date, Seller Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates and in accordance with this Section
2.11(b), shall deliver to Purchaser (i) a schedule allocating the Preliminary
Purchase Price, without any adjustments contemplated in Section 2.8 in respect
of VAT and Transfer Taxes, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Assumed Liabilities among (x) the Purchased Assets to be sold by each Asset
Seller, and (y) the assets of any Conveyed Subsidiary (and Subsidiary thereof)
(the "Asset Allocation Schedule"); and (ii) a written appraisal prepared by
Ernst and Young supporting the values of the assets on the Asset Allocation
Schedule (the "Appraisal Report"), the costs and expenses of which shall be
borne equally by Seller Parent and Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Asset Allocation Schedule shall be limited to the specific assets and
liabilities described in the immediately preceding sentence, shall be
consistent in all respects with the Preliminary Allocation, shall be in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, and shall be agreed to by Purchaser and Seller Parent
on or before the Closing Date. Purchaser shall notify Seller Parent within ten
(10) days of receipt of the Asset Allocation Schedule and the Appraisal Report
of any objection Purchaser may have thereto. Unless Purchaser delivers a
notice of objection with respect to the Asset Allocation Schedule or the
Appraisal Report by the conclusion of such ten (10) day period, the Asset
Allocation Schedule and the Appraisal Report provided by Seller Parent to
Purchaser pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.11(b) shall become
final and binding upon the Parties. The Parties hereto agree to resolve any
disagreement with respect to the Asset Allocation Schedule and the Appraisal
Report in good faith. If a resolution of such disagreement has not been
effected within fifteen (15) days (or longer, as mutually agreed by the
Parties hereto) after delivery of an objection by Purchaser, then either Party
hereto may submit such agreement to the Independent Accountant for
determination. The determination of the Independent Accountant with respect to
any such disagreement shall be final and binding upon each Party hereto and
the decision of the Independent Accountant shall constitute a final, binding
and non-appealable determination upon which a judgment may be entered by a
court having jurisdiction thereover. If Seller Parent and Purchaser submit any
dispute to the Independent Accountant for a resolution, pursuant to this
Section 2.11, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall each pay their own costs and
expenses incurred. All costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne equally by Seller Parent and Purchaser. 



c.Each of the Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall (i)
be bound by the Preliminary Allocation and the Asset Allocation Schedule as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.11(b) (together with the Preliminary
Allocation, the "Allocation"), for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii)
timely prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to timely prepare and file,
any forms that may be required to be filed pursuant to Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 1060(b) of the Code, including IRS Form 8594 and any
other comparable forms required under applicable Law in a manner consistent
with the Allocation, (iii) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to
prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Allocation,
and (iv) take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position,
inconsistent with the Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any
proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise, except as otherwise
required pursuant to a Final Determination pursuant to applicable Law or as
mutually agreed by the Parties. In the event that a Taxing Authority disputes
the Allocation, the Party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly
notify the other Party, and Seller Parent and Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to defend such Allocation in any applicable
proceeding, and the matter shall be handled as a Tax Claim.



d.The Asset Allocation Schedule, and/or the Allocation, as the case may be,
shall be adjusted to take into account any post-Closing adjustment to the
Preliminary Purchase Price or the Final Purchase Price, including any
modification necessary to reflect the determination of Final Working Capital
and the Final Net Cash as applicable, in each case without any adjustments
contemplated in Section 2.8 in respect of VAT and Transfer Taxes. Any such
adjustment shall be made in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and with
the original preparation of the Preliminary Allocation, the Asset Allocation
Schedule or the Allocation, as applicable, and the Parties shall cooperate
with each other in good faith to promptly amend the Preliminary Allocation,
the Asset Allocation Schedule or the Allocation, as applicable. If after all
other adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with respect to
the Purchased Assets of any Asset Seller or the Allocation with respect to any
Conveyed Subsidiary, when expressed in the relevant local currency at the rate
of exchange used to determine the Final Working Capital and the Final Net
Cash, is less than the local currency net book value, determined in accordance
with the Accounting Principles, of such Purchased Assets or such Conveyed
Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, the Allocation shall be adjusted so that it
is equal to such local currency net book value converted at the rate of
exchange used to determine the Final Working Capital and the Final Net Cash,
and a corresponding adjustment will be made to the Allocation for the other
Purchased Assets and the Conveyed Subsidiaries based on their relative
Preliminary Purchase Price allocation. In the event of any adjustment to the
Allocation, the Parties shall timely provide to, or file with, the Taxing
Authorities any additional documents or information required to be provided or
filed under applicable Law.



Section 2.12 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the
outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Share
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide Seller Parent the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

consistent with such Conveyed Subsidiary's U.S. federal income tax entity
classification, and (ii) have not filed with respect to each Conveyed
Subsidiary any U.S. federal income Tax elections inconsistent with such

o.None of the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their respective Subsidiaries has been

Consolidation Act 1997 ("TCA") apply in the 10 years preceding and including
the date of completion.

Section 4.17 Employee Benefits; Employees.



a.Set forth in Section 4.17(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter is a true and
complete list of each material Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement
and separately identifies each material Company Plan.



b.With respect to each Company Plan, Seller Parent has made available to
Purchaser true and complete copies of each Company Plan and any amendments
thereto (or a written 

summary of all material terms if the Company Plan has not been reduced to
writing). With respect to each Company Plan, Seller Parent has made available
to Purchaser true and complete copies, to the extent applicable, of (i) the
most recent summary plan descriptions with respect to each Company Plan, (ii)
any related trust or other funding vehicle, (iii) the most recent annual
report on IRS Form 5500, to the extent applicable and (iv) the most recent
determination or opinion letter received from the IRS with respect to each
Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code.



c.Each Plan intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code is covered by a determination or opinion letter from IRS upon which
it can rely that it is so qualified or, if no such determination has been
made, either an application for such determination is pending with the IRS or
the time within which such determination may be sought from the IRS has not
yet expired. Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, each Foreign Plan that is intended to qualify for Tax-
preferential treatment under applicable Law so qualifies and has received,
where required, approval from the applicable Governmental Authority that it is
so qualified and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may give
rise to disqualification or loss of Tax-preferential treatment.



d.No Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA, nor is any Plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, none of the Conveyed Subsidiaries (or any Subsidiary
thereof) has any Liability (i) for any Tax imposed under Section 4980B of the
Code, or (ii) for any Tax imposed under 4980H or 9815 of the Code. No Conveyed
Subsidiary or Asset Seller is or has at any time in the last six (6) years
been connected with or an associate of (as those terms are used in the UK
Pensions Act 2004) the employer in a UK defined benefit pension plan. None of
Sellers, any of the Conveyed Subsidiaries (or any Subsidiary thereof), or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to or on
account of, any Plan pursuant to Title IV of ERISA, during the six (6) years
preceding the date of this Agreement, which has not been fully paid.



e.To the Knowledge of Seller Parent, each Plan has been maintained, operated
and administered in material compliance in all respects with its terms and
applicable Law. All contributions required to be made to any Company Plan by
applicable Law and the terms of such Company Plan, and all premiums due or
payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Company Plan, for any
period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to
the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected in the accounting records of the Conveyed Subsidiaries
(or any Subsidiary thereof) to the extent required.



f.Other than routine claims for benefits submitted by participants or
beneficiaries, no claim against, or proceeding involving, any Company Plan or
any fiduciary thereof is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller Parent, is
threatened, which could reasonably be expected to result in any material
Liability, direct or indirect (by indemnification or otherwise) of any
Conveyed Subsidiaries (or any Subsidiary thereof).



g.Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) will (i) 

cause accelerated vesting, payment or delivery of, or increase the amount or
value of, any payment or benefit to any Business Employee, (ii) constitute a
"deemed severance" or "deemed termination" under any Company Plan or (iii)
result in any "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law). No Conveyed
Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) will be required to "gross up" or
otherwise compensate any individual because of the imposition of any Tax on
any payment to the individual.



h.Seller Parent shall have provided to Purchaser a true and complete list of
the Business Employees (non-U.S.) and Business Employees (U.S.) as provided by
Section 1.1(B) and Section 1.1(C), respectively, including the following
information: whether each Business Employee is on leave of absence, and the
employing entity, work location, position, date of hire, base salary, and
bonus opportunity in the current fiscal year. Seller Parent has made available
to Purchaser true and complete copies of each standard form employment
contract applicable to Business Employees (non-U.S.) employed by Asset Sellers
in a jurisdiction where the ARD applies and details of any material deviations
from these standard forms. There is no person engaged to provide personal
services to the Business who is not a Business Employee.



i.(i) No Conveyed Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof), nor any Seller in
connection with the Business is party to any Collective Bargaining Agreement;
(ii) no labor union, labor organization, or works council has made a demand
for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or union elections presently pending or threatened
in writing against any Conveyed Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) or
involving any of the employees of the Business; (iii) during the three (3)
years prior to the date hereof, there have been no, and there are no pending
strikes, picketing, lockouts, work stoppages or slowdowns against any Conveyed
Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) or involving any of the employees of
the Business; (iv) there is no material unfair labor practice charge, labor
arbitration or labor grievance proceeding threatened in writing against any
Conveyed Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) or the Business; and (v) there
is no union, works council or other employee representative group, which must
be notified, consulted or with which negotiations need to be conducted in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



j.Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, Seller Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the Business and
the Conveyed Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable Laws relating to
labor and employment matters, including fair employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, equal employment opportunity, nondiscrimination,
consultation, immigration, labor relations, wages, hours benefits, workers'
compensation, payment of social security and similar Taxes, occupational
health and safety, employee termination, and plant closing.



k.Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller Parent, threatened against Seller with respect to the Business relating
to the alleged violation of any Law pertaining to labor relations or
employment matters. Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, none of Seller Parent, an Asset Seller or a Conveyed
Subsidiary (or any of its Subsidiaries) has in connection with the Business
implemented any plant closing or layoff of employees that could implicate WARN
or any similar Law.



l.Except as set forth on Section 4.17(l) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, no
Conveyed Subsidiary (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Asset Seller has, in the
six (6) years prior to the date hereof, been a party to a transaction whereby
employee Liabilities in relation to early retirement benefits, including those
due to or in relation to redundancy, in each case arising under or in
connection with a UK defined benefit pension plan transferred to it pursuant
to the ARD.



m.The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.17 are the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller Parent with
respect to Plans, Foreign Plans, Collective Bargaining Agreements and other
employee matters.

policy that covers the Business, including its operations, properties, assets
or employees (including a description of any self-insurance program). (b) Such
insurance policies are in full force and effect in all material respects and
all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, and no written notice
that any such insurance policy is no longer in force or effect has been
received by any Seller or Conveyed Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) and,
to the Knowledge of Seller Parent, no Seller or any Conveyed Subsidiary (or
any Subsidiary thereof) is in default in any material respect of any provision
of such insurance policies. (c) The coverage of such insurance policies is
adequate to satisfy all of the contractual insurance obligations required
under the terms of any Material Contract, Shared Contract or Real Property
Lease or as required by applicable Law.

Section 4.19 Brokers. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Guggenheim
Securities, LLC, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Seller Parent. Seller Parent is
solely responsible for the fees and expenses of Goldman, Sachs and Co. and
Guggenheim Securities, LLC and other Seller Transaction Expenses.



Section 4.20 Customers and Suppliers. Section 4.20 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of each supplier and end-user
customer (not including distributors) accounting for more than five (5)
percent of the consolidated purchases or sales, as the case may be, of the
applicable Sellers and the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and Subsidiaries thereof) in
respect of the Business, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Since
January 1, 2016, no such supplier or customer of the Business has cancelled,

Parent, threatened to cancel, terminate or materially and adversely modify,
its relationship with any applicable Seller. Since the January 1, 2016, no
Seller or Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) has received any written

materially and adversely modify its relationship with such applicable Seller
or Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) either as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise.



Section 4.21 Customer Warranties. As of the date hereof, there are no pending,

ARTICLE V



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

Except (a) as disclosed or reflected in the SEC Reports, but excluding any
risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or
any other statements that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in
nature, in each case, other than any specific factual information contained
therein, or (b) as set forth in the Purchaser Disclosure Letter and in
accordance with Section 10.11 (other than with respect to Section 5.3, which
shall not be subject to the foregoing exceptions), Purchaser hereby represents
and warrants to Seller Parent as follows:

Section 5.1 Organization. Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware.



Section 5.2 Authority; Binding Effect.



a.Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a party, and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery
by Purchaser of this Agreement and by Purchaser and each Purchaser Designated
Affiliate of each Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a party, and the
performance by Purchaser and such Purchaser Designated Affiliates of their
obligations hereunder and thereunder, have been, or will have been at the
Closing, duly authorized by all requisite corporate or other action.



b.This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and,
assuming this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller Parent,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, and each Ancillary
Agreement will be duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and each Purchaser
Designated Affiliate to which it will be a party and will, assuming such
Ancillary Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Seller that
will be a party thereto, constitute a valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and such Purchaser Designated Affiliate, in each case enforceable
against Purchaser and such Purchaser Designated Affiliate in accordance with
its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or law).



Section 5.3 Capitalization.



a.As of August 31, 2016, the authorized capital stock of Purchaser consists of
80,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock, of which 16,231,547 shares are
issued and outstanding, no shares are issued and held in the treasury of
Purchaser, and 2,287,315 shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to the
grant of equity awards under Purchaser Equity Compensation Plans. Since
September 1, 2016 through the date of this Agreement, there have been no
issuances of Purchaser Equity Securities or other securities of Purchaser
other than shares that were reserved for issuance pursuant to Purchaser Equity
Compensation Plans. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Purchaser are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.



b.Except for Purchaser Equity Securities issued or reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Purchaser Equity Compensation Plans as set forth in Section
5.3(a) and as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as
of the date of this Agreement, there are no (and no plans to issue)
outstanding warrants, options, Contracts, subscriptions, redemptions, profit
participations, stock appreciation, phantom stock, rights of first offer or
refusal, anti-dilution rights, preemptive rights or other rights, convertible
or exchangeable securities or other commitments, whether written or oral,

obligated to issue, sell, purchase, return, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Purchaser Equity Securities or other securities of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no equity interests of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
are reserved for issuance for any purpose. There are no voting trusts,
stockholder agreements, Liens, proxies or other rights or Contracts in effect
with respect to the voting, transfer or dividend rights of Purchaser's capital 

stock to which Purchaser is a party or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, between
or among Purchaser's stockholders. The issuance of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock pursuant to the Share Consideration will not obligate Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue Purchaser Equity Securities or other securities
of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Seller Parent or
its Affiliates) and will not result in a right of any holder of Purchaser's
securities to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under
any of such securities.



c.Section 5.3(c) of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter includes a list of all of
the Subsidiaries of Purchaser. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each Significant Subsidiary have been validly
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens, other than applicable
restrictions arising under securities Laws. Neither Purchaser nor any of its
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or
any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity that is or would reasonably be expected to be material to Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.



d.Purchaser has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations,
the holders of which have the right to vote (or are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
Purchaser on any matter.



Section 5.4 No Conflicts; Consents. The execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not (i) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
Purchaser, (ii) conflict with, constitute a default under, or result in the
breach or termination, cancellation or acceleration (whether after the giving
of notice or the lapse of time or both) of any right or obligation of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under any material Contract to which
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party or is subject, or (iii) assuming
compliance with the matters set forth in Sections 4.5 and 5.5, violate or
result in a breach of or constitute a default under any Law or other
restriction of any Governmental Authority to which Purchaser is subject,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) for any violations, breaches,
conflicts, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.



Section 5.5 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Purchaser does not require any Approval of,
or Filing with, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) the expiration or
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) the Approvals
and Filings set forth in Annex C, (iii) the notice or application to the
Nasdaq Global Select Market for the acquisition and issuance of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock constituting the Share Consideration for trading
thereon, and (iv) such other the Approvals and Filings which if not obtained
or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.



Section 5.6 Third Party Approvals. The execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby do not
require any consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals of, or filings with
or notifications to, any third parties which have not been obtained by
Purchaser (other than as contemplated by Sections 5.5 and 6.7(a)).



Section 5.7 Available Funds.



a.Purchaser has delivered to Seller Parent true, correct and complete fully
executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of October 6, 2016, among
Purchaser, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
and Barclays Bank PLC, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments to such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
including the fee letter (in a redacted form removing only the fee amounts and
economic information, but which redacted fee amounts and economic information
does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Financing) (collectively, the "Commitment
Letter"), pursuant to which, subject only to the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter, each of the parties thereto (other than Purchaser) has
severally committed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of
such funds as set forth therein, the "Financing") for the purposes set forth
in such Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter has not been amended,
restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise
modified in any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and in each case, no such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver is
contemplated. The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Purchaser and,
to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and to general
principles of equity. There are no conditions or contingencies (including
pursuant to any "flex" provisions) related to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letter, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together
with other financial resources of Purchaser, including cash on hand and
marketable securities of Purchaser, shall, in the aggregate, be sufficient for
the satisfaction of all of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement,
including the payment of the Final Purchase Price and all fees and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection herewith. No event has
occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach) on the part of Purchaser or its Affiliates or, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, on the part of any other party to the Commitment
Letter, or the failure of any condition, on the part of Purchaser or its
Affiliates under the Commitment Letter or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the
other parties thereto or would otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing to be unavailable. Assuming the accuracy of Seller Parent's
representations and warranties hereunder such that the condition set forth in
Section 8.2(a) would be satisfied, as of the date hereof, Purchaser has no
reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any "flex"
provisions contained in the Commitment Letter) that any of the conditions to
the Financing shall not be satisfied on a timely basis on or prior to the
Closing, or that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the
satisfaction of all of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement and of all
fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection herewith
shall not be available to Purchaser on the Closing Date. There are no side
letters or other Contracts, instruments or other commitments, obligations or
arrangements (whether written or oral) related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letter and delivered to Seller Parent prior to the date of this 

Agreement. Purchaser has fully paid all commitment fees and other amounts
required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection
with the Financing, and Purchaser represents that any other fees or other
amounts that are due under the Commitment Letter are required to be paid no
earlier than the Closing.



b.Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on the Closing Date.



Section 5.8 Share Consideration. The Share Consideration shall be, at the time
of issuance, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
free and clear of all Liens and will not be issued in breach or violation of
any preemptive rights or Contract. Assuming the accuracy of Seller Parent's
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.23, the issuance of the
Share Consideration in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement is
exempt from registration under the Securities Act and otherwise issued in
compliance with all Laws.



Section 5.9 Securities Act. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares solely for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with,
any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Purchaser
acknowledges that the Shares are not registered under the Securities Act, any
applicable state securities Law or any applicable foreign securities Laws, and
that such Shares may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the
registration provisions of the Securities Act or applicable foreign securities
Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant to state
securities Laws as applicable. Purchaser (either alone or together with its
Representatives) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment.



Section 5.10 No Litigation. There is no material action, order, writ,
injunction, judgment or decree outstanding, or suit, litigation, proceeding,
labor dispute (other than routine grievance procedures or routine, uncontested
claims for benefits under any benefit plans for any officers, employees or
agents of Purchaser), arbitration, investigation or reported claim, pending
or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, before any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator, which seeks to delay or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or would, if adversely determined,
materially impair or delay the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Neither Purchaser nor any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates is subject to any outstanding decree of any
Governmental Order which would, individually or in the aggregate, materially
impair or delay the ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder, other than any such Governmental Order
after the date hereof relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 5.11 Brokers. Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser. Purchaser is solely responsible for any such fees and
expenses.



Section 5.12 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Section 8.2(a), immediately after the Closing, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and their respective Subsidiaries) will be Solvent. No transfer
of property is being made, and no obligation is being incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent of
Purchaser to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Purchaser, any Seller or any Conveyed Subsidiary or any of their Subsidiaries.



Section 5.13 SEC Reports; Financial Statements.



a.Purchaser has filed with or furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by
Purchaser under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, including pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) thereof, and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ
for the three-year period preceding the date of this Agreement (the foregoing
materials, including the exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by

filing and has filed any such SEC Reports prior to the expiration of any such
extension. As of their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, and none of the SEC Reports,
when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.



b.The financial statements of Purchaser included (or incorporated by
reference) in the SEC Reports (including the notes thereto) comply in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of
filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except as may be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes
thereto and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain all
footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the
financial position of Purchaser and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of and
for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments. Since January 1, 2015, Purchaser has not made any
change in the accounting practices and policies applied in the preparation of
its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law. No financial statements of any Person other than Purchaser are
required by GAAP to be included in the financial statements of Purchaser.



Section 5.14 Internal Accounting and Disclosure Controls. Purchaser maintains
a system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under 

the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of Purchaser's financial reporting and the preparation of
Purchaser's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP
and that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general
or specific authorization, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability, (c) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (d) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Purchaser's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are adequate and
effective to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Purchaser in the reports it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms. Purchaser's management has completed an
evaluation of the effectiveness of Purchaser's internal controls over
financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and has concluded that such internal
controls were effective. Purchaser has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date of this Agreement, to Purchaser's auditors and audit committee (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Purchaser's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting. Purchaser's
management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
Purchaser's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable SEC Report that is a report on
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation (and as of the most recent evaluation, such
disclosure controls and procedures were effective). Since the date of the most
recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures and internal
controls, there have been no material changes in such controls or in other
factors that would reasonably be expected to materially affect disclosure
controls and procedures or internal controls, including any corrective actions
with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.



Section 5.15 Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Purchaser Common Stock
is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Purchaser has
taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have the
effect of, terminating the registration of Purchaser Common Stock under the
Exchange Act nor has Purchaser received any written notification that the SEC
is contemplating terminating such registration. Purchaser is in material
compliance with the listing and maintenance requirements and any other
applicable rules and regulations of the NASDAQ.



Section 5.16 No Undisclosed Liabilities. As of the date hereof, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations, claims,
Indebtedness or other Liabilities of any nature or kind whatsoever (whether
accrued, known or unknown, absolute, contingent or otherwise) except for (i)
Liabilities accrued for, reflected on, disclosed and/or reserved against in
the audited consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2015 included in the SEC Reports, (ii) 

accounts payable to trade creditors and accrued expenses incurred subsequent
to the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and (iii) Liabilities incurred in connection with or arising
out of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, other than
Liabilities which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.



Section 5.17 Absence of Material Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date through
the date hereof, there has not been any change, circumstance, development,
state of facts, occurrence or event that has had, individually or in the
aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and no change, circumstance,
development, state of facts, occurrence, or event exists or has occurred which
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.18 Compliance with Laws.



a.Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates are, and have been since
September 30, 2013, in compliance with all applicable Laws and Governmental
Orders, and Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates are not subject to any
Governmental Order, in each case except where any instances of noncompliance
or being subject to Governmental Orders, as applicable, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.



b.Since September 30, 2013, the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
have not received any warning letters, notices of adverse findings, or similar
documents that assert a lack of material compliance with any applicable Laws,
Governmental Authorizations, Governmental Orders, or regulatory requirements
that have not been fully resolved in all material respects to the satisfaction
of any Governmental Authority, and there is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened material regulatory or enforcement Action of any sort
(other than non-material routine or periodic inspections or reviews) against
Purchaser, except where such lack of compliance or such failure to fully
resolve any such enforcement Action would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.



c.Since September 30, 2011, none of Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any of their respective Representatives
has taken any action which would cause Purchaser to be in violation of, in any
material respect, the Anti-Corruption Laws, U.S. False Claims Act, U.S. Anti-
Kickback Statute, or any applicable Law of similar effect of another
jurisdiction, except where any such violations would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.



d.Since September 30, 2015, none of Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any Representative of the Business, has
(i) conducted any business in or for the benefit of Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
North Sudan or Syria, unless authorized to do so by an appropriate U.S.
Governmental Authority, or (ii) engaged in any transaction, activity or
conduct with or for the benefit of any Person that is the target of Sanctions,
except where the conduct of such business or any such transaction, activity or
conduct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be 

expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates are in material compliance with the U.S.
antiboycott Laws and applicable foreign Laws of similar effect.



Section 5.19 Condition of the Business; No Reliance.



a.Purchaser acknowledges that it is not relying on any representation or
warranty of Seller Parent, other than those representations and warranties
specifically set forth in Article IV of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of the financial condition, results of operations
and projected operations of the Business and the nature and condition of its
properties, assets, liabilities and businesses and, in making the
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby, has relied
solely on the results of its own independent investigation and the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV. Purchaser acknowledges
that neither Seller Parent nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding any of the Sellers, the Business, the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (or their Subsidiaries), the Shares, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities not expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement. In light of these inspections and investigations and the
representations and warranties made to Purchaser by Seller Parent in Article
IV (and other than with respect to claims involving fraud), Purchaser is
relinquishing any right to any claim based on any representations and
warranties other than those specifically included in Article IV. Any claims
Purchaser may have for breach of representation or warranty shall be based
solely on the representations and warranties of Seller Parent set forth in
Article IV.



b.Purchaser acknowledges that, except as explicitly set forth herein, neither
Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates has made any warranty, express or
implied, as to the prospects of the Business or its profitability for
Purchaser, or with respect to any forecasts, projections or business plans
prepared by or on behalf of the Sellers and delivered to Purchaser in
connection with Purchaser's review of the Business and the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement.



c.Subject to Section 6.12(b), Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is
Purchaser's responsibility to apply for its own Product Registrations and
Manufacturing Registrations to the relevant Governmental Authorities.



Section 5.20 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article V, neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
the Share Consideration or with respect to any other information provided, or
made available, to Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the prospects of the business of Purchaser or its Subsidiary or
its profitability for Seller Parent, or with respect to any forecasts,
projections or business plans prepared by or on behalf of Purchaser and
delivered to Seller Parent in connection with Seller Parent's review with
respect to the Share Consideration and the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement. Neither Purchaser nor any other Person will have, or be 

subject to, any liability or other obligation to Seller Parent, its Affiliates
or Representatives or any other Person resulting from the issuance of the
Share Consideration to Seller Parent or Seller Parent's use of, or the use by
any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any information, including
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Seller Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives in a virtual data room, management presentations, offering
materials, site tours or visits, diligence calls or meetings or any documents
prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser or its Affiliates, unless any such
information is expressly and specifically included in a representation or
warranty contained in this Article V. Each of Purchaser and its Affiliates
disclaims any and all other representations and warranties, whether express or
implied. None of the foregoing in this Section 5.20 shall in any event be
deemed to relieve any Party from Liability for fraud.



ARTICLE VI



COVENANTS



Section 6.1 Information and Documents.



a.From and after the date hereof and pending the Closing, upon reasonable
advance notice, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit Purchaser and its
Representatives to have reasonable access, during regular normal business
hours, to (i) the Real Property, and (ii) the books and records of the
Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) and the Sellers (in respect of
the Business) and to such personnel, offices and other facilities and
properties of the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) and the
Sellers (in respect of the Business) and to furnish such other information in
respect of the Business as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser; provided,
that all requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be directed to
and coordinated with a Person or Persons designated by Seller Parent;
provided, however, that no such access shall unreasonably interfere with the
Sellers' and the Conveyed Subsidiaries' (and their Subsidiaries') operation of
their respective businesses, including the Business; and provided, further,
that the Sellers may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (A) in
the reasonable judgment of the Sellers, applicable Law requires the Sellers to
restrict or prohibit access to such information, (B) in the reasonable
judgment of the Sellers, such information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a third party, (C) in the reasonable judgment of the Sellers,
such disclosure would result in disclosure of any proprietary information or
any information that is competitively or commercially sensitive, (D) the
information exclusively relates to the exploration of strategic alternatives
for the Business by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates (or their
Representatives) or their evaluation of the Business in connection therewith,
including projections or other financial or other information relating
thereto, (E) disclosure of any such information could result in the loss or
waiver of the attorney-client or other applicable privilege or (F) the
information would give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate the
rights under any Contract of the Business; provided, that in each case, Seller
Parent shall: (i) give reasonable notice to Purchaser of the fact that it is
restricting or otherwise prohibiting access to any documents or information
pursuant to this Section 6.1), (ii) inform Purchaser with sufficient detail of
the reason for such restriction or prohibition, and (iii) use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the documents or information that are subject to such
restriction or prohibition to be provided in a manner reasonably proposed by 

Purchaser that would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or
prohibition. It is further agreed that, prior to the Closing, Purchaser and
its Representatives shall not contact any of the employees, customers,
distributors or suppliers of the Sellers or the Conveyed Subsidiaries (or
their Subsidiaries) with respect to the Business and in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in person or by
telephone, mail, or other means of communication, without the specific prior
authorization by Seller Parent, which authorization shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event shall the Sellers or the Conveyed Subsidiaries
be required to provide any information to the extent it relates to any
Retained Businesses, any Excluded Assets (other than Shared Contracts to the
extent allocated to Purchaser pursuant to the Logistics and Services
Agreement) or any Retained Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
Parent shall not have any obligation under this Section 6.1 to provide any
copies of its Consolidated Tax Returns to Purchaser; provided, however, that
if any such Tax Return relates to Purchaser's Tax liability for a Post-Closing
Tax Period, Seller Parent shall provide reasonable access to the relevant
information contained in such Tax Return to Purchaser (including, at Seller
Parent's reasonable discretion, by way of providing excerpted parts of such
Tax Return, redacted in the manner Seller Parent deems necessary).



b.All information received by Purchaser and given by or on behalf of the
Sellers in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby will be held by Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives as

eliminate and resolve any impediment to avoid the imposition of a Phase II
investigation or equivalent and to obtain necessary Approvals, in order to
allow the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in any event prior to the Outside Date, including, to the extent
so necessary or required, proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and
effect (and if such offer is accepted, committing to and effecting) through
order, consent decree, settlement or otherwise, to (A) license, sell, divest,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the
Purchased Assets, the Shares or any Subsidiary, operations, divisions,
specific assets or categories of assets, specific products or categories of
products, product lines, or businesses of the Conveyed Subsidiaries (or any
Subsidiary thereof) or the Business or of Purchaser or its Affiliates (whether
now owned or hereafter acquired by Purchaser or its Affiliates), (B) terminate
any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries)
and any such relationship, rights or obligations that form part of the
Purchased Assets, (C) amend or terminate any licenses or other Intellectual
Property agreements of Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Conveyed Subsidiaries
(and their Subsidiaries) and any such licenses or agreements that form a part
of the Purchased Assets and enter into such new licenses or other Intellectual
Property agreements, and (D) take any actions or make any behavioral
commitments that may limit or modify Purchaser's and its Affiliates', or the
Conveyed Subsidiaries' (or any of their Subsidiaries') rights of ownership in,
or ability to conduct the business of, one or more of its operations,
divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets, including, after
the Closing, those of the Business or any of the Purchased Assets, in each
case, to the minimum extent necessary so as to permit and cause the 

condition set forth in Section 8.1(b) to be satisfied by the Outside Date. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser shall keep Seller Parent reasonably
informed of all matters, discussions and activities relating to any of the
matters described in or contemplated by clauses (A) through (D) of this
Section 6.4(c)(iv). For clarity, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be
required to take any action (or not take any action) that has not been made a
requirement or condition by a Governmental Antitrust Authority to the Closing;
and



v.In the event that any Action is threatened or commenced, or a permanent or
preliminary injunction or other Governmental Order is threatened or entered,
that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Ancillary Agreements in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, other
than in connection with any injunctive or other non-monetary relief, Purchaser
shall promptly take any and all actions and steps (including the defense
against or appeal thereof, the posting of a bond and the taking of the steps
contemplated by this Section 6.4(c)(v)) necessary to resist and contest such
proceeding and to have vacated, modified, reversed or suspended such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation by the Outside Date.



d.Each of Seller Parent and Purchaser shall to the extent permitted by
applicable Antitrust Law (i) promptly notify the other Party of, and, if in
writing, provide to the other Party copies of (or in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally of) all material communication between
it (or its Representatives) and any Governmental Antitrust Authority relating
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary Agreements or any of the matters described in this Section 6.4, (ii)
to the extent reasonably practicable, permit the other to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other and incorporate
the other's comments in connection with, any Filings, notifications, or
material communication (whether written or oral) with any Governmental
Antitrust Authority, including any presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions or proposals, (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
not participate in any telephone calls or meetings with a Governmental
Antitrust Authority regarding the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements or any of the matters
described in this Section 6.4 without consulting with the other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Antitrust Authority, giving
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate thereat.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall
control and have the authority to make the ultimate determinations regarding
all matters related to the defense of this Agreement before any Governmental
Antitrust Authority, including which Governmental Antitrust Authorities will
receive notifications for this Agreement.



e.In the event an Approval of a Governmental Antitrust Authority (other than a
Governmental Antitrust Authority of the United States of America or set forth
in Annex C hereto) having jurisdiction that is necessary to lawfully
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is not obtained 

on or prior to the date on which the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(a),
8.1(b) and 8.2 (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived, Purchaser
and Seller Parent agree, subject to the limitations imposed by applicable Law,
to effect the Closing (including payment of the full Preliminary Purchase
Price), subject to the terms of this Agreement, with respect to all Shares,
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities outside of the jurisdiction of any
such Governmental Antitrust Authority; provided, however, that the obligations
of the Parties set forth in this Section 6.4 shall continue with respect to
any such Approval that has not been obtained until such Approval is obtained,
and upon obtaining such Approval, the Parties shall effect the transfer of the
affected Shares, Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities in accordance with
the Local Implementing Agreements for the jurisdiction relating thereto;
provided, further, that none of the Purchased Assets located in, or licensors,
suppliers, distributors, customers and others having business relationships
with the Business operating in, or Product Registrations, Manufacturing
Registrations, Environmental Permits, or Governmental Authorizations
registered in such jurisdiction of any such Governmental Antitrust Authority
is material to the Business. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
such transfer, upon its occurrence, shall be retroactive to and be deemed to
have occurred on the Closing Date. With respect to any such Approval that has
not been obtained as described in this Section 6.4(e), as of the Closing Date,
Seller Parent and Purchaser shall, unless prohibited by applicable Law, enter
into mutually agreeable alternative business arrangements consistent with the
terms of this Agreement or other arrangements which provide Purchaser with the
"net economic benefit" or loss of the affected Conveyed Subsidiaries (or
Subsidiaries thereof) and Purchased Assets from and after the Closing Date and
continuing until any such Approval is obtained. Seller Parent will defend,
indemnity and hold harmless Purchaser and any of its Affiliates for and
against any Liabilities arising out of or relating to any such alternative
business arrangement.



f.Neither Seller Parent nor Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
shall acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into, consolidating
with, by purchasing all or a portion of the assets of or all or a portion of
the equity in, any entity owning or having any rights in any business of the
type and character of, or that competes with, all or any part of, the
Business, or take any other action, including entering into, or agreeing to
enter into, any material license, joint venture or other agreement or
transaction, which would reasonably be expected to, in each case or in the
aggregate, (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of
not obtaining the expiration, termination or waiver of any applicable waiting
period or any consent, approval, permit, ruling, authorization or clearance
pursuant to the Antitrust Laws necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Antitrust Authority entering an injunction or order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Ancillary Agreements, (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on injunction on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements. Neither Seller Parent nor Purchaser shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Ancillary Agreements or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other Filing made pursuant to any other Antitrust Law
unless, in the case of Purchaser seeking such extension or delay, Seller
Parent has given its prior written consent to such extension or delay or, in
the case of Seller Parent such extension or delay, Purchaser has given its
prior written consent to such extension or delay.



g.Each of Seller Parent and Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 6.4 as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material" or
some similar notation agreed by the Parties. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the internal and outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such counsel
to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Seller Parent or
Purchaser, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.4, materials provided to the other Party or
its counsel may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning valuation of
the Business or any of the Conveyed Subsidiaries or Purchased Assets, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual requirements, (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns and (iv) to remove references concerning pricing and other
competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective in the Contracts
of Seller Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries.



h.Filing fees in connection with the Filings shall be payable by the Party
responsible for making such payment pursuant to applicable Law.



i.For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants set forth in this Section 6.4
(other than 6.4(j) below) expire as of the Closing, subject to the terms of
Section 7.4, except as set forth in Section 6.4(e) and Section 6.4(h).



j.Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock constituting the Share Consideration to be approved for
listing on the NASDAQ, with such listing to be effective as of the Closing,
subject only to official notice of issuance.



Section 6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances.



a.Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and subject to
Section 6.4, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
before and, as may be applicable, after the Closing Date to take or cause to
be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws (other than with respect to Antitrust Laws which are the
subject of Section 6.4) to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, including: (i) the preparation, negotiation and finalization of
the Ancillary Agreements, and, following the Closing, the administration and
coordination of the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the Parties, (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions, consents, approvals and waivers of all
Governmental Authorities under applicable Law (other than with respect to
Antitrust Laws which are the subject of Section 6.4), (iv) to the extent
consistent with, but without limiting, the obligations of the Parties set
forth in Section 6.4, the defending of any Action, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the performance of the
obligations hereunder, (v) the effecting of all registrations, filings and
transfers of Environmental Permits necessary for the operation of the Business
and required under Environmental Laws, (vi) the executing, acknowledging and
delivering such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other
documents and instruments and 

the taking of such other actions as may reasonably be requested by the other
Party in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreements, and (vii) the conveying and transferring to, and vesting in,
Purchaser and the Purchaser Designated Affiliates of, the Shares, Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities, as contemplated by this Agreement, the Local
Implementing Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
From and after the date hereof, each Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take the actions set forth in Section 6.5 and each Party agrees to
the provisions set forth on Section 6.5 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.



b.Without limiting and in furtherance of the provisions of Section 6.5(a), and
in order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements on a timely basis, promptly
following the date hereof, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall organize a
transition team (the "Transition Team"), co-chaired by a representative of
Seller Parent and by a representative of Purchaser and including equal
representation of Seller Parent and Purchaser, which Transition Team shall
have responsibility for (i) coordinating and directing the efforts of the
Parties with respect to (A) the preparation, negotiation and finalization of
the Ancillary Agreements, including identifying the services to be provided by
Seller Parent to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries after the Closing pursuant to
the terms of the Transitional Services Agreement, in each case, the applicable
periods for such services, it being understood that the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to agree upon all matters in the Transitional
Services Agreement, (B) the administration and coordination of the Ancillary
Agreements following the Closing, (C) subject to Section 6.4, obtaining or
making all third party consents, approvals, notifications and Governmental
Authorizations that are necessary or desirable in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (D) coordinating and
directing the efforts of the Parties with respect to obtaining the Financing
in accordance with Section 6.28, (ii) negotiating in good faith and agree on a
fair allocation of assets that are related both to the Business and the
Retained Businesses, with such allocation to take into account and be based on
the relative historical use of such assets by each business and the allocation
of costs associated with such assets in accordance with the Logistics and
Services Agreement, (iii) coordinating and directing the efforts of the
Parties with respect to the retention of Information relating to the Business,
access to Information of the Business and to personnel, and financial
reporting assistance in accordance with Section 6.10, (iv) communications,
public relations and investor relations strategy and approach of the Parties
regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (v)
overseeing other business and operational matters relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including transitional plans of
Purchaser and Seller Parent following the Closing, to the extent not in
violation of applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of
information and Antitrust Laws.



c.If the Parties disagree upon any matter subject to the oversight of the
Transition Team, the members of the Transition Team shall work together in
good faith to resolve the disagreement in a mutually acceptable manner. In the
event that the Transition Team is unable to resolve such disagreement in a
timely manner, and in any event within five (5) days of written notice of such
disagreement by one Party to the other, the matter in dispute shall be
elevated to Douglas E. Giordano of Seller Parent and Vivek Jain of Purchaser
for further good faith discussion. During the course of all such discussions,
the Parties shall cooperate with each other and all reasonable requests made
by one Party to the other for information, including requests for copies of
relevant documents, will be honored. In the 

event that any disagreement is not resolved by the Parties within fifteen (15)
days following delivery of the written notice mentioned above, the Parties may
seek any remedies to which they may be entitled in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall prevent either Party
from initiating proceedings in accordance with this Agreement if such Party
would be substantially harmed by a failure to act during the time that such
good faith efforts are being made to resolve the disagreement through
negotiation or if the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
would reasonably be expected to be delayed. In the event that any proceeding
is commenced under this Section 6.5(c), the Parties agree to continue to work
in good faith to resolve any disagreement according to the terms of this
Section 6.5 during the course of such proceeding.



Section 6.6 Tax Matters.



a.Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. Seller Parent shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all (i) Tax Returns of
the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) required to be filed for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that is not part of a Straddle Period, (ii)
Consolidated Tax Returns of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) that include a Conveyed
Subsidiary (or a Subsidiary thereof) required to be filed for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, or (iii) Tax Returns of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) that include or
reflect the Purchased Assets required to be filed for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, in the case of the Tax Returns described in clause (i) or (ii) on a
basis consistent with past practice of the applicable taxpayer, except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law. In the case of any Tax Return
that is described in the immediately preceding sentence and is required to be
filed after the Closing by a Conveyed Subsidiary (or a Subsidiary thereof),
Purchaser shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, such Tax Return as
prepared by Seller Parent, provided, that such Tax Return was delivered to
Purchaser at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return, or five (5) Business Days in the case of a non-Income Tax
Return (in each case taking into account any applicable extensions), together
with any supporting information that Purchaser reasonably requests in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1, for Purchaser's review and
comment. If Purchaser disputes any item on such Tax Return that (A) in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser, is not supportable under applicable Law or
(B) could increase the Tax liability of, or reduce any Tax benefit available
to, Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) for any Post-Closing Tax Period, then Purchaser shall notify
Seller Parent of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for the
objection. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to
be filed. If Purchaser and Seller Parent cannot resolve any such disputed
item, then the item in question shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountant, the fees of which shall be shared based on the principles of
Section 2.10(d). If such dispute process is not completed by the due date for
the applicable Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions), such
Tax return shall be filed with only such revisions as have been agreed to by
Seller Parent; provided, however, that following the resolution of any
dispute, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall make any necessary amendments to
such Tax Return. Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed by
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries after the Closing, including those in respect of 

the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries), the Purchased Assets or
the Business. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Purchaser
for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller Parent for its approval,
at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return, or five (5) Business Days in the case of a non-Income Tax
Return (in each case taking into account any applicable extensions), a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which Seller Parent is
responsible pursuant to Sections 6.6(e)(i) and 6.6(e)(iii) and a copy of such
Tax Return, together with any additional information that Seller Parent
reasonably requests, for Seller Parent's review and comment. Purchaser shall
reflect on the filed Tax Return any reasonable comment regarding any pre-
Closing item on such Tax Return submitted by Seller Parent at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return or three (3) Business
Days in the case of a non-Income Tax Return. If Purchaser disputes such
comment or Seller Parent disputes any other item on such Tax Return, then the
disputing Party shall notify the other Party of such disputed item (or items)
and the basis for the objection. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax
Return is required to be filed. If Purchaser and Seller Parent cannot resolve
any disputed item, then the item in question shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant, the fees of which shall be shared based on principles
of Section 2.10(d). If such dispute process is not completed by the due date
for the applicable Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions),
such Tax Return shall be filed by Purchaser with Seller Parent's comments to
the pre-Closing items and such other revisions as have been agreed with Seller
Parent; provided, however, that following the resolution of any dispute
Purchaser shall make any necessary amendments to such Tax Return. Any Tax
Return of a Conveyed Subsidiary (or a Subsidiary thereof) for a Straddle
Period shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on the basis
that the relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date. Except as required by applicable Law, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates (including any Conveyed Subsidiary and Subsidiaries thereof) shall
file an amended Tax Return, or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute
of limitations, relating to Taxes with respect to any Conveyed Subsidiary (and
Subsidiaries thereof), the Purchased Assets or the Business for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period without the prior written consent of Seller Parent. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Party that is legally required to file
any Tax Return or other document with respect to Transfer Taxes shall timely
file such Tax Return or document, including timely complying with state bulk
sale notification requirements or other similar notification requirements,
such as obtaining Tax clearance certificates (and the other Party shall
cooperate with respect thereto).



b.Except for Taxes that are accrued or reserved for in the Final Closing
Statement, Seller Parent shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid all Taxes
due with respect to Tax Returns described in Sections 6.6(a)(i) and 6.6(a)(ii)
and all Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns for Straddle Periods for which
Seller Parent is responsible pursuant to Sections 6.6(e)(i) and 6.6(e)(iii).
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to Tax
Returns which Purchaser is obligated to prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, pursuant to Section 6.6(a), or otherwise with respect to
the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and Subsidiaries thereof), the Purchased Assets and
the Business for any Post-Closing Tax Period, and which Seller Parent is not
obligated to pay pursuant to the preceding sentence.



c.Carryforwards and Carrybacks. Purchaser shall cause the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, to carryforward any Tax 

asset, including any net capital loss, net operating loss, foreign Tax credit,
charitable contribution credit or research and development credit, arising
after the Closing Date that could, whether in the absence of an election or
otherwise, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall take,
and cause its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) to take, all steps necessary to achieve such carryforward,
including by making all necessary elections. Except to the extent prohibited
by applicable Law, Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates, hereby waives any right to use or apply in any Pre-Closing Tax
Period any Tax asset, including any net capital loss, net operating loss,
foreign Tax credit, charitable contribution credit or research and development
credit, of any Conveyed Subsidiary arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period.



d.Refunds. Seller Parent shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate
payment from Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Subsidiaries and Subsidiaries thereof) with respect to, any refund,
credit or other similar benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes
attributable to any Conveyed Subsidiary (and Subsidiaries thereof), the
Purchased Assets or the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (to the extent
such Taxes were paid by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (excluding
after the Closing the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries)),
including any such amounts arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed
after the Closing Date, net of any cost to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and receipt of such
refund, credit or other similar benefit; provided, however, that Seller Parent
shall not be entitled to any refund, credit or other similar benefit to the
extent such refund, credit or other similar benefit (i) arises as the result
of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit from a Post-Closing Tax Period
or (ii) was included as an asset in the Final Closing Statement. In connection
with the foregoing, if Seller Parent determines that any of the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (or Subsidiaries thereof) is entitled to file or make a formal or
informal claim for a refund of Taxes (including by filing an amended Tax
Return) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller Parent shall be
entitled to file or make, or to request that Purchaser cause the applicable
Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) to file or make, such formal or
informal claim for refund, and Seller Parent shall be entitled to control the
prosecution of such claim for refund at its own expense, in which case
Purchaser shall have the same rights with respect to Seller Parent's control
of such claim as if the claim were governed by Section 6.6(f)(ii). Purchaser
shall cooperate, and cause the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with respect to such claim for refund, and shall pay, or cause the
relevant Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) to pay, to Seller Parent
the amount (including interest) of any related refund, credit or other similar
benefit received or realized by Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including
any Conveyed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof), net of any cost to Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and
receipt of such refund, credit or other similar benefit, within five (5) days
of receipt (or realization) thereof. Purchaser and the Conveyed Subsidiaries
and their Subsidiaries shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate
payment from Seller Parent with respect to, any refund, credit or other
similar benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to any
Conveyed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof, Purchased Assets or the Business
for a Post-Closing Tax Period, net of any cost to Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and receipt of such
refund, credit or other similar benefit. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall
equitably apportion any refund, credit or other similar benefit received or
realized with respect to Taxes attributable to any Conveyed Subsidiary (or
Subsidiary thereof), the 

Purchased Assets or the Business for a Straddle Period in a manner consistent
with the principles set forth in Section 6.6(e)(iii).



e.Tax Indemnification.



i.Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Closing, Seller
Parent agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) from
and against all liability, without duplication, for (1) Taxes of the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Taxes resulting from the Internal Restructurings or any of the
transactions contemplated by Sections 2.4(b) and 6.2(c), Taxes that may not be
known at the time of the Closing or Taxes resulting from transfer pricing
adjustments); (2) Taxes of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
to the extent arising directly from, or directly relating to, the Purchased
Assets or the Business; (3) Taxes of another Person (other than the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) for which the Conveyed Subsidiaries and
their Subsidiaries are liable (i) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6(a) (or a similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) due to
joining in the filing of a Consolidated Tax Return with such Person on or
before the Closing, (ii) as a result of being a transferee or successor of
such Person, or otherwise, on or before or as a result of the Closing pursuant
to any Law or (iii) pursuant to a Tax sharing or indemnity agreement or
similar agreement (other than agreements or arrangements entered into in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice as arm's length
commercial agreements or arrangements that do not relate primarily to Taxes,
such as loan or leasing agreements) to which the Conveyed Subsidiaries or
their Subsidiaries and such Person were a party on or before the Closing; (4)
Taxes of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) imposed on Purchaser or its Affiliates as
a result of being a transferee or successor of Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) on
or before, or as a result of, the Closing pursuant to any Law; (5) Taxes of
Purchaser and its Affiliates resulting from the breach by Seller Parent or any
of its Affiliates of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.16(i) and (n) or any covenants in Sections 6.2(b)(xi) and 6.6 (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, a breach of any representation or
warranty other than those specified in this clause (5)); and (6) any Transfer
Taxes for which Seller Parent or its Affiliates are liable pursuant to Section
6.6(h) (the "Excluded Taxes"); provided, however, that (i) Seller Parent's
indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to this Section 6.6(e) shall be
reduced by the amount of any refunds of Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods to the extent received after the Closing Date by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries)
and not remitted to Seller Parent pursuant to Section 6.6(d) prior to the date
on which Seller Parent is required to make the applicable indemnity payment
hereunder (it being understood that Purchaser shall no longer be required to
pay over such refund of Taxes to Seller Parent pursuant to Section 6.6(d) to
the extent of any such reduction); (ii) Seller Parent shall not 

defend, indemnify or hold harmless Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) from any
liability for Taxes that would otherwise give rise to a Seller Parent Tax
indemnity obligation under this Section 6.6(e), attributable to (A) Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) making, changing or revoking any Tax election, adopting or
changing any Tax accounting method, changing any Tax accounting period,
settling or compromising any Tax Claim, or entering into any Tax allocation
agreement, Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity agreement or closing agreement
relating to any Tax, in each case for a Post-Closing Tax Period that has a
retroactive or retrospective effect on any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (B) any

in each case any such action (x) effected with the written consent of Seller
Parent (which consent shall include any consent of Seller Parent to filing any
Tax Return pursuant to Section 6.6(a), requesting a Tax refund pursuant to
Section 6.6(d) or settling any Tax Claim pursuant to Section 6.6(f), in each
case that clearly reflects such action), or (y) that is required by applicable
Law based on written reasoned advice of internationally recognized tax
counsel, which counsel may include an independent accounting firm, and which
counsel is reasonably acceptable to Seller Parent (any action covered by the
immediately preceding clause (A) or (B), a "Purchaser Tax Act"); and (iii)
Seller Parent shall not defend, indemnify or hold harmless Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries)
from any liability for, (A) any Transfer Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes,
(B) Taxes up to the aggregate amount of Taxes that constitute Assumed
Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.5(c) that are included as liabilities in the
Final Closing Statement, or (C) Taxes attributable to a breach by Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof of any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement.



ii.Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) shall defend, indemnify or hold harmless Seller Parent and its
Affiliates from and against, without duplication, all Tax liabilities (A) in
respect of the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries, the Purchased
Assets or the Business for any Post-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent
such Tax is an Excluded Tax), (B) for Transfer Taxes that are not Excluded
Taxes, (C) for any VAT payable by Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to
Section 6.6(i), (D) attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act, or (E) attributable
to any breach by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, with respect
to actions taken after the Closing, any Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) of any covenant in Section 6.6.



iii.In the case of any Straddle Period:



a.the periodic Taxes of the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries)
and, to the extent attributable to the Purchased Assets, the Asset 

b. Sellers that are not based on income or receipts (e.g., real property Taxes
and personal property Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed
based upon the ratio of the number of days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and



c.Taxes of the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) and, to the
extent attributable to the Purchased Assets, the Asset Sellers for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, other than Taxes described in Section 6.6(e)(iii)(A)
above, shall be computed as if such Tax period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes of the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) and the Asset Sellers attributable to
the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough"
entity, as if the Tax period of such partnership or other "flowthrough" entity
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.



iv.Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 6.6(e)
shall be made within thirty (30) days after the Party seeking indemnification
under this Section 6.6(e) (the "Tax Indemnified Party") makes written demand
upon the Party from whom indemnification is sought under this Section 6.6(e)
(the "Tax Indemnifying Party"), but in no case later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to
the applicable Taxing Authority.



v.Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for
all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price paid by Purchaser for
the relevant Conveyed Subsidiary or Purchased Asset, as the case may be,
unless otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law or a Final Determination
or as mutually agreed by the Parties. Each of the Parties shall notify the
other Parties if it receives notice that any Taxing Authority proposes to
treat any indemnification payment under this Agreement as other than an
adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes.



vi.The indemnification obligations of Seller Parent and Purchaser under this
Section 6.6(e) shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations; provided, that the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 4.16(i) and (n) and the indemnification
obligations of Seller Parent under Sections 6.6(e)(i) with respect to such
representations and warranties, shall terminate and expire on, and no action
or proceeding seeking damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for
any misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect thereto shall be commenced
after, the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that
such indemnification obligations or representations and warranties shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which Seller Parent or Purchaser, as
the case may 

vii. be, previously made a claim by delivering a written notice (stating in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to Purchaser or Seller Parent, as
the case may be.



f.Tax Contests.



i.If a Tax deficiency, proposed Tax adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax
examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or
other claim with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns shall be made by any Taxing
Authority (a "Tax Claim") which, if successful, might result in an indemnity
payment pursuant to Section 6.6(e), the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim (and provide copies
of any documents received from the Taxing Authority in respect of such claim)
no later than ten (10) Business Days after such Tax Claim is made, provided,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Tax Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder except (i) to the extent
the Tax Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby and
(ii) to the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was
not provided.



ii.With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
otherwise relating to, or affecting, a Consolidated Tax Return of Seller
Parent, Seller Parent shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel), and,
without limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund or contest the
Tax Claim; provided, however, that (A) if the resolution of such Tax Claim
could increase the Tax liability of, or reduce any Tax benefit available to,
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) for any Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller Parent shall (1) conduct
such Tax Claim diligently and in good faith, (2) consult in good faith with
Purchaser before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Claim that might adversely affect any Tax item of Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) for a Post-
Closing Tax Period, (3) consult in good faith with Purchaser and offer
Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to comment before submitting to any Taxing
Authority any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Tax Claim that might adversely affect any Tax item of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) for a
Post-Closing Tax Period, and (4) not settle, discharge, compromise, or
otherwise dispose ("Dispose") of such Tax Claim if doing so could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse consequence on any Tax item of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and
their Subsidiaries) for a Post-Closing Tax Period without obtaining the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (B) if 

Seller Parent does not assume the control of such Tax Claim, Purchaser shall
be entitled to control such Tax Claim at Seller Parent's sole expense, and
shall (1) conduct such Tax Claim diligently and in good faith, (2) consult in
good faith with Seller Parent before taking any significant action in
connection with such Tax Claim that might adversely affect any Tax item of
Seller Parent or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise increase the amounts
of indemnification for which Seller Parent is responsible pursuant to Section
6.6(e)(i), (3) consult in good faith with Seller Parent and offer Seller
Parent a reasonable opportunity to comment before submitting to any Taxing
Authority any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Tax Claim that might adversely affect any Tax item of Seller Parent or its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise increase the amounts of indemnification
for which Seller Parent is responsible pursuant to Section 6.6(e)(i), and (4)
not Dispose of such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of
Seller Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.



iii.Except as otherwise provided herein, Purchaser shall control all other
proceedings with respect to Tax Claims relating to Taxes of the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) or Taxes otherwise relating to the
Purchased Assets or the Business, provided, that, except with respect to Tax
Claims relating to Consolidated Tax Returns of Purchaser, Seller Parent shall
have the right to participate fully in all relevant aspects of such other
proceedings if the resolution of such proceedings could reasonably be expected
to materially increase the Tax liability of a Conveyed Subsidiary (or a
Subsidiary thereof) or the Business in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the amount
of indemnification for which Seller Parent is responsible pursuant to Section
6.6(e)(i) and in such case, Purchaser shall not Dispose of such Tax Claim
without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



iv.Purchaser, the Conveyed Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller Parent and its respective Affiliates,
on the other hand, shall cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which
cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request, the provision to
the requesting Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.
Purchaser and Seller Parent shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney
and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section
6.6(f). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Seller Parent
shall not be required to provide Purchaser with a copy, or otherwise disclose
the contents, of any Consolidated Tax Return of Seller Parent; provided,
however, that if such Tax Return relates to Purchaser's Tax liability for a
Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller Parent shall provide reasonable access to the
relevant information contained in such Tax Return to Purchaser (including, at
Seller Parent's sole 

discretion, by way of providing excerpted parts of such Tax Return, redacted
in the manner Seller Parent deems necessary) and (B) Purchaser shall not be
required to provide Seller Parent with a copy, or otherwise disclose the
contents, of any Consolidated Tax Return of Purchaser; provided, however, that
if such Tax Return relates to Seller Parent's Tax liability for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, Purchaser shall provide reasonable access to the relevant
information contained in such Tax Return to Seller Parent (including, at
Purchaser's sole discretion, by way of providing excerpted parts of such Tax
Return, redacted in the manner Purchaser deems necessary).



g.Internal Restructurings. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, effective from a
date on or prior to the Closing Date, to (i) implement the transactions
described in Schedule 4 hereto (provided that Seller Parent shall consult with
and consider in good faith the input of Purchaser on the timing, structure and
other details of such transactions) and (ii) otherwise restructure any
Conveyed Subsidiary, Asset Seller or Share Seller, including by transferring
any stock, assets, employee or other interests held by (or in) any Conveyed
Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof), Asset Seller or Share Seller as the case
may be (the "Internal Restructurings"); provided that Seller Parent shall not
engage in any Internal Restructuring described in clause (ii) without
obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood that it
would not be reasonable for Purchaser to withhold, condition or delay its
consent if such Internal Restructuring would not impair in any manner or have
any adverse impact on (x) the Business or the Purchased Assets or the
anticipated value to Purchaser of such Business or Purchased Assets (in a
manner more adverse than any impairment or impact that would have otherwise
resulted had the action or transaction been effected in accordance with the
transactions contemplated pursuant to clause (i) above), (y) the right and
ability of Purchaser and any applicable Purchaser Designated Affiliate to own
and operate the Business and the Purchased Assets following the Closing, or
(z) the ability of Seller Parent, the Share Sellers and the Asset Sellers to
consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



h.Transfer Tax. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all Transfer
Taxes shall be borne and paid equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Seller Parent, on the other hand, when due.



i.VAT.



i.Subject to Section 6.6(i)(ii) and except as otherwise provided in the Local
Implementing Agreements, any VAT payable with respect to the transfer of the
Shares or the Purchased Assets from the Share Sellers or Asset Sellers to
Purchaser or any Purchaser Designated Affiliate, as the case may be, shall be
payable by Purchaser or its Affiliates in addition to the purchase price
stated in such Local Implementing Agreement and Purchaser or its Affiliates
shall, subject to receipt from Seller Parent or such Share Seller or Asset
Seller of a valid VAT invoice, pay to Seller Parent or such Share Seller or
Asset Seller the amount of VAT payable in respect of 

that transaction (unless the transfer is subject to a reverse charge scheme in
line with Article 194 et seq. of the VAT Directive or, for non EU countries, a
Law to the same effect). If VAT is paid pursuant to the preceding sentence and
it is later determined by any Taxing Authority that the transfer of the Shares
or the Purchased Assets from a Share Seller or Asset Seller to Purchaser or
any Purchaser Designated Affiliate, as the case may be, is not subject to VAT
and, accordingly, a refund or credit in respect of such VAT is obtained by
Seller Parent, Share Seller or Asset Seller (or any member of any VAT group to
which Seller Parent, Share Seller or Asset Seller belongs), then Seller
Parent, Share Seller or Asset Seller (as relevant) shall, promptly upon
written demand made by Purchaser or Purchaser Designated Affiliate (as
relevant), repay to Purchaser or the Purchaser Designated Affiliate, as the
case may be, the amount of any such VAT that was refunded or in respect of
which credit was given by the relevant Taxing Authority. In the event of a
repayment of such VAT or in the event that the consideration for the relevant
taxable supply changes following a payment of VAT pursuant to Section
6.6(i)(i) (whether as a result of the operation of Section 2.10 or otherwise),
the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to issue such invoices
or credit notes or to make such payments or repayments of VAT as would
properly reflect the correct amount of VAT attributable to the relevant
taxable supply.



ii.The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to
determine, at least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing whether the
transfer of the Shares or the Purchased Assets from the Share Sellers or Asset
Sellers to Purchaser or any Purchaser Designated Affiliate, as the case may
be, meets the requirements for VAT exemption or zero-rating for VAT purpose as
the supply of a going concern, or pursuant to Article 44 of the VAT Directive,
or pursuant to any other applicable Law. If such requirements are met, then
the provisions of Section 6.6(i)(i) shall not apply and instead Seller Parent
and the applicable Share Seller or Asset Seller, as the case may be, and
Purchaser and its Affiliates, as the case may be, agree that the transaction
evidenced by such agreement is exempt or zero-rated (as applicable) for VAT
purposes. Such cooperation shall include the prompt provision of any
applicable VAT registration details of the Share Sellers, the Asset Sellers,
Purchaser, and the Purchaser Designated Affiliates, as needed, and other
relevant details for such exemption or zero-rating for VAT purposes. If it is
later determined by any Taxing Authority that the transfer of the Shares or
the Purchased Assets from a Share Seller or Asset Seller to Purchaser or any
Purchaser Designated Affiliate, as the case may be, is subject to VAT, the VAT
will, as between the relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller and Purchaser or
its Affiliates, as the case may be, be payable by Purchaser or its Affiliates
in addition to the purchase price stated in such Local Implementing Agreement
and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, promptly upon written demand made by
Seller Parent or such Share Seller or Asset Seller (such demand being
accompanied by, or taking the form of, a valid VAT invoice issued by such
Share Seller or Asset Seller to Purchaser or its Affiliates, as the case may
be), pay to Seller Parent or such Share Seller or Asset Seller, as the case
may be, the amount of VAT payable in respect of that transfer. 

j.Miscellaneous.



i.Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate (including
any Conveyed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof) to, take any action on the
Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, except as required by this Agreement or applicable Law or with
Seller Parent's consent.



ii.On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements and arrangements between
any Conveyed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof, on the one hand, and Seller
Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than any Conveyed Subsidiary or
Subsidiary thereof), on the other hand, shall be terminated effective as of
the close of business on the Closing Date and shall have no further effect for
any Tax period (whether past, present or future), and, after the Closing Date,
no additional payments shall be made thereunder with respect to any Tax
period, whether in respect of a redetermination of Liabilities for Taxes or
otherwise. Seller Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to
ensure that each such termination is effective in the manner described above.



iii.Each of Purchaser and Seller Parent shall provide the other with such
information and records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees
and agents available, as may reasonably be requested by such other Party in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any audit
or other proceeding relating to Taxes of the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries, the Purchased Assets or the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period. Purchaser shall, within the earlier to occur of
one hundred twenty (120) days after Seller Parent's year-end and one hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, prepare, or cause the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (and their Subsidiaries) to prepare, in either case in a manner
consistent with the Conveyed Subsidiaries' (and their Subsidiaries') past
practices, all Tax work paper preparation packages necessary to enable Seller
Parent to prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns that Seller Parent
is obligated to prepare, or cause to be prepared, under this Agreement. Except
as otherwise provided in this Section 6.6, Seller Parent shall not be required
to provide Purchaser with a copy of, or otherwise disclose the contents of,
any Consolidated Tax Return of Seller Parent, and Purchaser shall not be
required to provide Seller Parent with a copy of, or otherwise disclose the
contents of, any Consolidated Tax Return of Purchaser.



iv.From and after the date of this Agreement and to the earlier of the Closing
Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.1, at the request of Purchaser, Seller Parent shall reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser, at Purchaser's cost, in taking any actions needed in order to
preserve the validity of the Costa Rica Free Zone Exemption Grant described in
Section 4.16(i)(1) of the Seller Disclosure Letter and/or the Dominican
Republic Free Zone Exemption Grant described in Section 4.16(i)(2) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt that
nothing in this Section shall 

be construed as a representation or warranty of Seller Parent and its
Subsidiaries with respect to the continuing validity of such Dominican
Republic Free Zone Exemption Grant.



v.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for any and
all Tax matters and the procedures with respect thereto shall be governed
exclusively by this Section 6.6 and shall not be governed by the provisions of
Section 6.21 or Article VII, other than Section 7.5 (solely with respect to
any Tax for which indemnification is provided under Section 6.6(e)(i)(5) for a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.16(i) and
Section 4.16(n), and treating for purposes of Section 7.5 any such Tax as a
Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section 7.1(a)(iii)), Section
7.6 (treating for purposes of Section 7.6 (i) any Tax for which
indemnification is provided under Section 6.6(e) as a Loss for which
indemnification is provided under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 and (ii) the Tax
Indemnified Party and the Tax Indemnifying Party as an Indemnified Party and
an Indemnifying Party, respectively) and Section 7.9.



Section 6.7 Employees and Employee Benefits.



a.Business Employees - Offer of Continued Employment; Severance. Purchaser
agrees to continue employment as of 12:01 a.m. (local time wherever
applicable) on the Closing Date of each Business Employee (or to cause the
Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries to continue the employment of each
of their Business Employees). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, as of the Closing Purchaser, or the applicable Purchaser Designated
Affiliate, shall, to the extent required by applicable Law, assume the
Collective Bargaining Agreements and shall continue all terms and conditions
(including the terms and conditions of employment for covered Business
Employees) under such assumed Collective Bargaining Agreements through their
respective expiration, modification or termination in conformity with such
Collective Bargaining Agreements and applicable Law. Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall work together in good faith prior to the Closing to satisfy
any notice or consultation obligations to any labor union, labor organization,
or works council that may be triggered by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.7, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to the right
of any Business Employee (non-U.S.) of an Asset Seller employed in a
jurisdiction where the ARD applies to object to the transfer of his or her
employment pursuant to the ARD, the Parties expect the employment of any
Business Employee (non-U.S.) employed in such jurisdiction to transfer from
the relevant Asset Seller to the relevant Affiliate of Purchaser pursuant to
the ARD with effect from the Closing Date. The Parties will comply, and will
procure that their respective Affiliates will comply, with their obligations
pursuant to the ARD. Seller Parent will reasonably assist, and procure that
its Affiliates assist, Purchaser and its Affiliates in effecting the transfer
of employment of Business Employees (non-U.S.) of Asset Sellers to whom the
ARD does not apply to the Purchaser or its appropriate Affiliates effective as
of 12:01 am on the Closing Date.



b.Continued Employee Benefits. Subject and in addition to the requirements
imposed by the ARD or other applicable Law, commencing as of the Closing Date
and continuing through 

at least September 30, 2017, Purchaser agrees to provide, or to cause its
Affiliates to provide, the Transferred Employees while employed with (i) a
base salary or wage rate at least equal to the base salary or wage rate and
target bonus opportunity as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) employee benefit plans and arrangements including severance plans and
arrangements that are substantially comparable in the aggregate, and
individually with respect to severance plans and arrangements, (excluding
defined benefit pensions, retiree medical and equity compensation for this
purpose) to the employee benefit plans and arrangements and severance plans
and arrangements that are provided to the Business Employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date (disregarding the Plans set forth in Section 4.17(a)(ii)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter for this purpose). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed
to guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of
Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee for any
reason after the Closing Date.



c.Purchaser Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser shall assume the following
Liabilities, but excluding any Liabilities, in relation to an employee of
Seller Parent or its Affiliates who does not become a Transferred Employee as
of the Closing Date (other than as described in clause (iv) below): (i) in
each case, whether incurred prior to, on or following the Closing Date, under
the (A) Collective Bargaining Agreements but only if the Collective Bargaining
Agreements are required to be assumed by Law pursuant to Section 6.7(a) and
(B) Company Plans (including the Company Plans that have been set forth and
designated as such in Section 4.17(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, whether
or not material), (ii) each compensation or benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement, including all salaries or wages (including
commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime, premium pay, shift
differentials and severance pay) accruing after the Closing Date with respect
to the Transferred Employees, (iii) each compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement (including all salaries or wages,
commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime, premium pay, shift
differentials and severance pay) transferring by Law, and (iv) any severance
Liabilities incurred by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates as a result of
Purchaser's failure to offer employment to a Business Employee other than an
employee of the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries, and any other
Liabilities incurred by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates on or following
the Closing Date as a result of Purchaser and its Affiliates failing to comply
with the requirements of Section 6.7(a) and 6.7(b) or, with respect to the UK,
where the Business Employee objects to the transfer of his or her employment
to Purchaser pursuant to the ARD as a result of a substantial change in
working conditions to his or her material detriment (collectively, the
"Purchaser Assumed Employee Liabilities"). Purchaser agrees to reimburse
Seller Parent, as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days
of receipt of appropriate verification, for all costs and expenses (including
workers' compensation expenses) actually paid by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date as required by applicable Law or any
Contract, to the extent that the Liabilities are Purchaser Assumed Employee
Liabilities.



d.Seller Parent Retained Liabilities. Other than the Purchaser Assumed
Employee Liabilities, Seller Parent, or its applicable Affiliate, shall,
effective as of the Closing, retain or 

assume all Liabilities and obligations under or relating to each Business
Employee, Plan and each Foreign Plan and all Liabilities arising under or in
connection with any employee benefit program, plan or arrangement sponsored or
maintained by any ERISA Affiliate of any Seller.



e.Accrued Paid Time Off. Purchaser shall be responsible for and assume all
accrued but unused time off entitlements, including vacation days, for
Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date for their use consistent with
Seller Parent's policies in respect thereof (including with respect to carry
over entitlements). Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall credit
Transferred Employees with their vacation and/or paid time off benefits for
use by an employee in accordance with Purchaser's policies, taking into
account the Transferred Employees' past service credit as provided in Section
6.7(f).



f.Service Credit. Transferred Employees also shall be provided credit by
Purchaser for all service with Seller Parent and its Affiliates, to the same
extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Seller Parent and its
Affiliates and any predecessor employer, under (x) all employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and fringe benefits of Purchaser for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (and benefit accrual with respect to Purchaser's
vacation policies), and (y) severance plans, programs and policies for
purposes of calculating the amount of each such employee's severance benefits,
except to the extent that such recognition would result in the duplication of
benefits.



g.Welfare Plan Obligations. Commencing as of 12:01 a.m. (local time wherever
applicable) on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall include the Transferred
Employees in its welfare plans (or an applicable plan maintained by a Conveyed
Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof) and agrees to waive any waiting periods or
limitations for preexisting conditions under such welfare benefits plans
(including its medical, dental, life insurance, short-term and long-term
disability plans), and any other similar such plans, and shall ensure that
such employees are given credit for any amounts paid toward deductibles, out-
of-pocket limits or other fees on or prior to the Closing Date. Claims
incurred by a Transferred Employee for welfare benefit plan services rendered
as of 12:01 a.m. (local time wherever applicable) on the Closing Date shall be
the responsibility of the welfare benefit plan provided by Purchaser to such
employees. Claims incurred for welfare benefit plan services for Transferred
Employees rendered prior to and including the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of the welfare benefit plan of Seller Parent or an Affiliate
which covered such employees prior to and including the Closing Date.



h.Business Employees (U.S.) and Business Employees (non-U.S.) Absent on
Disability - Offer of Employment; Continued Employment.



i.When a Business Employee (other than any such employee employed by a
Conveyed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof that maintains the disability
program covering such employee and other than an employee whose employment
transfers by applicable Law) who is, on the Closing Date, absent as a result
of a short-term disability (including a disability in connection with
maternity leave), Purchaser, as appropriate, shall continue to employ or offer
immediate employment to such Business Employee in the same or a comparable
position to that which the Business Employee occupied before such absence.
Such employees on short-term disability leave, will be subject to the same
pay, benefits, severance and all other policies, plans, programs and
arrangements as stipulated in this Section 6.7 for similarly-situated Business
Employees. 

ii.Purchaser shall continue to employ or offer immediate employment to
Business Employees who are on disability leave (including short- and long-term
disability leave) and (A) who are employed by a Conveyed Subsidiary or
Subsidiary thereof that maintains the disability program covering such
employee or (B) whose employment transfers by applicable Law.

iii.Any Business Employee who is on long-term disability as of the Closing
Date (other than any such employee employed by a Conveyed Subsidiary or
Subsidiary thereof that maintains the disability program covering such
employee and other than an employee whose employment transfers by applicable
Law) shall not become a Transferred Employee hereunder and Seller Parent shall
retain all Liabilities in respect of such Business Employee.



i.401(k). Seller Parent shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities under
the Hospira 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the "Hospira 401(k) Plan") and the
Pfizer Savings Plan (the "Seller Parent 401(k) Plan") up to the Closing Date.
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser shall establish or maintain a defined
contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code that on or after the Closing Date shall cover
eligible Transferred Employees and accept a contribution, in cash and in kind
with respect to participant notes, to the extent attributable to any eligible
rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
of the benefit of a Transferred Employee under the Hospira 401(k) Plan or the
Seller Parent 401(k) Plan. Seller Parent shall cause each Transferred Employee
to be fully vested, as of the Closing, in his or her accrued benefit or
account balance under the Hospira 401(k) Plan and Seller Parent 401(k) Plan.



j.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser agrees
to pay, or to cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, a Conveyed
Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof) to pay, each Transferred Employee who is
bonus-eligible pursuant to an applicable plan or program maintained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates, his or her annual bonus for calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs at no less than target, pro-rated to reflect
time served with Seller Parent, Purchaser and/or their respective Affiliates
in such calendar year following the Closing Date, which bonus shall be paid at
the time that such annual bonus would normally have been paid had the Closing
not occurred. To the extent that the pro rata portion of the annual bonuses,
at target, that is attributable to service with Seller Parent or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing is paid out by Seller Parent, no accrual for
such amount will be credited to Working Capital.



k.No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained herein, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Business Employee or Transferred
Employee of Seller Parent or the Conveyed Subsidiaries (or Subsidiaries
thereof) any benefits under any benefit plans, programs, policies or other
arrangements, including severance benefits or right to employment or continued
employment with Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser for any period by
reason of this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of this Agreement, in
particular this Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no
current or former employee, director, or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and 

nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Plan, Foreign Plan or
other employee benefit plan for any purpose.

Section 6.9 Intercompany Accounts and Arrangements.



a.Seller Parent may take (or cause one or more of its Affiliates to take) such
action, in compliance with all applicable Laws, as is necessary or advisable
to settle, effective as of, or prior to, the Closing Date, all intercompany
accounts. Except for the Ancillary Agreements, all intercompany arrangements
and agreements, whether written or oral, between any Seller or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the Conveyed Subsidiaries
or their Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated and of no

Affiliates, hereby releases Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including
the Conveyed Subsidiaries and each Subsidiary thereof) and Affiliates (and
their respective officers, directors and employees, acting in their capacities
as such) from any Liability, obligation or responsibility to any of them for
any and all past actions or failures to take action prior to the Closing,
including any actions which may be deemed to have been negligent or grossly
negligent, relating to or arising out of Contracts, sales orders, purchase
orders, instruments and other commitments, obligations and arrangements with
Seller Parent, any Conveyed Subsidiary or a Subsidiary thereof or the
operation or conduct of any businesses, assets (including activities performed
thereat) or operations managed or operated by, or operationally related to,
directly or indirectly, to the Business or the Retained Businesses, except for
(i) any obligation pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and (ii) any agreements or arrangements of a commercial
nature entered into by and between the Purchaser and any of its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Seller Parent and any of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
not in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Except to the
extent provided to the contrary in Section 6.9(a), effective as of the
Closing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Subsidiaries and each Subsidiary thereof), hereby releases Seller
Parent and each of its Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors
and employees, acting in their capacity as such) from any Liability,
obligation or responsibility to any of them for any and all past actions or
failures to take action prior to the Closing, including any actions which may
be deemed to have been negligent or grossly negligent, relating to or arising
out of Contracts, sales orders, purchase orders, instruments and other
commitments, obligations and arrangements with Seller Parent or a Subsidiary
thereof or the operation or conduct of any businesses, assets (including
activities performed thereat) or operations managed or operated by, or
operationally related to, directly or indirectly, to the Business or the
Retained Businesses, or relating to or arising out of Seller Parent's or its
Affiliate's ownership of the Shares or any indebtedness of any Conveyed
Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) held by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, except for (i) any obligation pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) any agreements or arrangements
of a commercial nature entered into by and between the Purchaser and any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller Parent and any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand, not in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

Section 6.10 Access to Information.



a.Seller Parent and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall retain all
Information relating to the Business in their possession or control for at
least seven (7) years following the Closing Date or for such longer period as
may be required by Law or any applicable Governmental Order. Each Party shall
give at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the other Party before
ceasing to maintain any such Information, and each Party shall deliver to the
other Party upon request any copies of such Information that they have
proposed to no longer maintain.



b.Following the Closing and subject to applicable Law and the requirements of
Section 6.6, the Parties will allow each other and each other's accountants,
counsel and designated representatives reasonable access to such Information
of the Business and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or
contents thereof, for legitimate business reasons, including (i) to comply
with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the
requesting Party (including under applicable securities Laws) by any
Governmental Authority, including retention of Registration Information
(including in relation to pending applications for Product Registrations and
Manufacturing Registrations), (ii) to carry out its human resources functions
or to establish, assume or administer its benefit plans or payroll functions,
(iii) to prepare its financial statements or Tax Returns, or in order to
satisfy audit, accounting or other similar requirements, and (iv) in the
defense of any Action; provided, however, that this Section 6.10(b) shall not
require the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine.
Each Party shall be entitled to recover from the other its out-of-pocket costs
(including copying costs) incurred in providing such Information to the other
Party. The requesting Party will hold in confidence all Confidential
Information identified as such by, and obtained from, the disclosing Party or
any of its Representatives.



c.Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until the end of the
second (2nd) fiscal year following the year in which the Closing occurs (and
for a reasonable period of time afterwards as required for Purchaser to
prepare consolidated financial statements), each of the Parties shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, to cooperate with the other Party's
information requests to enable (i) the other Party to meet its timetable for
dissemination of its earnings releases, financial statements and management's
assessment of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and
its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Items 307 and
308, respectively, of Regulation S-K, and (ii) the other Party's accountants
to timely complete their review of the quarterly financial statements and
audit of the annual financial statements, including, to the extent applicable
to such Party, its auditor's audit of its internal control over financial
reporting and management's assessment thereof in accordance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC's and Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board's rules and auditing standards thereunder.



Section 6.11 Mail and Other Communications. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries and Purchaser and its Subsidiaries may
receive mail, packages and other communications properly belonging to the
other (or the other's Subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the
Closing Date, each of Seller Parent and Purchaser authorizes the other and
their respective Subsidiaries to receive and open all mail, packages and other
communications received by it and not unambiguously intended for any other
Party (or its Subsidiaries) or any other Party's (or its Subsidiaries')
officers or directors, and to 

retain the same to the extent that they relate to the business of the
receiving Party or, to the extent that they do not relate to the business of
the receiving Party, the receiving Party shall promptly deliver such mail,
packages or other communications (or, in case the same relate to both
businesses, copies thereof) to the other Party. The provisions of this Section
6.11 are not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an
authorization by either Seller Parent or Purchaser to permit the other to
accept service of process on its behalf and neither Party is or shall be
deemed to be the agent of the other for service of process purposes.



Section 6.12 Transfer of Business IP and Registrations.



a.Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and filing all instruments and
documents necessary to effect the assignment of the Business IP, MedNet
Rights, Product Registrations and Manufacturing Registrations to Purchaser and
its Affiliates, including all costs and expenses of preparing and recording
country-specific assignments and legalization of signatures (where required).
Subject to the foregoing, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the
foregoing as set forth in Section 6.5.



b.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, upon or prior to the Closing, upon Purchaser's reasonable request,
Seller Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate to deliver to Purchaser or its
designated Affiliate copies of all Business Patent Rights applications and
Business Trademark Rights applications and related files concerning
prosecution and maintenance, in each case to the extent in Seller Parent or
its Affiliates' possession or control and in the format maintained by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates as of such date (e.g., electronic or paper files),
and Product Registrations, Manufacturing Registrations, and related
applications, submissions and correspondence to or from the relevant
Governmental Authority via electronic submission or reputable carrier.
Following the delivery of such Product Registrations, Manufacturing
Registrations and the aforementioned related materials, Seller Parent and
Purchaser agree to notify the relevant Governmental Authorities of the
transfers of ownership of the Product Registrations from Seller Parent, its
Affiliate or the Representative to Purchaser or its designated Affiliate. Such
notifications to Governmental Authorities shall be in a format and with
content consistent with the applicable Law and/or guidance document on point
for the type of Product in question for the jurisdiction in question. Seller
Parent and Purchaser also agree to update Manufacturing Registrations or other
establishment and facility registration information with Governmental
Authorities to reflect the change in ownership of relevant establishments and
facilities from Seller Parent, its Affiliate or the Representative to
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate. Such updates to Governmental
Authorities shall be in a format and with content consistent with the
applicable Law and/or guidance document on point for the type(s) of medical
device, drug and/or food activities carried out at each establishment or
facility in question for the jurisdiction in question. Seller Parent and
Purchaser agree that aforementioned delivery of Product Registrations,
Manufacturing Registrations, and related applications, submissions and
correspondence to or from Governmental Authorities, and the aforementioned
notifications and updates, shall be made within any relevant timeframe
specified in the applicable Law for each jurisdiction in question.



c.Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare for the transfer of any applicable
Product Registrations to Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate or designee on or
after the Closing Date. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
Seller Parent and Purchaser shall each nominate one representative with
sufficient experience to coordinate, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, on behalf of each Party all regulatory matters relating to the transfer
or issuance of Product Registrations to Purchaser or a Purchaser's Affiliate
or designee for each applicable country.



d.Seller Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that, on the Closing Date, legal
title to the Product Registrations in certain countries may remain with Seller
Parent or its Affiliates or third party distributors due to the requirements
of applicable regulatory local Laws. Seller Parent and Purchaser further
acknowledge that, notwithstanding the foregoing until such time as the legal
title to the Product Registrations for such countries can be transferred to
(or issued in the name of) or assumed by Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate or
designee, Seller Parent or its Affiliates or third party distributors shall
(use their commercially reasonable efforts to) hold such Product Registrations
in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit and cost of Purchaser. Seller
Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to bear any third party cost
or expense in connection with the transfer or the issuance of any Product
Registration to Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate or designee, and such third
party costs will be borne solely by Purchaser.



Section 6.13 Resignations. To the extent requested in writing by Purchaser at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall
cause each director (or member of other appropriate corporate governing body)
of the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries for which such resignation
is so requested to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her
resignation as a director (or member of other appropriate corporate governing
body), but not in any other capacity, of such Conveyed Subsidiaries or such
Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, at, or effective as of, the Closing
Date.



Section 6.14 No Solicitation. For a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date, Seller Parent shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any Business Employees
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and
their Subsidiaries) to leave the employ of Purchaser or any such Affiliate for
employment with Seller Parent or its Affiliates, or violate the terms of their
contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Purchaser or any such
Affiliate, provided, that nothing in this Section 6.14 shall restrict or
preclude the rights of Seller Parent and its Affiliates from (i) soliciting or
hiring any employee who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement
that is not specifically targeted or directed at the Business Employees (and
nothing shall prohibit such generalized searches for employees through various
means, including the use of advertisements in the media (including trade
media) or the engagement of search firms to engage in such searches, or
posting searches on the internet) or (ii) soliciting or hiring any Business
Employee whose employment has been terminated by Purchaser (including through
a constructive termination, if applicable) or any of its Affiliates (including
the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries). It is the desire and intent
of the Parties that the provisions of this Section 6.14 shall be enforced to
the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in
each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any particular provisions
or portion of this Section 6.14 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or 

unenforceable, this Section 6.14 shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom
such provision or portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such
amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of this Section 6.14 in
the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. The Parties
recognize that the performance of the obligations under this Section 6.14 by
Seller Parent is special, unique and extraordinary in character, and that in
the event of the breach by Seller Parent or its Affiliates of the terms and
conditions of this Section 6.14 to be performed by Seller Parent, Purchaser
shall be entitled, if it so elects, to obtain damages for any breach of this
Section 6.14, or to enforce the specific performance thereof by Seller Parent.



Section 6.15 Non-Competition.



a.For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Seller Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, in
any country in which the Business is conducted on the date hereof and as of
immediately prior to the Closing, research, develop, test, use, store,
manufacture, market, commercialize, distribute, sell or service any product
that is the same as a Product (collectively, the "Seller Prohibited
Activities").



b.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that Seller Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be deemed to have violated the restrictions contained in
Section 6.15(a) in the event that Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
acquires or invests in:



i.any Person, or the assets thereof, if less than ten percent (10%) of the
gross revenues, assets and income of such Person or assets (based on such
Person's latest annual audited consolidated financial statements) are related
to or were derived from any of the Seller Prohibited Activities;



ii.any Person, or the assets thereof, if ten percent (10%) or more than ten
percent (10%) of the gross revenues, assets or income of such Person or assets
(based on such Person's latest annual audited consolidated financial
statements) were derived from any of the Seller Prohibited Activities;
provided, that Seller Parent and its Affiliates use reasonable best efforts to
divest themselves within twelve (12) months of such acquisition of all or
substantially all of the assets or operations so acquired that are engaged in
any of the Seller Prohibited Activities;



iii.securities representing not more than three percent (3%) of the
outstanding voting power of any Person; or



iv.any equity interest in any Person through any employee benefit plan of
Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries.



c.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that none of Seller Parent,
its Affiliates or any acquiring or surviving entity of a merger or
consolidation shall be deemed to have violated the restrictions contained in
Section 6.15(a) in the event that Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates is
acquired, directly or indirectly, by any Person engaged, directly or
indirectly, prior to the date of such acquisition, in any of the Seller
Prohibited Activities (it being understood and agreed that, in the case of an
acquisition, merger or other business combination with any such Person, Seller
Parent or any Affiliate 

thereof shall be deemed "acquired" only in the event that, following such
acquisition, merger or other business combination, fifty percent (50%) or more
of the outstanding voting stock of the acquired, surviving or combined entity
is owned, directly or indirectly, by Persons other than the shareholders of
Seller Parent or their respective Affiliates immediately prior to such
acquisition, merger or other business combination).



d.The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.15, the provisions of this Section 6.15 shall not prohibit Seller
Parent or any of its Affiliates from operating or conducting any of their
respective businesses or the Retained Businesses, performing under any
Ancillary Agreement, or owning or operating any Excluded Asset. It is the
desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Section 6.15
shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public
policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any
particular provisions or portion of this Section 6.15 shall be adjudicated to
be invalid or unenforceable, this Section 6.15 shall be deemed amended to
delete therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
this Section 6.15 in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made. The Parties recognize that the performance of the obligations under this
Section 6.15 by Seller Parent is special, unique and extraordinary in
character, and that in the event of the breach by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates of the terms and conditions of this Section 6.15 to be performed by
Seller Parent, Purchaser and the Business shall be entitled, if they so elect,
to obtain damages, expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses), losses
or liabilities of any nature and kind (without regard to any limitation on
types or measurement of damages in this Agreement including those set forth in
the definition "Loss" in Section 1.1 or Section 7.5) for any breach of this
Section 6.15, or to enforce the specific performance thereof by Seller Parent.



Section 6.16 Confidentiality.



a.For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall hold and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including
the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) to hold, and shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
hold, in strict confidence and not to use in any manner (other than for the
purpose of holding confidential and for no other purpose), disclose or release
without the prior written consent of the other Party, any and all of the other
Party's Confidential Information; provided, that the Parties may disclose, or
may permit disclosure of, Confidential Information (i) to their respective
Representatives who have a need to know such information and are informed of
their obligation to hold such information confidential to the same extent as
is applicable to the Parties and in respect of whose failure to comply with
such obligations, Seller Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, will be
responsible, (ii) if the Parties, their Affiliates or their respective
Representatives are requested or compelled to disclose, in the opinion of
counsel (which may be inside counsel), any such Confidential Information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law or any
securities exchange, market or automated quotation system to which such Person
is subject, (iii) in connection with any proceeding to enforce such Party's
rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (iv) in the case of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, to Purchaser's Financing Sources (and their
respective counsel, auditors and other professional advisors) so long as such
Persons are informed of the confidential nature of 

such information and agree to keep such information confidential.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for
disclosure of Confidential Information is made pursuant to clause (ii) above,
Seller Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall (x) to the extent
legally permissible and reasonably practicable, promptly notify the other
Party of the existence of such request or demand and the disclosure that is
expected to be made in respect thereto in each case with sufficient
specificity so that the other Party may, at its expense, seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions
of this Section 6.16 and (y) if requested by the other Party (at such other
Party's sole cost and expense), assist the other Party in seeking a protective
order or other appropriate remedy in respect to such request or demand. If
such a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the
other Party is not obtained and such disclosing Party or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is nonetheless required by such judicial or administrative
process, Law or securities exchange, market or automated quotation system to
disclose any Confidential Information, such disclosing Party (or such
Affiliate or Representative) may, after compliance with the immediately
preceding sentence of this Section 6.16(a), disclose only that portion of the
Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed, provided, that
such disclosing Party and, if appropriate, such Affiliate or Representative,
exercise its and their reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality
of such Confidential Information, including by obtaining reasonable assurances
that confidential treatment shall be accorded any Confidential Information so
disclosed. Notwithstanding any disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant
to clause (ii) above, such disclosing Party and its Affiliates and
Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of
confidentiality (including with respect to any Confidential Information
disclosed pursuant to clause (ii) above), non-disclosure, restriction on use
and other obligations under this Section 6.16.



b.As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all proprietary,
technical, economic, environmental, operational, financial or other business
information or material, data, reports, interpretations, forecasts and
business plans of one Party and its businesses, products, services, financial
condition, operations, assets, liabilities and/or prospects, which, prior to
or following the Closing Date, has been disclosed by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries), on the other hand, in written,
oral (including by recording), electronic, or visual form to, or otherwise has
come into the possession of, the other Party, in each case including pursuant
to the access provisions of Section 6.10 or any other provision of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (A) in the case of Seller Parent and
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (as the receiving party),
(i) except with respect to Intellectual Property, to the extent relating to
the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities prior to the
Closing and (ii) with respect to Intellectual Property, to the extent relating
solely to the Business or the Purchased Assets prior to Closing and not
constituting Excluded Assets, or (B) in the case of Purchaser and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (as the receiving party), to
the extent relating to the Excluded Assets or the Retained Businesses (except,
in the case of clauses (A) and (B), to the extent that such information can be
shown to have been (1) in the public domain (other than as a result of a
disclosure by such Party or its Affiliates or Representatives (including, in
the case of Seller Parent, any of the Retained Subsidiaries or, in the case of
Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and
their Subsidiaries))), (2) available after the date hereof to such Party on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the other Party without, to
such Party's knowledge after reasonable inquiry, being subject to any
contractual or other obligation of confidentiality to the other Party, or (3)
independently developed by or on behalf of such Party without use of,
reference to or reliance 

upon any information, materials or other documents furnished or otherwise
disclosed to such Party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives by or on
behalf of the other Party (as can be demonstrated by such Party by appropriate
documentary evidence) and is not, to such Party's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry, subject to any contractual or other obligation of confidentiality to
the other Party). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall prevent (x) Seller Parent or its Affiliates from
disclosing or using information (i) used or held for use in any Retained
Business or (ii) to the extent relating to any Retained Liability, in each
case, even if such information also constitutes Purchaser's Confidential
Information, and (y) Purchaser or its Affiliates from disclosing or using
information (i) used or held for use in the Business or (ii) to the extent
relating to any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities or the Business, in
each case, even if such information also constitutes Seller Parent's
Confidential Information.



c.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) Seller Parent
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder with
respect to Confidential Information if they exercise the same degree of care
(but no less than a reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve
confidentiality for their own similar information, materials or other
documents and (ii) confidentiality obligations provided for in any agreement
between Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and any employee of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (or,
prior to the Closing Date, any Conveyed Subsidiary and their Subsidiaries), or
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing Date, the
Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall remain
in full force and effect. Confidential Information of Seller Parent and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in the possession of, and used by, the other
Party as of the Closing Date may continue to be used by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates in the operation of their businesses, or subject to the
Intellectual Property License Agreement, Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) solely in the
operation of the Business, as the case may be, provided that, and to the
extent, such Confidential Information (i) in the possession of Seller Parent
or its Affiliates relates to the Retained Business, and (ii) in the possession
of Purchaser or its Affiliates relates to the Business and does not constitute
any Excluded Assets, and, in each case, so long as the Confidential
Information is maintained in confidence and not disclosed in violation of this
Agreement. Such continued right to use may not be transferred to any third
party (other than an Affiliate of a Party), without the prior written consent
of the other Party, unless the third party purchases all or substantially all
of the business and assets in one transaction or in a series of related
transactions for which or in which the relevant Confidential Information is
used or employed.



d.Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.16, to the extent that an
Ancillary Agreement or another Contract pursuant to which a Party is bound,
provided, that certain Confidential Information shall be maintained
confidential on a basis that is more protective of such Confidential
Information or for a longer period of time than provided for in this Section
6.16, then the applicable provisions contained in such Ancillary Agreement or
other Contract shall control with respect thereto. After the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated by the
parties thereto and shall no longer be in effect. 

Section 6.17 Guarantees; Letters of Credit.



a.Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate and
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to terminate, or
cause Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for
Seller Parent or the applicable Retained Subsidiary in respect of, all
obligations of Seller Parent or any of the Retained Subsidiaries under Seller
Parent Guarantees on the Closing Date.



b.With respect to any Seller Parent Guarantees that remain outstanding after
the Closing Date, (i) Seller Parent and Purchaser shall continue to cooperate
and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to terminate, or
cause Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for
Seller Parent or any Retained Subsidiary in respect of, all obligations under
Seller Parent Guarantees, (ii) Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and
against any Losses arising from, or relating to, such Seller Parent
Guarantees, and (iii) Purchaser shall not permit any Conveyed Subsidiary or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (a) renew or extend the term of or
(b) increase its obligations under, or transfer to another third party, any
loan, Contract or other obligation for which Seller Parent or any Retained
Subsidiary is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under such Seller
Parent Guarantee. To the extent that Seller Parent or the Retained
Subsidiaries have performance obligations under any Seller Parent Guarantee,
Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) perform such
obligations on behalf of Seller Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries or (y)
otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by Seller Parent so as to
put Seller Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries in the same position as if
Purchaser, and not Seller Parent or a Retained Subsidiary, had performed or
were performing such obligations.



c.Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate and
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace all letters of
credit issued by Seller Parent or the Retained Subsidiaries on behalf of or in
favor of any Conveyed Subsidiary, any of their Subsidiaries or the Business
(the "Seller Parent LCs") as promptly as practicable with letters of credit
from Purchaser or (if it is able to do so) one of its Affiliates as of the
Closing Date. With respect to any Seller Parent LCs that remain outstanding
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i) defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns for any Losses
arising from, or relating to, such letters of credit, including any fees in
connection with the issuance and maintenance thereof and (ii) without the
prior written consent of Seller Parent, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall
not, and shall not permit any Conveyed Subsidiary or any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to, enter into, renew or extend the term of, increase its
obligations under, or transfer to a third party, any loan, lease, Contract or
other obligation in connection with which Seller Parent or any Retained
Subsidiary has issued any letters of credit which remain outstanding. The
Parties agree that neither Seller Parent nor any of the Retained Subsidiaries
will have any obligation to renew any letters of credit issued on behalf of
any Conveyed Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary thereof) or the Business after the
expiration of any such letter of credit. Neither Seller Parent Guarantees nor
Seller Parent LCs shall be deemed Purchased Assets hereunder.



Section 6.18 Ancillary Agreements; Retained Names; the MedNet Mark; Common Law
Trademarks.



a.At the Closing, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall enter into, execute and
deliver a Transitional Services Agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit F
hereto, with such changes, if any, as may be mutually agreed by Purchaser and
Seller Parent (the "Transitional Services Agreement"), including the changes
contemplated to be negotiated pursuant to this Section 6.18(a). The Parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the schedules to the Transitional Services
Agreement set forth on Exhibit F hereto may not include all of the services
that shall be provided under the Transitional Services Agreement and prior to
Closing, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to supplement (as
applicable), negotiate in good faith and finalize the schedules to the
Transitional Services Agreement based on the discussions of the parties to
date and the description of the services and related terms set forth in the
draft of the schedules to the Transitional Services Agreement set forth on
Exhibit F hereto; provided that, for clarity, if, despite such reasonable best
efforts, the Parties are not able to agree in writing on any service to be
supplied thereunder, the Transitional Services Agreement shall include only
services that are both being utilized in connection with, the Business during
the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing and being performed by or
through employees, assets or entities of the Sellers that will not be
transferred to Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, and
shall not include the "Excluded Services" set forth on draft Exhibit B to the
Transitional Services Agreement (the "Services").



b.At the Closing, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall enter into, execute and
deliver (i) a shareholders agreement substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit B hereto (the "Shareholders Agreement"), (ii) an Intellectual Property
License Agreement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit G hereto (the
"Intellectual Property License Agreement"), (iii) a manufacturing and supply
agreement in which Seller Parent is the supplier substantially in the form set
forth in Exhibit H hereto (the "Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (Seller
Parent as Supplier)"), (iv) a manufacturing and supply agreement in which
Purchaser is the supplier substantially set forth in Exhibit I hereto (the
"Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (Purchaser as Supplier)"), (v)
Intellectual Property assignment agreements, substantially in the form set
forth in Exhibit J hereto (the "IP Assignment Agreements") and (vi) a
Logistics and Services Agreement, subject to the terms set forth in Section
6.26.



c.After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller Parent and Purchaser
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to assess the
feasibility of any potential delayed transfers of certain Business Employees
and certain assets located at the Pleasant Prairie Customer Service Center and
the three (3) distribution centers of the Business and, to agree to delay
transfers of such Business Employees and assets as reasonably requested by the
Purchaser.



d.As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause each Conveyed Subsidiary (and
each Subsidiary thereof) to change its name and cause its certificate of
incorporation (or equivalent organizational document), as 

applicable, to be amended to remove any and all references to "Hospira,"
"Pfizer" and all other Retained Names. Upon and following the Closing,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and each Subsidiary thereof) to, cease holding themselves out as
having any affiliation with Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates.



e.Upon and following the Closing, subject to Section 6.18(d), Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and each
Subsidiary thereof) to, cease using any and all Retained Names, except for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing (provided such period
shall be thirty (30) months with respect to use of the Retained Names, to the
extent required by use of tooling that is installed in the Austin Facility as
of the Closing, solely with respect to the Products that are manufactured in
the Austin Facility (i.e., bags)), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to use the Hospira Marks in the manner such Hospira Marks were used
by Seller Parent and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing solely in
connection with the sale of any Inventory of Products and use of the
advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials Relating to the
Business that, in each case, are included in the Purchased Assets under
Section 2.2(m) and contain such Hospira Marks as of the Closing, in the
conduct of the Business as conducted immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, that, with respect to any Product for which any Hospira Mark is
required to be used by any Conveyed Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries or
Purchaser or any Purchaser Designated Affiliate under a Product Registration
or Manufacturing Registration, such Person shall be permitted to continue to
use such Hospira Mark in the country to which such Product Registration or
Manufacturing Registration relates, including for the sale of any Inventory or
Products manufactured during such 18-month period (or thirty (30) month
period, as applicable), subject to and in accordance with this Section
6.18(e), to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with such Product
Registration or Manufacturing Registration, and to sell any inventory of
Product that is subject to such Product Registration or Manufacturing
Registration; provided, further, that, if Purchaser has been diligent in its
efforts to transition from such Hospira Mark to different Trademarks not
containing or comprising any of the Retained Names, but due to delays of the
applicable Governmental Authority in such country, and other delays that
Purchaser is not able to overcome by exercising diligent efforts, in each
case, that are outside Purchaser's reasonable control, use of such Hospira
Mark is required under the applicable Product Registration or Manufacturing
Registration, then following expiration of such 18-month period (or 30-month
period, as applicable), Purchaser may extend such period with respect to such
Hospira Mark and such country for additional period not to exceed one (1) year
until such Hospira Mark is no longer required to be used under the applicable
Product Registration or Manufacturing Registration, so long as Purchaser (x)
provides Seller Parent with prior written notice that describes the reason for
each such extension in reasonable detail, (y) remains diligent with respect to
such transition during each such extension and (z) such Hospira mark is
required to be used under the applicable Product Registration or Manufacturing
Registration. For clarity, after expiration of the 18-month period or 30-month
period (as applicable) or any extension thereof with respect to a Product,
Purchaser shall be permitted to continue selling any reasonable quantities of
inventory of such Product that exists as of the expiration of such period of
time for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed three (3) months);
provided that Purchaser provides Seller Parent with prior written notice
thereof and otherwise complies with the terms of this Section 6.18.



f.As of the Closing or with respect to each Hospira Mark, following the
expiration of each period of permitted use to the extent set forth in, and
subject to, Section 6.18(d) (each such period of permitted use for each
Hospira Mark with respect to the applicable country, the "Hospira Transition
Period"), Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to remove, strike
over, or otherwise obliterate all Retained Names from all sales and product
literature, vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging
materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites,
email addresses, computer software, and other materials and systems. Any use
of the Hospira Marks by the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries as
permitted in this Section 6.18 is subject to their use of each Hospira Mark in
the same form and manner, to the same extent (without an increase in extent or
type of uses of each Hospira Mark) and subject to the same standards of
quality, of that in effect for each Hospira Mark as of the Closing. Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, use any Hospira Mark in any
manner that may reflect negatively in any material respect on such name and
mark or on Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, in connection with all written Trademark uses of the
Hospira Marks permitted hereunder, use commercially reasonable efforts to
include a clear statement that the associated products or services are
manufactured by or otherwise emanate from Purchaser and its Affiliates and not
from Seller Parent and its Affiliates. Without limitation to any other rights
or remedies, Seller Parent shall have the right to terminate the license to
the Hospira Marks set forth herein, effective immediately, if Purchaser and
its Affiliates materially fail to comply with the foregoing terms and
conditions set forth in Sections 6.18(d) and 6.18(e) or otherwise materially
fail to comply with any reasonable direction of Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates in relation to the use of the Hospira Marks provided by Seller
Parent to Purchaser from time to time, and Seller Parent provides written
notice to Purchaser of such failure and Purchaser does not cure such failure
within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice. Purchaser shall not be
deemed to have violated this Section 6.18(f) by its retention of any archived
documentation or other tangible or electronic materials that contain any
Retained Names; provided that such documentation and materials are for
internal use only and not used in commerce.



g.From and after the Closing, Seller Parent agrees, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates, to cease all the use of the Hospira Marks that include the term
"MedNet" as a Trademark and upon request from Purchaser to cancel the existing
U.S. Trademark Registration Numbers 3341557, 3005020, 3600063, and 3399021.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time following the Closing Date,
Seller Parent would like to allow any such Trademark registrations to lapse or
be cancelled, Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser with written notice
thereof and if Purchaser would like Seller Parent to continue to maintain such
Trademark registrations, Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller Parent with
written notice agreeing to reimburse Seller Parent for its costs and expenses
incurred in connection with maintaining such Trademark registrations.
Following receipt of such notice, Seller Parent shall continue to maintain
such Trademarks for a reasonable period of time for so long as Purchaser
reimburses Seller Parent for such costs and expenses and remains diligent with
respect to filing Trademark applications (that, for clarity, do not include
any Retained Names) to replace such Trademark registrations. Seller Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby assigns to Purchaser any and all
of its and its Affiliates' right, title and interest in, to and under all
MedNet Rights. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE MEDNET RIGHTS IS DELIVERED ON AN "AS IS,"
"WHERE IS" BASIS AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDNET 

RIGHTS (INCLUDING SELLER PARENT'S OR ITS AFFILIATES' RIGHTS, IF ANY, WITH
RESPECT THERETO).



h.During the two (2) year period following the Closing, if and to the extent
that Purchaser identifies a common law Trademark owned by Seller Parent or any
of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date and that is necessary
for the operation of the Business as of the Closing Date and is not a Business
Common Law Trademark or a Retained Name, Purchaser may provide written notice
to Seller Parent identifying such common law Trademark and requesting that it
be licensed or assigned to Purchaser. The Parties shall review and discuss in
good faith such proposal for a period of up to sixty (60) days from the
receipt of such notice. If Seller Parent agrees in writing (such agreement not
to be unreasonably withheld) during such sixty (60) day period that such
applicable common law Trademark is necessary for the operation of the Business
as of the Closing Date, such common law Trademark (the "Omitted Trademark")
shall be licensed or assigned (in the reasonable discretion of Seller Parent)
to Purchaser and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
other terms as reasonably agreed to by the Parties.



Section 6.19 Compliance with WARN and Similar Laws. Seller Parent shall
provide to Purchaser at the Closing Date a complete and accurate list of all
"employment losses" within the Business, as that term is defined in WARN which
occurred in the ninety (90)-days preceding the Closing Date, which shall show
the name, date of separation, reason for separation, and facility or operating
unit of each employee of the Business who suffered such an employment loss in
such period. Purchaser agrees to provide or cause to be provided any required
notice under WARN, and any similar applicable Law, and otherwise to comply
with any such applicable Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" or similar event affecting Business Employees and occurring on or
after the Closing Date. Seller Parent agrees to, and shall cause the other
Sellers to, provide or cause to be provided any required notice under WARN,
and any similar applicable Law, and otherwise to comply with any such
applicable Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or similar
event affecting Business Employees and occurring prior to the Closing Date.



Section 6.20 Local Implementing Agreements. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall cause the
Local Implementing Agreements to be prepared and, at or prior to the Closing
Date, executed by the applicable Sellers and Purchaser Designated Affiliates.
Seller Parent and Purchaser agree that such Local Implementing Agreements
shall not expand or limit the rights and obligations of the Sellers, on the
one hand, and Purchaser and the Purchaser Designated Affiliates, on the other
hand, beyond those provided for in this Agreement, and that the Local
Implementing Agreements shall not provide for any additional rights or
obligations of the Sellers, Purchaser or the Purchaser Designated Affiliates
that are not provided for in this Agreement. Seller Parent and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the preparation of such Local Implementing Agreements, which
shall be prepared substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A with only
such changes as necessary to comply with applicable Law of such foreign
jurisdictions. In the event of any conflict between the terms of such Local
Implementing Agreements and this Agreement, Seller Parent and Purchaser agree
and acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement shall control and that, if
necessary, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, deliver such additional instruments as may be necessary to 

accomplish the foregoing. To the extent of any schedules to any such Local
Implementing Agreements, the Parties agree that such schedules shall be
provided for convenience only and, as applicable, to satisfy requirements of
applicable Law.



Section 6.21 Litigation Support; Seller Parent's Election to Control Non-
Indemnified Claims.



a.Following the Closing, except in connection with any indemnification claim
or dispute arising hereunder, Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Seller Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall cooperate with
each other in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities or Actions
involving the Business or Retained Businesses for which the other Party has
responsibility under this Agreement, including with respect to any Assumed
Liabilities or Retained Liabilities, by providing the other Party and such
other Party's legal counsel, upon reasonable advance notice in writing,
reasonable access, during regular normal business hours, to current and former
officers, directors, employees, contractors, records, documents, data,
equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes and other information
regarding the Business or Retained Businesses, as applicable, and its
respective products as such other Party may reasonably request, to the extent
maintained or under the possession or control of the requested Party;
provided, that all requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.21 shall be
made in writing and shall be directed to and coordinated with a Person or
Persons designated by the requested Party in writing; provided, however, that
no such access shall unreasonably interfere with Purchaser's and the Conveyed
Subsidiaries' (and their Subsidiaries') or Seller Parent's and its
Subsidiaries; as applicable, operation of their respective businesses,
including the Business and the Retained Businesses; and provided, further,
that the requested Party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
(A) in the reasonable judgment of such Party, applicable Law requires such
Party to restrict or prohibit access to such information or document, (B) in
the reasonable judgment of such Party, such information or document is subject
to confidentiality obligations to a third party, (C) such disclosure would
result in disclosure of any proprietary confidential information of such Party
or third parties, or (D) disclosure of any such information or document could
result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other applicable
privilege (provided, that such Party and/or counsel for such Party shall use
their reasonable best efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or
other arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a
manner that does not result in the loss of such privilege). The requesting
Party shall reimburse the other Party for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses paid to third parties in performing its obligations under this
Section 6.21.



b.From and after the Closing, (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall promptly
notify Seller Parent of any third party Action with respect to the Business
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect any Retained Business or
may affect, in whole or in part, any Retained Liability and (ii) Seller Parent
and its Affiliates shall promptly notify Purchaser of any third party Action
with respect to any Retained Business that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Business or may affect, in whole or in part, any Assumed
Liability; provided, that the failure by any Party and its Affiliates to give
any such notice shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement
other than an intentional failure to provide such notice. The provisions of
Article VII shall apply to any Third Party Claim with respect to which
Purchaser is entitled to indemnification by Seller Parent under Section 7.1. 

With respect to any other third party Action (a "Non-Indemnified Claim"), (A)
if such Non-Indemnified Claim could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
any Retained Business or affect, in whole or in part, any Retained Liability,
Seller Parent shall have the right but not the obligation, at its option, to
participate in the defense, compromise or settlement of such Non-Indemnified
Claim and, at its own expense, to employ counsel of its own choosing for such
purpose, and (B) if such Non-Indemnified Claim could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Business or affect, in whole or in part, any Purchased
Asset or Assumed Liability, Purchaser shall have the right but not the
obligation, at its option, to participate in the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Non-Indemnified Claim and, at its own expense, to employ
counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.



c.In furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, Seller
Parent and Purchaser shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
use, reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon written request,
its current and former officers, directors, employees, contractors, personnel
and agents for fact finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to
the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required in connection with
any Actions in which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved
arising from, or relating to, the conduct of the Business or the Retained
Businesses or with respect to any Assumed Liabilities or Retained Liabilities.
Seller Parent and Purchaser agree to reimburse each other for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses (other than officers' or employees' salaries) incurred by
the other in connection with providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to
this Section 6.21(c).



d.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) Seller Parent or any
Affiliate designated by Seller Parent shall have exclusive authority and
control over all aspects of any investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal
of any and all Actions arising solely from, or solely relating to, the
Retained Businesses or the Retained Liabilities and may negotiate, settle or
compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any
Retained Liability, without the consent of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof,
and (ii) Purchaser or any Affiliate designated by Purchaser shall have
exclusive authority and control over all aspects of any investigation,
prosecution, defense and appeal of any and all Actions arising solely from, or
solely relating to, the Purchased Assets, the Shares, the Assumed Liabilities
or the Business and may negotiate, settle or compromise, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, any of the Purchased Assets, the
Shares, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business, without the consent of Seller
Parent or any Affiliate thereof.



Section 6.22 Insurance. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
Purchaser, to the extent in its possession, (i) all loss history for the last
5 years relating to the Business for matters that have been self-insured by
Seller Parent and (ii) all pending insurance claims and the claims history for
the Sellers in respect of the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities during the five (5) years prior to the date hereof. From and after
the Closing Date, the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries shall cease
to be insured by Seller Parent or its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any
of their self-insured programs, and, except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries shall have any
access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds)
to cover any assets of the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries or any
Liability arising from the operation of the Business before, on or after the
Closing. Seller Parent or any of their respective Affiliates may, to be
effective at the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner it deems
appropriate to give effect to this Section 6.22. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all insurance it considers
appropriate for its operation of the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries and the Business. Seller Parent shall keep or cause its
Affiliates to keep all insurance policies currently maintained with respect to
the Business, or suitable 

replacements or renewals, in full force and effect through 12:01 a.m. (New
York time) on the Closing Date. Until the Closing, the Purchased Assets shall
remain at the risk of Seller Parent and its Affiliates. In the event of any
material damage to or destruction of any Purchased Asset (other than normal
wear and tear) after the date hereof and prior to the Closing (in any such
case, an "Insurable Loss"), Seller Parent shall give notice thereof to
Purchaser. If any such Insurable Loss is covered by property insurance
policies, all right and claim of Seller Parent or its Affiliates, to the
extent made prior to the Closing and included in the calculation of current
assets in Working Capital, to any proceeds of property insurance for such
Insurable Loss shall be assigned and (if previously received by Seller Parent
or its Affiliates and not used prior to the Closing Date to repair any damage
or destruction) paid to Purchaser at the Closing.

Section 6.23 Trade Notification. Seller Parent and Purchaser shall agree on
the method and content of the notifications to customers, suppliers and
distributors of the Business of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Closing Date. Seller Parent and Purchaser agree that
such notifications are to provide sufficient advance notice of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the plans associated therewith, with the
objective of minimizing any disruption of the Business.



Section 6.24 Accounts; Products Received.



a.All payments and reimbursements received by Seller Parent or its Affiliates
in connection with, or arising out of, the Purchased Assets, the Shares or the
Assumed Liabilities after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust
for the benefit of Purchaser and, promptly following receipt by such Person of
any such payment or reimbursement, such Person shall pay over to Purchaser the
amount of such payment or reimbursement, without right of set-off. All
payments and reimbursements received by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries
(including the Conveyed Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries) in connection
with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Retained Liabilities or Retained
Businesses, after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust for the
benefit of Seller Parent and, immediately upon receipt by such Person of any
such payment or reimbursement such Person shall pay over to Seller Parent the
amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of set-off.



b.If Products are received by Seller Parent or its Affiliates after the
Closing, Seller Parent shall or shall cause such Affiliate to ship those
Products to Purchaser, or Purchaser's stated representative, at Purchaser's
cost. Subject to Article VII, Purchaser shall have sole responsibility for
accepting and processing all returns following the Closing of Products and
disbursing refunds and credits in respect thereof (whether such Products was
sold prior to or after the Closing Date). Subject to Article VII, within
thirty (30) days after notification from Seller Parent or one of its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall reimburse such Seller Parent or one of its
Affiliates for all customer claims made against such Seller



Parent or one of its Affiliates in the form of invoice deductions for amounts
associated with such returned Products which are received by such Seller
Parent or one of its Affiliates or their agent after the Closing.



Section 6.25 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.



a.If the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall and shall cause the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries to take any necessary actions to provide
that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing
in favor of any current or former officers, directors, partners, members,
managers or employees of the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries (or
their respective predecessors) (collectively, the "DandO Indemnitees"), as
provided in the organizational documents of the Conveyed Subsidiaries and
their Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full
force and effect and be honored by the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their
Subsidiaries after the Closing.



b.In the event that the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries or
Purchaser or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries
or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.25.



c.The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 6.25 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom
this Section 6.25 applies without the express written consent of such affected
DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.25 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.25).



Section 6.26 Shared Contracts. (a) The Parties acknowledge that the Shared
Contracts relate to both the Business and the Retained Business. Following the
Closing, the Parties desire to have and obtain the rights and benefits under
each Shared Contract to the extent related to the Retained Businesses and the
Business. For the avoidance of doubt, the separation of any Shared Contracts
shall not be a condition to the Closing. The Parties shall bear their own out-
of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in connection with separating any such
Shared Contracts; provided, that the Parties shall not be required to commence
any litigation or offer to grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any counterparty to any such Shared Contract.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall enter into, execute and
deliver an agreement or agreements and/or shall include in one or more other
Ancillary Agreements provisions, in each case in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to each Party (such separate agreement or agreements, and/or such
provisions to be included in one or more other Ancillary Agreements, the
"Logistics and Services Agreement") as more fully described in and pursuant to
the provisions of Section 6.26 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.



Section 6.27 Return of Assets; Transfer of Purchased Assets.



a.If, at any time after the Closing, any asset acquired by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Subsidiaries) hereunder is ultimately
determined to be an Excluded Asset or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
found subject to a Retained Liability, (i) Purchaser shall return or transfer
and convey (without further consideration) to the appropriate Affiliate of
Seller Parent such Excluded Asset or Retained Liability; (ii) Seller Parent
shall cause its appropriate Affiliate to assume (without further
consideration) any Liabilities associated with such Excluded Assets or
Retained Liabilities; and (iii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
appropriate Affiliate to, execute such documents or instruments of conveyance
or assumption and take such further acts which are reasonably necessary or
desirable to effect the transfer of such Excluded Asset or Retained Liability
back to such Affiliate of Seller Parent, in each case such that each Party is
put into the same economic position as if such action had been taken on or
prior to the Closing Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser or its
Affiliate shall cause the Conveyed Subsidiaries to promptly pay or deliver to
Seller Parent (or its designee) any monies or checks which have been sent to a
Conveyed Subsidiary to the extent they are not due to the Business which
should have been sent to Seller Parent or one of its Affiliates (other than
the Conveyed Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries) (including promptly
forwarding invoices or similar documentation to Seller Parent). In the case of
any asset that is ultimately determined to be a Purchased Asset but is
required for the Retained Businesses, then the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries are
granted access or rights to such assets to the extent required for the
Retained Businesses.



b.Subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.3, if, at any time after the Closing, any
asset held by Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries is ultimately determined to be
a Purchased Asset or Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is found to be
subject to an Assumed Liability, (i) Seller Parent shall return or transfer
and convey (without further consideration) to the appropriate Conveyed
Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) or Purchaser Designated Affiliate such
Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability; (ii) Purchaser shall cause the
appropriate Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) or Purchaser
Designated Affiliate to assume (without further consideration) any Liabilities
associated with such Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities; and (iii)
Purchaser shall cause the appropriate Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary
thereof) or Purchaser Designated Affiliate to execute such documents or
instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts which are
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such Purchased
Asset or Assumed Liability to the Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof)
or Purchaser Designated Affiliate, in each case such that each Party is put
into the same economic position as if such action had been taken on or prior
to the Closing Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller Parent shall
promptly pay or deliver to the Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) or
Purchaser Designated Affiliate (or any designee of the foregoing) any monies
or checks which have been sent to Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by
customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the Business in respect
of the Business and which should have been sent to one of the Conveyed
Subsidiaries (or a Subsidiary thereof) or a Purchaser Designated Affiliate
(including promptly forwarding invoices or similar documentation to the
appropriate Conveyed Subsidiary (or Subsidiary thereof) or Purchaser
Designated Affiliate). In the case of any asset that is ultimately determined
to be an Excluded Asset but is required for the Business, 

then the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are granted access or rights to such assets to
the extent required for the Business.



Section 6.28 Financing.



a.Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Financing on
and in accordance with the terms and conditions (including the "flex"
provisions) contemplated by the Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, including (i) complying with and
maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiating and entering
into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter so that such agreements are in effect no later than the Closing, (iii)
satisfying as promptly as practicable and on a timely basis all the conditions
to the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements, (iv) accepting to the fullest extent all "market flex"
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements and (v)
enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by
the Financing Sources that impedes or delays the Closing. In the event that
all conditions to the Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding
shall be satisfied, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such
financing to fund on the Closing Date the financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including by taking enforcement action to
cause such lenders and the other Persons providing such financing to fund such
financing). Purchaser shall give Seller Parent prompt written notice of any
(A) breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive
document related to the Financing, (B) actual or threatened withdrawal,
repudiation or termination of the Financing by the Financing Sources, (C)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties to the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing, (D)
material amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Commitment Letter,
(E) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be
able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the
definitive documents related to the Financing or (F) expiration or termination
of the Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall keep Seller Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, including providing copies of all
definitive agreements. Neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall amend,
modify or agree to any waiver under the Commitment Letter without the prior
written approval of Seller Parent if such amendment, modification, or waiver
(1) could reasonably be expected to reduce (or have the effect of reducing)
the aggregate committed amount of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Financing (unless
in connection with such increase in the amount of the fees or original issue
discount, the aggregate amount of the Financing is increased in an amount
equal to such increase in the amount of the fees or original issue discount))
or (2) expands on or imposes new or additional conditions precedent, or
otherwise amends, modifies or expands any provision set forth therein in a
manner that could reasonably be expected to (x) prevent, delay or impair the
Closing, (y) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur, or (z) adversely
impact the ability of Purchaser or its Affiliates to enforce its rights
against the other 

parties to the Commitment Letter or the ability of Purchaser or its Affiliates
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that
Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) amend the Commitment Letter to
add commercial banks, investment banks or other institutional investors as
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
with commitments thereunder that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date hereof, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or
in the aggregate, would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the
Financing or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall, without the prior
written consent of Seller Parent, take any action or enter into any
transaction that would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent
consummation of all or any portion of the Financing. Purchaser shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under
the Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an
individual lender under the terms of, or in connection with, the syndication
of the Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the Commitment
Letter. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable, or it becomes reasonably likely that such
funds may become unavailable to Purchaser on the terms and conditions set
forth therein, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event to (aa) notify Seller
Parent in writing thereof, (bb) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
substitute financing on terms and subject to conditions not materially less
favorable to Purchaser and its Affiliates than those set forth in the
Commitment Letter and sufficient to enable Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its terms (the "Substitute
Financing") and (cc) obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides
for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver
to Seller Parent true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment
letter and fee letter (in a redacted form removing only the fee amounts and
economic information, but which redacted fee amounts and economic information
does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Financing) and related definitive financing
documents with respect to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any
commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed
to be a part of the "Financing" and any commitment letter and fee letter for
such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the "Commitment Letter" for all
purposes of this Agreement.



b.Prior to the Closing, Seller Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to provide reasonable cooperation (and cause its applicable
controlled Affiliates to use their commercially reasonable efforts) with the
Financing as is reasonably requested by Purchaser, in each case at the sole
cost and expense of Purchaser. Such cooperation shall include the following:
(i) in connection with the Financing, providing reasonable assistance in the
preparation of customary rating agency presentations, bank books, information
memoranda and other information packages regarding the business, operations
and financial condition of the Business, in each case, to the extent
customarily provided by a borrower in a secured bank loan financing; (ii)
providing reasonable participation by appropriate members of the Business's
management team in a reasonable number of due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations and meetings with prospective lenders
and debt investors, in each case related to the Financing, and in each case
upon reasonable advance notice and at times and locations to be mutually
agreed; (iii) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources with customary
and readily available financial and other pertinent financial information
regarding the Business 

as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to consummate the Financing,
including the Required Financial Information; (iv) if reasonably requested,
providing reasonable assistance in the negotiation of the definitive documents
relating to the Financing, including with respect to any guarantee and
collateral documents and providing Purchaser with any information regarding
the Business reasonably necessary to complete customary closing and perfection
certificates as may be required in connection with the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser; (v) reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral in connection with the Financing; (vi) providing customary
authorization letters (including as to the accuracy of information and the
absence of material non-public information) to the Financing Sources to the
extent requested and (vii) upon reasonable request therefor, at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, furnishing all reasonable
documentation and other information required by bank regulatory authorities
under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Patriot Act, as is requested in writing by
Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, the actions
contemplated in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vii) shall not require any
cooperation to the extent it could reasonably be expected to (A) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Business, (B) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, (C) cause any
condition to the Closing set forth in Article VIII to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (D) require Seller Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-pocket fees or expenses or incur or
assume any other liability or obligation in connection with the financings
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the Financing, (E) require Seller
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
to provide (or to have provided on its behalf) any certificates or opinions or
execute any definitive financing documents, including any credit or other
agreements, pledge or security documents, in connection with the Financing,
(F) cause any director, officer or employee of Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability and none of the boards of
directors (or equivalent bodies) of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to enter into any resolutions or take similar action
approving the Financing, (G) result in the material contravention of, or that
could reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach of,
or a default under, any Laws or under any material Contract to which Seller
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in effect on the date hereof, (H)
require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to provide access to or
disclose information that Seller Parent determines would jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (I)
require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare separate financial
statements (other than the Required Financial Information) or pro forma
financial statements or adjustments. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall
not, prior to the Closing, have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any Person under, the Financing or any other financing that Purchaser may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any
cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 6.28. Seller Parent hereby
consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in use as of the
date hereof, as applicable, in connection with the Financing, in accordance
with customary practice and in the same manner as such logos are used as of
the date hereof in connection with the Business, and subject to any reasonable
restrictions that Seller Parent may impose; provided that the logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or
disparage Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the reputation
or the goodwill of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries or Affiliate. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller Parent's
breach of any of its covenants required to be performed by it under this
Section 6.28 will not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the
conditions in Article VIII unless such breach is material and directly results
in Purchaser being unable to timely satisfy the conditions in the Commitment
Letter and as a result Purchaser is unable to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing at the Closing.



c.Purchaser shall indemnify Seller Parent and its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives from and against any Losses arising out of, resulting from or
relating to the Financing (including any information used in connection
therewith), including, to the extent applicable, promptly upon written request
by Seller Parent, reimburse any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) of Seller Parent or its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives arising out of, resulting from or relating to the
Financing and any activities relating thereto, to the extent such costs and
expenses are incurred (provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed an
independent obligation of Seller Parent or its Affiliates and/or any of their
respective Representatives to incur any such costs and expenses or to
participate in any such financing efforts). The provisions of this Section
6.28(c) shall survive (i) any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1 and (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and are expressly intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, Seller Parent,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, it is understood by the Parties that the
obtaining, or availability, of any proceeds of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the Closing or to Purchaser's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to the availability of
remedies set forth in Section 10.17. Each of (A) Purchaser's breach of any of
its representations or warranties in Section 5.6 or Purchaser's breach of any
of its obligations in this Section 6.28 and (B) the failure, for any reason,
of Purchaser to have sufficient cash available on the Closing Date to pay the
Preliminary Purchase Price and/or the failure to so pay the Preliminary
Purchase Price on the Closing Date, in each case, shall constitute a willful
and material breach of this Agreement by Purchaser and Seller Parent will be
entitled to all remedies pursuant to this Agreement, including Section 9.2.



d.None of Seller Parent, the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers, the Conveyed
Subsidiaries and each of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, controlling Persons and agents
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source (and no Financing
Source shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to
Seller Parent, the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers, the Conveyed Subsidiaries
and each of their respective stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, controlling Persons and agents) in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
performance of any financing commitments of such Financing Source with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 6.28(d) shall limit or modify the rights and
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement.



Section 6.29 Exchange Act Filings. 



a.After the date hereof, Seller Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall
deliver to Purchaser, (i) as promptly as practicable, final audited combined
balance sheets of the Business as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014,

have occurred prior to March 30, 2017 but shall have occurred on or prior to
April 30, 2017, prior to 60 days after the Closing Date, (y) if the Closing
shall have occurred on or after May 1, 2017, prior to 45 days after the
Closing Date and (z) if the Closing shall have occurred on or prior to March
30, 2017, prior to any demand for registration of the Share Consideration
pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, and (B) as promptly as practicable
following the end of each fiscal quarter if the Closing has not occurred
within 45 days of such fiscal quarter (except the fourth quarter of any fiscal
year) the unaudited combined balance sheets of the Business, and the related
combined statements of income, business unit equity, and cash flows, on an
historical basis taking into account adjustments required by Regulation S-X
and prepared on a "predecessor" basis (which shall have been reviewed by
Seller Parent's independent accountants in accordance with the Statement on
Auditing Standards No. 100) as of and for such fiscal quarter and, if
applicable, the six-month and nine-month period then ended (and the
corresponding fiscal quarter and interim period from the previous year)
(together with the financial statements required pursuant to clauses (ii) and
(iii), the "Interim Financial Statements").



b.The Interim Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby and the
books and records of Seller Parent, in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Statements for the equivalent periods, including
with respect to (i) footnote disclosure (except, in the case of Interim
Financial Statements, such exceptions and omitted footnotes as are customary
in the preparation of interim financial statements) and (ii) the audit or
review, as applicable, of Seller Parent's independent accountants.



c.Seller Parent agrees to consent to the inclusion of any financial statements
or information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.29, by or at
the request of Purchaser in any filings by Purchaser with the SEC or any other
securities regulatory authority or exchange.



d.Seller Parent agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
independent accountants to provide to Purchaser with a consent for the use of
its report relating to any financial statements or information obtained by
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.29 in any SEC filings by or on behalf of
Purchaser. 

e.Seller Parent shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective employees and representatives to
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, with respect to any financial statements
(including pro forma financial statements) that Purchaser deems reasonably
necessary in order to make any filing required by applicable Law or stock
exchange requirements, including filings with the SEC.

commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any

Section 7.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.



a.Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, from and after the Closing
Purchaser agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents,
employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Losses that such Seller Indemnified
Party suffers or incurs, or becomes subject to, as a result of, (i) any
Assumed Liability (regardless of whether such Assumed Liability was assumed by
Purchaser or a Purchaser Designated Affiliate pursuant to Section 2.5), (ii)
any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, or any other agreement, instrument or

Business, the Purchased Assets, or the Shares from and after the Closing Date,
including the use, ownership, possession, operation or occupancy of any

offer for sale, import or export of any Company Medical Device Products (as

Products (as defined in the Intellectual Property License Agreement) by or on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Sublicensees.



b.Seller Parent shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including
incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach
which gives rise to such Loss.

Section 7.3 Indemnification Procedures.



a.If any Action is instituted by or against a third party with respect to
which any of the Persons to be indemnified under this Article VII (the
"Indemnified Party") intends to claim any Loss hereunder (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to
the Party from whom indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Party")
indicating, with reasonable specificity, the nature of such Third Party Claim,
the basis therefor, a copy of any documentation received from the third party,
an estimate of the Losses relating thereto, and the provisions of this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, and/or any other agreement, instrument or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto in respect of which such Loss
shall have occurred. A failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to
tender the defense of the Action in a timely manner pursuant to this Section
7.3(a) shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this
Article VII, except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby, (ii) to the extent expenses are incurred during
the period in which notice was not provided, and (iii) as provided by Section
7.4. Payments for Losses for Third Party Claims which are otherwise covered by
the indemnification obligations herein shall not be required except to the
extent that the Indemnified Party has expended out-of-pocket sums.



b.Subject to Section 6.21(b), upon receipt of a notice for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.3(a) with respect to any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party under this Article VII shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to assume the defense of, at its own expense and by its
own counsel, any such Third Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party
shall 

not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) such Third Party
Claim is reasonably foreseeable to result in Losses which are more than two
hundred percent (200%) of the amount indemnifiable by such Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 7.3; (ii) such Third Party Claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (iii) such Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (iv) the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party; or (v) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the
appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party shall, in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, undertake
to compromise or defend any such Third Party Claim, it shall notify the
Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall
agree to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
compromise of, or defense against, any such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Third Party
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement releases
the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Claim and provides
relief consisting solely of money damages borne by the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, and the
Third Party Claim concerns any Intellectual Property of the other Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party with
respect to such aspects of the Third Party Claim that concern the ownership,
validity, or enforceability of such Intellectual Property, including by not
making any admission or offer of settlement in such Third Party Claim that
could reasonably be expected to have prejudice or adverse effect, and in the
event and to the extent that any Third Party Claim relates to or may affect or
otherwise impair ownership of or rights in, or the scope, validity or
enforceability of, any Licensed IP, the prosecution and defense of such
aspects of such Third Party Claim shall be governed by the Intellectual
Property License Agreement. Notwithstanding an election of the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of such Action, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the defense
of such Action.



c.In the event any Indemnified Party has an indemnification claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall so notify the Indemnifying Party promptly
in writing describing such Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if
known or reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of
such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, or any other agreement,
instrument or certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto in respect of
which such Loss shall have occurred. A failure by the Indemnified Party to
give notice and to tender the conduct or defense of the Action in a timely
manner pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) shall not limit the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party under this Article VII, except (i) to the extent such
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby and (ii) as
provided by Section 7.4. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in
the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction set forth in Section 10.12.
Within ten (10) Business Days of the final determination of the amount of any
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an 

amount equal to the agreed claim by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a
notice to the Indemnifying Party not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
such payment.



d.Purchaser will provide notice and an opportunity to comment to Seller Parent
before Purchaser or any of its Affiliates files any material Required
Governmental Report or any other report, notification or filing with any
Governmental Authority or third party in connection with an event that would
be reasonably likely to result in a Loss subject to the indemnification
provisions of Section 7.1. In the event Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
required to file a material Required Governmental Report or any other report,
notification or filing immediately, Purchaser will provide simultaneous notice
to Seller Parent when the report is filed with the Governmental Authority.



Section 7.4 Expiration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Closing occurs, all covenants and agreements made herein or
in any Ancillary Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms; provided, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, (x) the obligations of Purchaser to assume, and to indemnify Seller
Indemnified Parties for, the Assumed Liabilities, or reimburse Seller Parent
for costs and expenses expressly provided for in this Agreement, and (y) the
obligations of Seller Parent to retain, and indemnify Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for, the Retained Liabilities, shall in each case survive the Closing
indefinitely. No action or proceeding seeking damages or other relief for
breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall be
commenced after the date on which such covenant or agreement shall terminate
in accordance with its terms, unless prior to such termination date a claim
for indemnification with respect thereto has been made, with reasonable
specificity, by written notice given under Section 7.3. All representations
and warranties made herein and all indemnification obligations under Sections
7.1 and 7.2 with respect to any such representations or warranties, shall
terminate and expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking damages or other
relief for breach of any thereof or for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy
with respect thereto shall be commenced after, the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, unless prior to such anniversary date a claim
for indemnification with respect thereto has been made, with reasonable
specificity, by written notice given under Section 7.3, except that (i) the
Fundamental Representations shall survive and the right to bring a claim for
indemnification for breach of such representations or inaccuracy thereto shall
continue indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.17 shall survive, and the right to bring a claim for indemnification
for breach of such representations or inaccuracy thereto shall continue, until
sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (giving effect to any extensions and waivers thereof).



Section 7.5 Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Article VII, neither Seller Parent nor Purchaser, as applicable, shall have
any indemnification obligations for (a) Losses under Section 7.1(a)(ii) or
7.2(a)(ii), to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
the Preliminary Purchase Price, (b) under Section 7.1(a) to the extent such
Losses result from, arise out of or are the consequence of, in whole or part
any intrusive investigation, including any drilling, sampling, testing or
monitoring of any soil, surface water or groundwater by or on behalf of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, in each case, except to the extent such
action or intrusive investigation was expressly 

required by Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or is undertaken in
response to a substantial threat to human health or the environment; or (c)
Losses under Section 7.1(a)(iii) or 7.2(a)(iii), in respect of any individual
item or group of items where the Loss relating thereto is less than $100,000
(the "De Minimis Claim Threshold"), or in respect of each individual item or
group of related items where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater
than the De Minimis Claim Threshold, unless the aggregate amount of all such
Losses exceeds $5,000,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event the applicable
Party shall be required to pay only the amounts of such Losses from the first
dollar of any such Losses but only up to a maximum amount of $100,000,000 (the
"Maximum Indemnification Amount"); provided, that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the same Loss be taken into
account more than once for purposes of calculations in connection with, or
application of, the De Minimis Claim Threshold, the Deductible or the Maximum
Indemnification Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.5 shall not apply
to or count towards any indemnification obligation of (A) Seller Parent for
Losses resulting from (1) any Excluded Asset, (2) any Retained Liability, (3)
the Retained Businesses, (4) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller Parent set forth in Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.15
(except with respect to the Maximum Indemnification Amount, which shall apply
for any indemnification obligations of Seller Parent with respect to Section
4.15) and Section 4.19 (collectively, the "Seller Fundamental
Representations"), or (5) Seller Parent's fraud, and (B) Purchaser for Losses
resulting from (1) any Purchased Asset, (2) any Assumed Liability, (3) the
Business, (4) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser set
forth in Section 5.1, Section 5.2, Section 5.3, and Section 5.11
(collectively, the "Purchaser Fundamental Representations", and together with
the Seller Fundamental Representations, the "Fundamental Representations"),
(5) any use by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of the Hospira Marks
pursuant to Section 6.18, (6) Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' or
Sublicensees' (as defined in the Intellectual Property License Agreement)
exercise of any license or other rights set forth in the Intellectual Property
License Agreement, (7) the research, development, manufacture, use, sale,
offer for sale, import or export of any Company Medical Device Products (as
defined in the Intellectual Property License Agreement) or Company Solutions
Products (as defined in the Intellectual Property License Agreement) by or on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Sublicenseesor or (8)
Purchaser's fraud.



Section 7.6 Losses Net of Insurance, Etc. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under Sections 7.1 or 7.2 shall be net of (i) any
accruals or reserves on the Final Closing Statement specifically identified
and attributable to such Loss, but solely to the extent of the amount of such
accrual or reserve, (ii) any amounts included in the settlement of the Final
Working Capital or the Final Net Cash specifically identified and attributable
to such Loss, and (iii) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any
third party (net of any costs of investigation of the underlying claim and of
collection), (iv) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of
reimbursement actually received (net of any costs of investigation of the
underlying claim and of collection) as an offset against such Loss (each
Person named in clauses (iii) and (iv), a "Collateral Source"), and (v) an
amount equal to the net Tax benefit resulting from such Loss that is actually
realized no later than the second Tax year following the Tax year of the Loss
by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. Indemnification under this Article
VII shall not be available unless the Indemnified Party first uses its
reasonable best efforts to seek 

recovery from all Collateral Sources. The Indemnifying Party may, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, require an Indemnified Party to assign to
the Indemnifying Party the rights to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding
sentence (to the extent such rights are capable of assignment); provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing
such claim at its own expense; and provided, further, that the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate (at the Indemnifying Party's expense) with the
Indemnifying Party to seek such recovery. If the amount to be netted hereunder
from any payment required under Sections 7.1 or 7.2 is determined after
payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid
to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party
shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any
amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
Article VII had such determination been made at the time of such payment.



Section 7.7 No Right of Set-Off. Neither Seller Parent, on the one hand, nor
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall have any right to set-off any Losses under
this Article VII against any payments to be made by such Party or Parties
pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement among the Parties, including
in any Ancillary Agreement.



Section 7.8 Materiality Scrape. For purposes of this Article VII, in
determining whether there has been an inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty and the amount of any Losses that are the subject
matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder, each representation and
warranty shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any
materiality qualifications contained therein (including the terms "material",
"material adverse effect", "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar terms),
except, with respect to this Section 7.8, the following references shall not
be disregarded: (i) use of the word "Material" as used in the defined terms
"Material Adverse Effect," "Material Contract," "Material Shared Contract" and
"Purchaser Material Adverse Effect," (ii) references to materiality contained
in each of Section 4.6(b), Section 4.9(a), Section 4.12(a), Section 4.12(b),
Section 4.13(a), Section 4.17(a), Section 4.17(b), Section 4.18(a), (iii)
references to a Material Adverse Effect contained in Section 4.7(a).



Section 7.9 Sole Remedy/Waiver. From and after the Closing, except with
respect to (i) claims arising from actual fraud, and (ii) claims seeking
specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to covenants to be
performed after the Closing or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this Article
VII and Section 6.6 with respect to Taxes shall be the Parties' sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, except any remedies to the extent expressly set forth in
the Ancillary Agreements for claims that may arise thereunder (and for
clarity, the Parties' rights and obligations with respect to such remedies
shall be subject to the terms set forth therein).



Section 7.10 Indemnification Payments. A Party (and its Affiliates) shall not
be deemed to have suffered a Loss with respect to an item to the extent such
Party was actually compensated therefor by reason of an increase in the amount
otherwise paid to it or a reduction in the amount otherwise paid by it
pursuant to Section 2.10. Seller Parent hereby waives any claim of subrogation
or contribution against the Conveyed Subsidiaries (and Subsidiaries thereof)
with respect to any indemnification obligation owing to Purchaser Indemnified
Parties.

the Closing:



a.by written agreement of Purchaser and Seller Parent, acting as agent for
each other Seller;



b.by either Purchaser or Seller Parent, by giving written notice of such

anniversary of the date hereof (the "Outside Date"); provided, that if all of
the conditions to the obligations of Seller Parent and Purchaser to consummate
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Article VIII (other than those
conditions set forth in Section 8.1(b) and those conditions that by their

anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to (x)

Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date or (y) the other Party during the pendency of any
Action by a Party for specific performance of this Agreement;



c.by Purchaser upon written notice to Seller Parent, if there shall have been
a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of Seller Parent which has
rendered the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 8.2 incapable
of fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been waived by Purchaser, and
the breach has not been cured within forty-five (45) days (or, if earlier, the
Outside Date) following Purchaser's written notice of such breach and/or is
not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(c), if not
exercised, shall terminate sixty (60) days following delivery of such written

contained herein;



d.by Seller Parent upon written notice to Purchaser, if there shall have been
a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of Purchaser which has
rendered the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 8.3 incapable
of fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been waived by Seller Parent,
and the breach has not been cured within forty-five (45) days (or, if earlier,
the Outside Date) following Seller Parent's written notice of such breach

f.by Seller Parent upon written notice to Purchaser, if (i) all of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been satisfied as of the
date on which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 3.1 (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing or waived by Seller Parent (to the extent waived by
Seller Parent)), (ii) Purchaser fails to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within three (3) days of the date on which

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.



a.In the event of termination of this Agreement prior to Closing pursuant to
Section 9.1, (i) written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party, and (ii) except as set forth in this Section 9.2, this Agreement shall
terminate and be void and have no effect and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned, without any liability or obligation on the part of
any Party, the Financing Sources and each of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers or employees, provided that termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any Party from damages for (i) any Intentional Breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or (ii) actual fraud, in which case,
such breaching Party shall be fully liable to the other Party for any and all
Losses; and provided further that in no event shall Seller Parent have any
claim for Intentional Breach (except as set forth in Section 9.2(d)) against
Purchaser in any circumstance in which Seller Parent has the right to
terminate this Agreement under the circumstances set forth in Section 9.2(d).



b.Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, the following Sections of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect: Section 6.1(b)
(Information and Documents), Section 6.28(c) and Section 6.28(d) (Financing),
Section 9.1 (Termination), Section 9.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article X
(Miscellaneous).



c.If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for the term
provided for therein; except, that Seller Parent and Purchaser agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement (including the employee non-solicitation prohibition
therein) shall be extended for a period of time equal to the Confidentiality 

Agreement's original term as if such term commenced on the date of this
Agreement, and this Section 9.2(c) shall be the requisite mutual written
consent amending such Confidentiality Agreement.



d.In the event Seller Parent shall terminate this Agreement prior to the
Closing pursuant to Section 9.1(f) or pursuant to Section 9.1(d) as a result
of, or due to, Purchaser's Intentional Breach(es) of either Section 6.4 or
6.28, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller Parent a fee in the
amount equal to $75,000,000 ("Reverse Termination Fee") as liquidated damages
hereunder, by wire transfer of same-day funds on the second Business Day
following the date of such termination of this Agreement. The Parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement and (ii) the Reverse Termination Fee payable by Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 9.2(d) is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Seller Parent and its Affiliates for
the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance upon this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, and
for the loss suffered by reason of the failure of such consummation, which
amount would otherwise be uncertain and incapable of accurate determination.
If Purchaser fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section
9.2(d), it shall also pay any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller
Parent in connection with enforcing this Agreement (including by legal
action), together with interest on such unpaid amount payable under Section
10.10 ("Collection and Interest Amounts"). Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Reverse
Termination Fee, if paid, in addition to the Collection and Interest Amounts,
(B) any indemnification amounts payable to Seller Parent under Section 6.28(c)
and (C) any fee reimbursements payable to Seller Parent under this Agreement,
including under Section 6.4(h), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller Parent, the Share Sellers, the Asset Sellers and each of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents
and shareholders (collectively "Seller Parties") against Purchaser, any
Purchaser Designated Affiliate, the Financing Source and each of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, Representatives, agents
and equityholders (collectively, the "Purchaser Parties") for any damages,
expenses (including any fees and expenses of Representatives), losses or
liabilities of any nature and kind incurred or suffered by the Seller Parties
(without regard to any limitation on types or measurement of damages in this
Agreement including those set forth in the definition "Loss" in Section 1.1 or
Section 7.5) in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (ii), upon payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee, the Seller Parties shall have no further remedy in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any breach thereof. In no event
shall Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Insofar as Seller Parent may pursue both a grant of specific
performance to the extent permitted by Section 10.17 and the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee to the extent permitted by this Section 9.2(d), under
no circumstances shall any Seller Party be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance to require Purchaser to consummate the
Closing and an award or judgment entitling Seller Parent to receive the
Reverse Termination Fee.

Section 10.2 Amendment; Waiver. Subject to the last sentence of Section 10.6,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
Purchaser and Seller Parent, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.



Section 10.3 Assignment.



a.Except as permitted pursuant to the first sentence of Section 10.3(b), no
Party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
including by sale of stock, operation of Law in connection with a merger or
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such Party, without the
prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Purchaser
may assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to the
Financing Sources as collateral for the Financing.



b.Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate one
or more of its Affiliates that are directly or indirectly wholly owned by
Purchaser (each, a "Purchaser Designated Affiliate") to be the purchaser or
transferee of some or all of the Shares or the Purchased Assets (and to be a
counterparty to one or more of the Ancillary Agreements), provided, that no
such designation (i) shall release Purchaser from its obligations under this
Agreement or (ii) would be reasonably expected to restrict or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay or reimburse the
Sellers for any incremental Tax liabilities and other reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses resulting solely from the substitution of a Purchaser
Designated Affiliate for Purchaser as the purchaser of any of the Shares or
the Purchased Assets in accordance with this Section 10.3(b).



Section 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure
Letter, the Purchaser Disclosure Letter and all Annexes and Exhibits) contains
the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, with respect to such matters, except for (i) the Confidentiality
Agreement which will remain in full force and effect for the term provided for
therein and (ii) any written agreement of the Parties that expressly provides
that it is not superseded by this Agreement.



Section 10.5 Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any Party to any
other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.



Section 10.6 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except with respect to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Seller
Indemnified Parties solely with respect to Article VII or as 

expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, the Sellers, or their
successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of Section
6.28(d), Section 9.2, Section 10.2, Section 10.3(a), this Section 10.6, and
Section 10.12, each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of
the Financing Sources, and the Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on
and enforce the provisions of such Sections, and such Sections (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of Section 6.28(d),
Section 9.2, Section 10.2, Section 10.3(a), this Section 10.6, and Section
10.12, may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse
in any material respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources).



Section 10.7 Public Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each Party agrees that, except as may be required to comply with the
requirements of any applicable Laws, and the rules and regulations of each
stock exchange upon which the securities of either of the Parties or their
Affiliates is listed (in which case the disclosing Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) advise the other Party before making
such disclosure and (b) provide such other Party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such release or announcement and consider in good faith
any comments with respect thereto), no press release or similar public
announcement or communication shall be made or caused to be made concerning
the execution or performance of this Agreement unless the Parties shall have
consulted in advance with respect thereto.



Section 10.8 Return of Information. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are terminated as provided herein:



a.notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall return to Seller Parent or destroy, in its sole discretion,
all documents and other material received by Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
from the Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates, relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof; and



b.all Confidential Information received by Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives with respect to the Sellers, or any of their
respective Affiliates, the Business, Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities as
well as the Excluded Assets, Retained Businesses and the Retained Liabilities,
shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms notwithstanding
the termination of this Agreement.



Section 10.9 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement (including Section 6.4(h), Section 6.12, Section 6.28(c), and
Section 9.2), whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party
incurring such expenses.



Section 10.10 Interest. Unless otherwise specified, if any payment required to
be made to a Party under this Agreement is made after the date on which such
payment is due, interest shall accrue on such amount from (but not including)
the due date of the payment to (and including) the date such payment is
actually made at the Interest Rate. All computations of interest pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty
five (365) days, in each case for the actual number of days from (but not
including) the first day to (and including) the last day occurring in the
period for which such interest is payable.



Section 10.11 Disclosure Letters; Disclosures Modifying Other Sections of
Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Letter and the Purchaser Disclosure Letter,
and all schedules attached thereto, and all Annexes and Exhibits attached to
this Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this
Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim
herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Annex, Exhibit or Schedule or in the
Seller Disclosure Letter or Purchaser Disclosure Letter but not otherwise
defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement. Any
information, item or other disclosure set forth in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this
Agreement (or to have been set forth in any other Section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, as the case may be), if
the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure notwithstanding the omission of a reference or
a cross-reference with respect thereto and notwithstanding any reference to a
Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter or Purchaser Disclosure Letter, as
applicable, in such Section of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter in
any Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Purchaser Disclosure Letter
shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller Parent or
Purchaser, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for
purposes of this Agreement.



Section 10.12 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.



a.This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of
such state.



b.With respect to any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, the Financing or transactions contemplated thereby
or involving a Financing Source (each, a "Proceeding"), each Party irrevocably
(i) agrees and consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if for any reason the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, any New York State court sitting in New York City
and (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of
venue of any Proceeding brought in any such court, waives any claim that such
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the
right to object, with respect to such Proceeding, that such court does not
have any jurisdiction over such Party. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING
OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN
THE MANNER PROVIDED IN Section 10.1, OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE
PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND 

SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO SERVICE
ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER HEREIN PROVIDED.



c.THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE TO CAUSE
THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES TO WAIVE, THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS, THE FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.



Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic .pdf submission), each of which shall be
deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by telecopy or otherwise) to the
other Party, it being understood that both Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.



Section 10.14 Headings. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.



Section 10.15 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.



Section 10.16 Rules of Construction. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement and, therefore, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.



Section 10.17 Specific Performance.



a.The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur and that
the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law (i) for any actual or
threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that, subject only to the
limitation set forth in Section 10.17(b) below in the circumstances
applicable, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement (including enforcing
a Party's obligation to consummate, and effect, the Closing) and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
Section 6.4) and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection
herewith (without proof of actual damages, and each Party further agrees to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy). 

b.Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without liming the generality of Section
10.17(a) as it relates to enforcement other than solely the obligation for
Purchaser to effect the Closing, it is explicitly agreed that the Seller
Parent may seek specific performance of the Purchaser's obligation to
consummate the Closing if and only in the event that (i) all conditions set
forth in Section 8.1, Section 8.2 and Section 8.3, have been satisfied or
waived (other than conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred, (ii) the
Financing has been funded or will be funded at Closing, and (iii) Seller
Parent has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and
the Financing is funded and Share Consideration is issued, then the Sellers
shall take such actions as are in its control to cause the Closing to occur.

c.Any action or proceeding for any such remedy shall be brought exclusively in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any
New York State court sitting in New York City, and each Party waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any
such remedy. The Parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 10.17, a Party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under
this Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
Section 10.17 are not available or otherwise are not granted (or, if such
remedies are granted, the right to reimbursement of its costs and expenses
relating to such enforcement actions) and (y) nothing contained in this
Section 10.17 shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any Party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this Section 10.17 before exercising any termination right under Section
9.1 (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement
of any action pursuant to this Section 10.17 or anything contained in this
Section 10.17 restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Section 9.1 or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter, in each case, subject
to the last sentence of Section 9.2(d).



Section 10.18 Affiliate Status. To the extent that a Party is required
hereunder to take certain action with respect to entities designated in this
Agreement as such Party's Affiliates, such obligation shall apply to such
entities only during such period of time that such entities are Affiliates of
such Party. To the extent this Agreement, an Ancillary Agreement requires an
Affiliate of any Party to take or omit to take any action, such agreement and
obligation includes the obligation of such Party to cause such Affiliate to
take or omit to take such actions.



Section 10.19 Translation of Currencies. Except with respect to the
determinations set forth in the following two sentences, in the event that the
Parties need to convert currencies under this Agreement, the relevant exchange
rate shall be determined based on the rate in effect as of the close of
business (New York time) two (2) Business Days preceding the applicable
determination date as published 

on Bloomberg.com. In the event that any Person needs to convert currencies for
purposes of calculating the Final Working Capital or the Final Net Cash, the
relevant exchange rate shall be determined based on the rate in effect on the
Closing Date as captured on Bloomberg.com. In the event that any Person needs
to convert currencies for purposes of calculating the amount of any claim
under Article VII, the relevant exchange rate shall be determined based on the
rate in effect as of the close of business (New York time) two (2) Business
Days preceding the date of the written notice given under Section 7.3 with
respect to such claim as published on Bloomberg.com. Seller Parent and
Purchaser agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the
Parties, the currency exchange rate for converting United States of America
dollars ("USD") to a currency other than USD, in connection with a payment of
any portion the Final Purchase Price under a Local Implementing Agreement,
shall be determined by reference to the World Market Closing FX Rates (mid
rate) as published by The WM Company / Reuters as of 4:00 p.m. (GMT) on the
day that is two Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.
