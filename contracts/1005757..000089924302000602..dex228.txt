Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters   Unless otherwise expressly
provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation shall apply:   Calculation of Time Period. When calculating
the period of time before  -------------------------- which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such   -9-   period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.   Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender
shall include  ----------------- all genders, and words imparting the
singular number only shall include the plural and vice versa.   Headings.
The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this 
-------- Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the
insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise specified.   Herein. The words
such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and  ------ ------ -----------
------ "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision  --------- in which such words appear unless the context
otherwise requires.   Including. The word "including" or any variation
thereof means "including,  --------- --------- ---------- without
limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general
statement ------------------ that it follows to the specific or similar
items or matters immediately following it.   Schedules and Exhibits. The
Schedules and Exhibits attached to this  ---------------------- Agreement
shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same
extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any
matter disclosed by Seller on any one Schedule shall be deemed disclosed for
purposes of all other Schedules if reasonably apparent that such matter is
relevant.   Reasonable Commercial Efforts. The obligation of a party to use
reasonable  ----------------------------- commercial efforts to accomplish
an objective means that the obligated party is required to make a diligent,
reasonable and good faith effort to accomplish the applicable objective. Such
obligation, however, does not require any unreasonable expenditure of funds
or incurrence of liability on the part of the obligated party (in each case,
in the context of the expenditure to be made or liability to be incurred);
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit  --------
------- Seller\'s obligations under Section 5.2, nor does it require that the
obligated party act in a manner that would be contrary to normal commercial
practices in order to accomplish the objective. The fact that the objective
is or is not actually accomplished is no indication that the obligated party
did or did not in fact utilize its reasonable commercial efforts in
attempting to accomplish the objective.  2. Purchase and Sale of the
Business   2.1 Purchase and Sale of Assets   Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Seller shall, and

funds to an account designated by Seller\'s written instructions to Buyer at
least two Business Days prior to Closing. If the Estimated Purchase Price
exceeds $300,000,000 the amount of such excess is referred to as

Purchase Price the amount of such excess is referred to as the "Negative
Amount."   (c) Purchase Price Adjustment.  -------------------------

Business on the Closing Date, (y) include the items consistent with those

Statement, Buyer shall notify Seller of any objections to the Closing Date
Net Assets Statement or the amount shown as "Net assets to be sold" (the "Net
Asset Amount") thereon, specifying in reasonable detail any 
---------------- such objections. If Buyer fails to notify Seller of any
objections within such period, Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Net Asset Amount. If Buyer has no objections or if Seller and Buyer resolve
all such objections, the Net Asset Amount on the Closing Date Net Assets
Statement (with any such changes as may be agreed) shall be final and
binding. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve Buyer\'s objections within

purposes of this Agreement, the term "Assumed Liabilities" means only the

paragraphs (a) through (d) below, whether or not any such obligation has a
value for accounting purposes or is carried or reflected on or specifically
referred to in the Financial Statements of the Business:   (a) the
liabilities and obligations arising on or after the Closing Date under the
Assumed Leases and the transferred Licenses and Contracts and
those liabilities and obligations which arose prior to or on the Closing Date
relating to "Deferred Revenue" shown on the Net Assets (Liabilities)
Statement and those arising after the date thereof prior to the Closing Date
which would be classified as such;   (b) with respect to the Business, any
warranty liabilities arising from sales of software or products in the
ordinary course of business;   (c) all Assumed Employee Liabilities; and  
(d) all other obligations and liabilities with respect to the Business or the
Purchased Assets, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, arising on
or after the Closing Date, even if such obligations or liabilities arise from

Excluded Employee Liabilities.   -14-    2.5 Excluded Liabilities  
Buyer shall not assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise assume or
discharge any liabilities or obligations of Seller or any of Affiliate
of Seller or any of their respective predecessors, whether direct or
indirect, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, other than Assumed
Liabilities and shall not assume any Excluded Liabilities. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Excluded Liabilities" means all liabilities or
obligations other than  -------------------- Assumed Liabilities, including
those set forth or described in paragraphs (a) and (d) below, whether or not
any such liability or obligation has a value for accounting purposes or is

Environmental Liability;   (c) any liability or obligations relating to an
Excluded Asset; and   (d) all Excluded Employee Liabilities   2.6 Further

Parties   (a) From time to time following the Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge
and deliver all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and
acquittances and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions,
at each such Person\'s cost and expense, as may be necessary or appropriate
fully to assure Buyer and its respective successors or assigns, all the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements and fully to assure Seller and its Affiliates and their
successors and assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and obligations
intended to be assumed by Buyer under this Agreement and the Collateral
Agreements, and otherwise to make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including (i) transferring back to Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary any asset or liability not contemplated by this
Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively,
which asset or liability was transferred to Buyer at the Closing and (ii)
transferring to Buyer any asset or liability contemplated by this Agreement
to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively, which was not
transferred to Buyer at the Closing).   (b) Nothing in this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be construed
as an attempt or agreement to assign any Purchased Asset, including any
Contract, Unassignable Contract, Assumed Lease, Transitional Leasehold
Interest, License, Nonassignable License, certificate, approval,
authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without the consent of a Third Party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable
by a Third Party or would constitute a breach or other contravention of such
Purchased Asset or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or Seller
thereunder in the event of an assignment ("Nonassignable Assets") unless 
-------------------- and until such consent shall have   -15-   been
obtained. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with Buyer at its request in
endeavoring to obtain such consents promptly; provided, that such cooperation
shall not require  -------- Seller or any of its Affiliates to remain
secondarily liable or to make any payment to obtain any such consent with
respect to any Nonassignable Asset.   (c) Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, or to cause to be
obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate
(which shall not require a payment to the Person from whom novation is
sought) all obligations under any and all Contracts or other obligations or
liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the
unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates so that, in any such case,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for such liabilities and
obligations. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, if consents to the
assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be
held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Seller or the applicable Affiliate
of Seller in trust for Buyer and the covenants and obligations thereunder
shall be performed by Buyer in Seller\'s or such Affiliate\'s name and all
benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Buyer\'s account.
Seller shall take or cause to be taken at Buyer\'s expense such actions in
its name or otherwise as Buyer may reasonably request,
including subcontracting, sub-licensing or subleasing to Buyer, so as to
provide Buyer with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect
collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under
the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller
shall promptly pay over to Buyer any consideration received by it in respect
of all Nonassignable Assets.   (d) As of and from the Closing, Seller on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, at Buyer\'s
expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the benefits of
Seller or its Affiliates under the Nonassignable Assets and appoints Buyer
its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf or in the name of the
applicable Affiliate of Seller and on such Affiliate\'s behalf with respect
thereto.   (e) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
unless and until any consent or approval with respect to any Nonassignable
Asset has been obtained, such Nonassignable Asset shall not constitute a
Purchased Asset and any associated liability shall not constitute an Assumed
Liability for any purpose under this Agreement, and, so long as Seller is
able to provide Buyer with all material economic benefits of such
Nonassignable Asset, the failure of any such consent or approval to be
obtained or the failure of any such Nonassignable Asset to constitute a
Purchased Asset or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Seller Material Adverse Effect
or a breach by Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or a failure of any condition under this
Agreement.   2.7 No Licenses   Unless expressly set forth in the
Intellectual Property Agreements, no title, right or license of any kind is
granted to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any
Proprietary   -16-   Information of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller,
either directly or indirectly, by implication, by estoppel or otherwise.  
2.8 Bulk Sales Law   Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and each of
the Subsidiaries with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer"
Laws of any jurisdiction, that may otherwise be applicable with respect to
the sale of any or all the Purchased Assets to Buyer.   2.9 Taxes   (a)
Buyer and Seller shall share equally all applicable Taxes and all recording
and filing fees that may be imposed, assessed or payable by reason of the
operation or as a result of this Agreement, including the sales,
transfers, leases, rentals, licenses and assignments contemplated hereby,
except for Seller\'s or any Subsidiary\'s net income and capital gains taxes
or franchise or other taxes based on Seller\'s or any Subsidiary\'s net
income ("Transfer Taxes");  -------------- provided, however, that if Buyer
acquires the Purchased Assets in a manner such -------- ------- that
following the Closing the Purchased Assets are not held by Buyer and
its affiliates through entities in the same jurisdictions as the entities
through which the Purchased Assets are currently held by Seller and the
Subsidiaries (a "Parallel Structure"), then Buyer shall be liable for any
Transfer Taxes to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount of Transfer
Taxes that would have been imposed, assessed or payable had Buyer acquired
the Purchased Assets in a Parallel Structure.   (b) All real property
taxes, personal property taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with
respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable period which includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations")
shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based 
----------------------- on the number of days of such taxable period included
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period
after the Closing Date (with respect to any such taxable period, the "Post-
Closing Tax Period"). Seller  ----------------------- shall be liable for
the proportionate amount of such taxes that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
such taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.   (c)
Apportioned Obligations and Transfer Taxes shall be timely paid, and all
applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as provided
by applicable law. Upon the payment of any Transfer Tax, the paying party
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying party in accordance
with Section 2.9(a). With respect to Apportioned Obligations, 10 days prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement showing its
calculation of an estimated amount of all Apportioned Obligations (based upon
actual tax bills or assessments or, if not available, tax bills for the prior
comparable period) and an apportionment of such estimated amount in
accordance with Section 2.9(b). Buyer will have the right to review Seller\'s
statement. If within 5 days after receipt of Seller\'s statement, Buyer
notifies Seller in writing that it objects to the statement, Buyer and Seller
agree to resolve any dispute as promptly as possible so that the final
estimate of all Apportioned Obligations will be agreed no later than two days
prior to the Closing Date. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the excess,
if any, of (i) the Apportioned Obligations actually paid by Seller as of the
Closing Date over (ii) the   -17-   estimated amount of the Apportioned
Obligations apportioned to Seller, or, Seller shall pay to Buyer the excess,
if any, of (i) the estimated amount of the Apportioned Obligations
apportioned to Seller over (ii) the Apportioned Obligations actually paid by
Seller as of the Closing Date. If the actual amount of any Apportioned
Obligation paid to a Taxing Authority differs from the estimated amount of
such tax, then the paying party shall notify the non-paying party and, within
10 days after receipt of such notice, Seller shall pay Buyer or Buyer shall
pay Seller, as the case may be, the difference between the payments made in
respect of the estimated Apportioned Obligations and the payment that would
have been made at Closing if the estimated amount had been based upon the
actual amount of Apportioned Obligations.  3. Representations and Warranties

prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax.
Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to the Purchased Assets for a period of at least seven years
following the Closing Date. At the end of such period, each party shall

of such books and records. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving

Consideration   (a) Seller and Buyer recognize their mutual obligations
pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code to file timely IRS Form 8594 (the "Asset
Acquisition  ----------------- Statement") with each of their respective
federal income Tax Returns. --------- Accordingly, Seller and Buyer shall,
within the later of (i) 60 days after the Closing and (ii) 14 days after the
Net Asset Amount is finally determined under Section 2.3(c), each deliver to
the other party a proposed statement, allocating the Purchase Price (plus
Assumed Liabilities and any other consideration, to the extent required to be
taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets
and the covenants of Seller (including those set forth in the Collateral

(b) Following the delivery of the proposed statements, the parties will use
reasonable commercial efforts to agree on an allocation and an
Asset Acquisition Statement. If, within 15 days after delivery of the
proposed statements, Seller and Buyer are unable, in good faith, to reach
such an agreement, Seller and Buyer will each use their respective proposed
allocation statements. If, within 15 days after delivery of the proposed
statements, Seller and Buyer shall have agreed on an allocation and an Asset
Acquisition Statement, then Seller and Buyer shall file the Asset Acquisition
Statement in the form so agreed and will act in accordance with the Asset
Acquisition Statement in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax
Return.   (c) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.3(c), and such adjustment has not been taken into
account previously, then the Asset Acquisition Statement shall be adjusted in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer and Seller agree to file any
additional information return required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060
of the Code.   -32-    5.5 Business Employees   (a) Between the date
hereof and the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of (i)
any offer of employment to any New Hire in accordance with Section 5.2(h),
indicating for each, the name, start date, position, functional job category,
job location, base salary, commission eligibility and short-term incentive
plan target and (ii) the termination of the employment or commencement of any
disability or leave of absence of any Business Employee, indicating, where
relevant, the term of any such approved leave of absence. As of the
applicable Transition Date, Buyer shall make offers of employment to
each Business Employee who is, as of such Transition Date, actively at work
with Seller or is absent due to vacation, holiday, illness, leave of absence,
short- term disability or other approved leave of absence (including under
the Family and Medical Leave Act or workers\' compensation) and who presents
himself or herself to return to work within the greater of 180 days (or such
longer time as may be required by a collective bargaining agreement) after
such Transition Date or the duration of the approved leave of absence, but
excluding any Business Employees on long-term disability. The applicable
"Transition Date" for each  --------------- Business Employee shall be (i)
with respect to Business Employees employed within the U.S. or the U.K. as of
the Closing Date, the date following the Closing Date and (ii) with respect
to Business Employees employed in any country other than the U.S. or U.K. as
of the Closing Date, the date that Buyer has established a legal and staff
structure for the hiring of such Business Employees in such country, but in
no event later than the date 180 days following the Closing Date, unless
otherwise provided under the final terms of the Transition Services
Agreement. Seller shall not terminate, and shall cause its Affiliates not to
terminate, the employment of any Business Employee with Seller or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date and prior to the applicable Transition Date
for such Business Employee without the prior written consent of Buyer and
shall make such Business Employees available to provide services to Buyer
following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed
under the Transition Services Agreement. As of the date immediately following
the applicable Transition Date for a Business Employee, Seller and
its Affiliates shall cease to employ such Business Employee as an employee
or independent contractor. Seller and Buyer intend that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute an event
entitling any Business Employee to severance benefits. Business Employees who
accept Buyer\'s offer of employment, as of the effective date of their
employment with Buyer, are referred to as "Transferred Employees". Employment
with Buyer of Transferred  --------------------- Employees shall be
effective as of the applicable Transition Date, provided that the employment
of Business Employees receiving short-term disability benefits or on approved
leave of absence on the applicable Transition Date will become effective as
of the date they present themselves for work with Buyer if such date is
within the greater of 180 days (or such longer time as may be required by a
collective bargaining agreement) after the applicable Transition Date or the
duration of the approved leave of absence; provided, further, that Buyer\'s 
-------- obligation to employ any such Business Employee receiving short-term
disability benefits, or on approved leave of absence on the applicable
Transition Date shall be subject to the availability of a comparable position
at such time, subject to applicable Law, and if no such comparable position
is available, such Business Employee shall receive severance benefits from
Buyer in accordance with the broad-based severance policy of Buyer applicable
to Buyer\'s employee (and Buyer shall assume all liabilities relating to its
failure to   -33-   employ any such Business Employee in the same
position or a comparable position upon such employee\'s ability to return to
work in accordance with applicable Law).   (b) During the period commencing
as of a Transferred Employee\'s employment with Buyer and ending as of the
first anniversary of the Closing, Buyer shall provide to such Transferred
Employee (i) in the case of a U.S. Transferred Employee, an annualized salary
equal to 105% of the annualized base salary provided to such Transferred
Employee by Seller immediately prior to Closing, and in the case of a
non-U.S. Transferred Employee, an annualized salary equal to the annualized
base salary provided to such Transferred Employee by Seller immediately prior
to Closing, (ii) a bonus opportunity at least as favorable as the bonus
opportunity provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) the
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer. With respect to
the Transferred Employees, each employee medical, dental, vision care and
prescription drug plan, program, policy and arrangement of Buyer shall
waive any pre-existing condition exclusion (to the extent such exclusion was
waived under any similar plan of Seller or its Affiliates) and any proof
of insurability and shall recognize for purposes of satisfying any
deductibles, co- pays and out-of-pocket maximums during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs, any payment made towards deductibles, co-pays and
out-of-pocket maximums for such calendar year under any similar plan of
Seller or its Affiliates. Seller agrees to transfer the cafeteria plan
accounts and experience of Transferred Employees to substantially equivalent
plans that exist or will be established by Buyer. Seller and Buyer agree to
determine the terms and conditions of such transfer. All service by a
Transferred Employee with Seller, including service with predecessor
employers that was recognized by Seller and its Affiliates shall be
recognized by Buyer for purposes of vacation entitlement and participation
and vesting under the benefits of Buyer, including any defined benefit or
defined contribution pension plans, welfare benefit plans and severance plans
of Buyer. Buyer will continue to provide relocation assistance to those
Transferred Employees receiving it as of the Closing Date and
tuition assistance to those Transferred Employees who are receiving such
benefits as of the Closing Date for the academic session then in effect (the
"Relocation and  -------------- Tuition Benefits"). With respect to
Transferred Employees who are on ---------------- international assignment
as of the Closing Date, Buyer will provide the benefits provided under
Seller\'s international assignee program as in effect as of Closing,
including repatriation upon completion of assignment, completion bonuses, Tax
equalization and Tax Return preparation, the costs of which shall be
allocated between Buyer and Seller based on the portion of the
international assignment occurring before the Closing Date (which shall be
the "Seller  ------ International Assignee Costs") and on or after the
Closing Date , which shall be ---------------------------- the "Buyer
International Assignee Costs"). Buyer shall assume all liabilities 
---------------------------------- and obligations of Seller or any
Subsidiary with respect to and honor the vacation, personal days and floating
holidays accrued but unused by each Transferred Employee as of the Closing
and shall be solely liable for such accruals (the "Accrued Days"). Buyer
shall assume and honor all liabilities and  ------------ obligations of
Seller under the retention bonus arrangement with the Transferred Employees
described in Schedule 3.9(b)(ii) and shall be solely liable for such bonuses
(the "Retention Bonus Liability").  -------------------------   (c) Seller
shall make and be responsible for the payment of all accrued but unpaid
incentive compensation of each Transferred Employee for all periods prior to
the Closing Date (the "Pro Rata Annual Bonuses"). 
-----------------------   -34-    (d) Seller shall be responsible for and
shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer for any failure to provide
health continuation coverage (including any penalties, excise taxes or
interest resulting from the failure to provide continuation coverage)
required by Section 4980B of the Code (i) due to qualifying events with
respect to each Business Employee who does not accept employment with Buyer
and (ii) due to qualifying events with respect to each Transferred Employee
which occur on or before the Closing Date, or, with respect to any
Transferred Employee who does not commence employment with Buyer as of the
date immediately following the Closing Date as a result of short
term disability or leave of absence, due to qualifying events which occur
before commencement of such Transferred Employee\'s employment with Buyer
(the "Seller  ------ COBRA Obligation"). Buyer shall be responsible for and
shall defend, indemnify ---------------- and hold harmless Seller for any
failure to provide health continuation coverage (including any penalties,
excise taxes or interest resulting from the failure to provide continuation
coverage) required by Section 4980B of the Code due to qualifying events with
respect to each Transferred Employee which occur after the commencement of
such Transferred Employee\'s employment with Buyer (the "Buyer COBRA
Obligation"). Seller shall be responsible for providing any 
---------------------- applicable COBRA notices to any Business Employee in
respect of events occurring prior to such Business Employee\'s commencement
of employment with Buyer.   (e) Seller hereby acknowledges that for FICA and
FUTA Tax purposes, Buyer qualifies as a successor employer with respect to
the Transferred Employees. In connection with the foregoing, at Buyer\'s
option, Seller agrees to follow the "Alternative Procedures" set forth in
Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 96-60. Buyer shall notify Seller of its
intention to follow the "Alternative Procedures" on or immediately after the
Closing Date. If the "Alternative Procedures" are followed, Seller and Buyer
understand that Buyer shall assume Seller\'s entire obligation to furnish a
Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement to the Transferred Employees notwithstanding
Section 5.3. In addition to all records relating to the Transferred Employees
that Seller shall deliver to Buyer as of the Closing Date or as otherwise
required by this Agreement, Seller shall timely provide Buyer with any and
all other information (and in such format and media) as it shall reasonably
request to properly comply with the requirements in the preceding sentence,
which in no event shall be more than 10 Business Days from the date of a
written request for such information.   (f) (i) Where applicable Law of any
non-U.S. jurisdiction provides for the transfer of employment of the Business
Employees upon a sale of the Business, (x) Buyer or its subsidiaries shall
assume and honor all terms and conditions of employment in respect of such
Business Employees to the extent required to accomplish such transfer of
employment and (y) Buyer and Seller agree to take such actions as are
reasonably practicable (including the assumption, if necessary, of potential
or actual liabilities relating to the employment of such Business Employees)
such that the employment of such Business Employees will transfer to the
Buyer and its subsidiaries as a matter of Law on the applicable Transition
Date. Where the applicable Law of any non-U.S. jurisdiction do not provide
for the transfer of employment of the Business Employees upon the sale of the
Business, Buyer shall offer to employ such Business Employees as of
the applicable Transition Date at the same salary and wages payable by Seller
and the Subsidiaries to such Business Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date and on terms and conditions of employment which replicate those
provided by Seller and the Subsidiaries   -35-   immediately prior to
the Closing Date as and to the extent required by applicable Law (including
the E.U. Acquired Rights Directive) or as a result of negotiation with
applicable works councils. All offers of employment made by Buyer and its
subsidiaries shall be sufficient to avoid statutory severance obligations,
other than where such severance is automatic, in which event such severance
shall be borne by Seller. Buyer shall bear all expenses of any compensation
resulting from negotiations with works councils and agreed to by Buyer for
which Seller is not specifically liable under this Agreement. Nothing herein
shall be construed as a representation or guarantee by Seller that Business
Employees will accept Buyer\'s or its subsidiaries\' offer of employment or
will continue in employment following the Closing Date. Buyer and
Seller agree to comply with all applicable local Laws and collective
agreements pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement.   (ii) To
the extent Legally Required: (A) liabilities under the Seller Non-U.S. Plan
set forth on Schedule 5.5(f) to or relating to Transferred 
--------------- Employees (the "Assumed Pension Obligation") shall be assumed
by the appropriate  -------------------------- non-U.S. plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer; and (B) a portion of any assets of the Seller Non-U.S.
Plan shall be transferred to the appropriate non-U.S. plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer in accordance with this Section 5.5(f)(ii). If the Seller
Non-U.S. Plan specifies a transfer basis, that basis shall be used to compute
the asset transfer amount. Otherwise, the asset transfer amount shall be the
amount for each Transferred Employee that has been individually
funded/insured for that employee if funding/insuring is performed on an
individual-by-individual basis. If neither of the two immediately preceding
sentences apply, the asset transfer amount for each Transferred Employee
shall be the accumulated benefit obligation multiplied by the present benefit
obligation funded percentage, both determined on the basis of the actuarial
methods and assumptions used by Seller for purposes of Seller\'s financial
disclosure under FAS 87 and FAS 106 for such plans as of September 30, 2001.
Where required, the parties hereto will use reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary consents to such transfer of assets and liabilities.   (iii) For
purposes of this Section 5.5(g), "Legally Required" means 
---------------- required under the laws of the country, the labor union,
works council or collective bargaining agreement, including mandated waiting
periods before which working conditions (including benefits) cannot be
changed, and upon receiving required agreement from individual employees
and/or plan trustees, foundation boards and members and any other
organizations having a recognized right to determine or affect benefits
and/or funding of a plan.   (g) Except as explicitly provided in the
Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall be solely responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from (in accordance with Section
9.2) (A) the Relocation and Tuition Benefits, Buyer International Assignee
Cost, Accrued Days, Retention Bonus Liability, Buyer COBRA Obligation and
Assumed Pension Obligation and (B) all compensation and benefit obligations
and liabilities relating to any Transferred Employee (and his or her
dependents or beneficiaries) earned, accrued or incurred after the date such
Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer and all obligations and
liabilities relating to workers compensation claims and Employment Law Claims
to the extent arising from events or conditions first coming into existence
after the date such Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer (the
"Assumed Employee  ----------------   -36-   Liabilities"). Except as
explicitly provided in the Transition Services ----------- Agreement, Seller
shall retain and be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
Buyer harmless from (in accordance with Section 9.2) (X) all employment-
related obligations and liabilities relating to each Business Employee (and
his or her dependents or beneficiaries) with respect to whom Buyer has
fulfilled its obligations, if any, under this Section 5.5 to offer or 
----------- transfer employment, but who does not become a Transferred
Employee as described above and (Y) all compensation and benefit obligations
and liabilities relating to any Transferred Employee (and his or her
dependents or beneficiaries) earned, accrued or incurred prior to the date
such Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer and all obligations
and liabilities relating to workers compensation claims and Employment Law
Claims to the extent arising from events or conditions existing prior to the
date such Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer, including the
Seller COBRA Obligations, Seller International Assignee Cost and the Pro Rata
Annual Bonuses, but excluding the Assumed Employee Liabilities (the "Excluded
Employee Liabilities"). For purposes  ----------------------------- of this
Section 5.5 the term "Employment Law Claims" includes all claims, 
----------- --------------------- charges, complaints, proceedings,
investigations and audits relating to terms and conditions of employment,
hiring, firing, promotion, supervision, occupational safety and health,
workplace, wages and hours, employment practices or treatment of employees.
The term "employment-related obligations and liabilities" includes all
obligations and liabilities relating to or arising in connection with an
employee\'s employment with the Business, including, without limitation,
obligations and liabilities relating to compensation, benefits, workers
compensation and any Employment Law Claims.   5.6 Collateral Agreements;
Leased Equipment   (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith the term, the rent and the incomplete terms of the
form of Subleases and Property Licenses, the schedules for the services to be
attached to the Transition Services Agreement and the Supply Agreement; such
services to include the services described in Schedule 5.6(a). On or prior to
the Closing Date,  --------------- Buyer shall execute and deliver to
Seller, and Seller or the applicable Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to
Buyer the Collateral Agreements.   (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide Buyer with the costs and other terms applicable to the Leased

transfer to Buyer as of the Closing Date by Buyer assuming the leases for
such equipment, in which case such lease agreement shall be deemed a Contract
hereunder, (ii) be acquired by Buyer as of the Closing Date by Buyer paying
for the costs of purchasing such equipment to the applicable Third Party

Closing, the "Purchased Leased Equipment") or (iii) remain the ------

Supplements and Amendments   (a) Each of the parties agrees to use its
reasonable commercial efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and

any extension thereof) shall be extended by such number of days during which
the restriction shall have been breached or violated.   (c) If any provision
contained in this Section 5.11 shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but
this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties
that if any of the restrictions covenants contained herein is held to be for
a length of time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in any way
construed to be too broad or to any extent   -40-   invalid, such
provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to
the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable law,
a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe sand interpret or reform
this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein)
as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable law.   (d) Seller
acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 5.11(a) constitute a
material inducement to Buyer\'s entering into and performing this Agreement.
Seller further acknowledges, stipulates and agrees that a breach of said
obligation could result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to Buyer
for which there may be no adequate remedy at law and further agrees that in
the event of any breach of such obligation, Buyer may be entitled
to injunctive relief and to such other relief as is proper under the
circumstances.   5.12 Additional Financial Statements.   (a) Seller, at

as well; provided that all costs incurred by Seller in connection with
cooperating  -------- with Buyer (including any audit or review by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC and consultants) shall be for the account of
Buyer.  6. Confidential Nature of Information   6.1 Confidentiality
Agreement   Buyer agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
(a) all documents, materials and other information that it shall have
obtained regarding Seller or its Affiliates during the course of the
negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), any
investigations made in connection therewith and the preparation of this
Agreement and related documents and (b) all analyses, reports, compilations,
evaluations and other materials prepared by Buyer or its counsel, accountants
or financial advisors that contain or otherwise reflect or are based upon, in
whole or in part, any of the provided information; provided, that subject to
Section 6.2(a), the Confidentiality  -------- Agreement shall terminate as
of the Closing and shall be of no further force and effect thereafter with
respect to information relating to the Business or any Purchased Asset.  
6.2 Seller\'s and Buyer\'s Proprietary Information   (a) Except as provided
in Sections 6.2(b) and (d), after the Closing and for a period of five years
following the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer agree that it will keep
confidential all Proprietary Information of the other party or its Affiliates
that is received, or made available, in the course of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, for purposes of this Section 6.2, information
about the Business\' business plans and strategies, marketing ideas and
concepts, (including with respect to unannounced products and services),
present and future product plans, pricing, volume estimates, financial data,
product enhancement information, business plans, marketing plans, sales
strategies, customer information (including customers\' applications and
environments), market testing information, development plans, specifications,
customer requirements, configurations, designs, plans, drawings, apparatus,
sketches, software, hardware, data, prototypes, connecting requirements or
other technical and business information, except, in the case of Buyer\'s
obligation, for such Proprietary Information as is conveyed to Buyer as part
of the Purchased Assets.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Proprietary Information shall not be deemed confidential and neither Seller
nor Buyer shall have any obligation with respect to any such Proprietary
Information that:   -42-    (i) at the time of disclosure was already
known to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, other than as a result of this
transaction, free of restriction as evidenced by documentation in Seller\'s
or Buyer\'s possession, as the case may be;   (ii) is or becomes publicly
known through publication, inspection of a product or otherwise, and through
no negligence or other wrongful act of Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be;   (iii) is received by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, from
a Third Party without similar restriction and without breach of any
agreement;   (iv) to the extent it is independently developed by Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be; or   (v) is, subject to Section 6.2(c), required
to be disclosed under applicable Law or judicial process.   (c) If Seller
(or any of its Affiliates) or Buyer (or any of its Affiliates), as the case
may be, is requested or required (by oral question, interrogatory, request
for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any Proprietary Information, such party will promptly
notify the other party of such request or requirement and will cooperate with
such other party such that such other party may seek an appropriate
protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a party (or any of its
Affiliates) is, in the opinion of its counsel (which may be
internal counsel), compelled to disclose the Proprietary Information or else
stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or significant monetary or
non-monetary penalty, such party (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much
of the Proprietary Information to the Person compelling disclosure as is
required by Law. Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, will exercise its (and
will cause its Affiliates to exercise their) reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such Proprietary Information.   (d) Except to
the extent that disclosure thereof is required under accounting, stock
exchange or federal securities or labor relations Laws disclosure
obligations, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Collateral
Agreements, and all attachments and amendments hereto and thereto shall be
considered Proprietary Information protected under this Article 6. Anything
in this Article 6 to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such Proprietary
Information is also subject to a limitation on disclosure or use contained in
another written agreement between Buyer and Seller or either of their
respective Affiliates that is more restrictive than the limitation contained
in this Article 6, then the limitation in such agreement shall supersede this
Article 6.  7. Closing   At the Closing, the following transactions shall

correct and (B) that are not qualified by materiality or Seller Material
Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each
case, at and as of the Closing Date, as though such representations and
warranties were made at and as of the Closing Date, except as affected by (i)
actions or omissions specifically permitted or allowed under this Agreement
and (ii) to the extent that such representations and warranties are made as
of a specified date, in which case, such representations and warranties shall
be true and correct in all material respects as of such dates.   (b)
Performance by Seller. Seller and each Subsidiary shall have 
--------------------- performed in all material respects all obligations and
agreements and complied in all material respects with all covenants required

of Purpose   Neither Seller or Buyer may rely on the failure of any
condition in Sections 8.1.8.2 or 8.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such party\'s failure to use reasonable efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement as required by
Section 5.7.  9. Status of Agreements   The rights and obligations of
Buyer and Seller under this Agreement shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions:   9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties   The
representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article
9 and such representations and warranties shall terminate at the close of
business on the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date, except
for the representations and warranties made pursuant to Section 3.5(b) and
Section 3.9(b), which shall terminate 30 months and 36 months after the
Closing Date, respectively. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability
whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties after such
date Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any representation or warranty
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall
survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the
preceding sentence, if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise
to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the party from whom such
indemnity may be sought prior to such time .   9.2 General Agreement to
Indemnify   (a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the other party hereto, any Affiliate thereof, and any director, officer or
employee of such other party or Affiliate thereof (each an "Indemnified
Party" and, in the  ----------------- case of the Buyer, a "Buyer
Indemnified Party" and, in the case of the Seller, a 
----------------------- "Seller Indemnified Party"), from and against any and
all claims, actions,  ------------------------ suits, proceedings,
liabilities, obligations, losses, and damages, amounts paid in settlement,
interest, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees, court
costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing
or defending the foregoing) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or 
------ suffered by any Indemnified Party to the extent that the Losses arise
by reason of, or result from (i) subject to Section 9.1 and subsection (e)
and (f) of this Section 9.2, any breach of any representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement or (ii) the breach by such party of
any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the
extent not waived by the other party.   (b) Seller further agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any
Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from,
or relating to: (i) the Excluded Liabilities and (ii) Buyer\'s waiver of any
applicable Bulk Sales Laws.   -47-    (c) Buyer further agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Indemnified Party with respect to:
(i) any failure of Buyer to discharge any of the Assumed Liabilities and (ii)
any claims, causes of actions, charges or suits asserted or brought by any
Transferred Employee against Seller or its Subsidiaries arising out of or in
connection with the Buyer\'s failure to offer employment to, or Buyer\'s
termination of employment with Buyer or its Affiliates of, any Transferred
Employee (including, for the purposes of this sub-paragraph, any Business
Employee who would otherwise be considered by definition a Transferred
Employee under this Agreement but for the fact they were not
offered employment by Buyer and were to be offered employment with Buyer
pursuant to Section 5.5(a)), including claims for severance or other
separation benefits and employment discrimination claims.   (d) Amounts
payable in respect of the parties\' indemnification obligations shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a Final Determination
or change in applicable law (including a revenue ruling or other similar
pronouncement) causes any such amount not to constitute an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Federal Tax purposes. In the event of such a
Final Determination or change in applicable law, Buyer or Seller, as the case
may be, shall pay an amount that reflects the hypothetical Tax consequences
of the receipt or accrual of such payment, using the maximum statutory rate
(or rates, in the case of an item that affects more than one Tax) applicable
to the recipient of such payment for the relevant year, reflecting for
example, the effect of deductions available for interest paid or accrued and
for Taxes such as state and local income Taxes; provided, that Buyer shall
only be required to  -------- pay to Seller the excess of the amount so
calculated over the additional Tax or Taxes that would have been imposed if
such payment had been treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Buyer
and Seller agree to cooperate in the preparation of a supplemental Asset
Acquisition Statement as required by Section 5.4 and Treasury Reg. (S)
1.1060-1(e) as a result of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
the first sentence of this subsection. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
(as defined below) chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim (as
defined in Section 9.3(a)) both parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith or
as provided in Section 5.1.   (e) The amount of the Indemnifying Party\'s
liability under this Agreement shall be net of any applicable insurance
proceeds actually received and other savings, including Tax savings, that
have been realized by, the Indemnified Party. If the Tax savings have not
been realized at the time the Indemnifying Party makes a payment under
Section 9, then the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party an
amount equal to the actual Tax savings realized by the Indemnified Party at
the time so realized, provided, that the amount of such  -------- payment
shall not exceed the amount of any indemnity payment made by the Indemnifying
Party with respect to the claim giving rise to the Tax savings. The amount of
any such Tax savings for any Tax period shall be the amount of the reduction
in Taxes payable to a Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax period as
compared to the Taxes that would have been payable to a Taxing Authority
by the Indemnified Party in the absence of such Tax savings.   -48-   
(f) The Indemnifying Party\'s liability for all claims made under
Section 9.2(a) (i) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims until the
aggregate amount of the Losses incurred (determined without regard to any
materiality qualification or qualification with reference to Seller Material
Adverse Affect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect contained in any
representation or warranty giving rise to the claim for indemnity hereunder)
shall exceed 0.5% of Purchase Price, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable only for the portion of the Losses exceeding 0.5% of Purchase
Price, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability for any individual
items where the Loss relating thereto is less than $25,000 (and such items
shall be aggregated for purposes of clause (i)) and (iii) the Indemnifying
Party\'s aggregate liability for all such claims shall not exceed 30% of
Purchase Price.   (g) Absent fraud and subject to Section 9.5, the
indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the parties to this
Agreement for breach of any of the terms, conditions, representations or
warranties contained herein or any right, claim or action arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement;
provided, this exclusive remedy for damages does not  -------- preclude a
party from bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable
remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any Collateral Agreement.   (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for
any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage
arising out of this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing shall not be
construed to preclude recovery by the -------- Indemnified Party in respect
of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims. Both parties shall take
commercially reasonable actions to mitigate their damages.   (i) The rights
to indemnification under this Section 9.2 shall not be subject to set-off for
any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party, whether or
not arising from the same event giving rise to such Indemnified Party\'s
claim for indemnification.   9.3 Indemnification Procedures for Third Party
Claims   (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this
Agreement shall promptly notify the party against whom indemnification is
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the
commencement of any  ------------------ action, suit or proceeding by any
Third Party, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall
give the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless
the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable
by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty days of receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Third Party in respect of
which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), to assume
the defense  ----------------- and control the settlement of such Third-
Party Claim that (i) involves (and continues to involve) solely money damages
or (ii) involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money damages  
-49-   and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be
severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted
by the Third Party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the
claims for money damages.   (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not
control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the
other is defending, as provided in this Agreement.   (c) The Indemnifying
Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third- Party Claim as provided in
this Agreement, shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified
Party\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) unless such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary
damages. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Party\'s
prior written consent, enter into any compromise or settlement that
(i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action
or (ii) does not provide for a complete release by such Third Party of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive
right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it
deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, and
shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages
for which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this
Section 9.3.   9.4 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims  
In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to
this Agreement for other than a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified
Party shall send written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party and
such notice shall specify the basis for such claim in reasonable detail, but
failure to give such notice or so specify such claim shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless the Indemnifying Party
has suffered material prejudice by such failure). As promptly as possible
after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall attempt to resolve such claim by mutual
agreement before resorting to other legal means to resolve such claim.  
9.5 Rights and Remedies   The rights and remedies of Seller and Buyer
provided for under this Agreement shall not effect the rights or remedies of
Seller or Buyer provided for under any of the Collateral Agreements.  10.
