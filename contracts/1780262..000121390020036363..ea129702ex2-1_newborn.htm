2.2 _Reincorporation Effective Time_. The parties hereto shall cause the
Reincorporation Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law, and the Plan of Merger (and

of Companies in the Cayman Islands, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Cayman Islands Companies Law (the time of such filings, or such
later time as specified in the Certificate of Merger and the Plan of Merger,
being the " _Reincorporation Effective Time_ ").

  



  

2.3 _Effect of the Reincorporation Merger_. At the Reincorporation Effective
Time, the effect of the Reincorporation Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, the Plan of Merger and the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law and Cayman Islands Companies Law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Reincorporation
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers and
franchises, debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations of the Parent shall
become the property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises,
debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations of the Reincorporation Surviving

(a) _Conversion of Parent Ordinary Shares_. At the Reincorporation Effective
Time, every issued and outstanding Parent Ordinary Share, other than those
described in _Section 2.6(f)_ below and other than Parent Ordinary Shares (the
" _Converting Shares_ ") that the holders thereof validly have elected to
convert into a pro rata portion of the Trust Fund in connection with the
Closing as provided for in Parent's Organizational Documents and the
Prospectus (as defined in _Section 13.14_ below) (each, a " _Converting
Shareholder_ "), shall be converted automatically into one share of Purchaser
Common Stock. At the Reincorporation Effective Time, all Parent Ordinary
Shares shall cease to be issued and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist. The holders of issued Parent Ordinary
Shares immediately prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time, as evidenced
by the register of members of the Parent (the " _Register of Members_ "),
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares,
except as provided herein or by Law. From and after the Reincorporation
Effective Time, each certificate or book entry position that evidenced Parent
Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger shall entitle
the holder only to the applicable number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
into which such certificate or book entry position is convertible according
to this _Section 2.6(a)_ ; provided, however, that each certificate or book
entry position representing a Converting Share shall entitle the Converting
Shareholder to receive only a pro rata portion of the Trust Fund as provided
for in Parent's Organizational Documents and the Prospectus. Upon surrender of
each certificate (if any) previously evidencing Parent Ordinary Shares, such
certificate shall be exchanged for a certificate representing the same number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(b) _Parent Units_. At the Reincorporation Effective Time, every issued and
outstanding Parent Unit shall be separated automatically into its constituent
securities, which shall be converted automatically into securities of
Purchaser in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ ,  _(c)_ or _(d)_ , as
applicable. At the Reincorporation Effective Time, all Parent Units shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist. The holders of issued Parent Units immediately prior to
the Reincorporation Effective Time, as evidenced by the Register of Members,
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Parent Units, except as
provided herein or by Law. Upon surrender of each certificate (if any)
previously evidencing Parent Units, such certificate shall be exchanged for
certificates representing the applicable number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and Purchaser Warrants.

  



  

(c) _Parent Rights_. At the Reincorporation Effective Time, every issued and
outstanding Parent Right shall be converted automatically into one-tenth
(1/10) of one share of Purchaser Common Stock, in accordance with the terms
thereof. At the Reincorporation Effective Time, all Parent Rights shall cease
to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist. The holders of issued Parent Rights immediately prior to the
Reincorporation Effective Time, as evidenced by the register of
rights holders, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Parent
Rights, except as provided herein or by Law. From and after the
Reincorporation Effective Time, each certificate or book entry position that
evidenced Parent Rights immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger shall
entitle the holder only to the applicable number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock into which such certificate or book entry position is convertible
according to this _Section 2.6(a)_. Upon surrender of each certificate
(if any) previously evidencing Parent Rights, such certificate shall be
exchanged for a certificate representing the applicable number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _Parent Warrants_. At the Reincorporation Effective Time, every issued
and outstanding Parent Warrant shall remain outstanding but shall be
automatically adjusted to become one Purchaser Warrant, in accordance with the
terms thereof. Each Purchaser Warrant will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement (the "
_Warrant Agreement_ "), dated as of February 13, 2020, by and between Parent
and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as warrant agent. At
the Closing, the Purchaser shall enter into an amendment to the Warrant
Agreement solely to evidence the succession of the Purchaser to the Parent
and the assumption by the Purchaser of the covenants of Parent contained in
the Warrant Agreement and the Parent Warrants. Upon surrender of each
certificate (if any) previously evidencing Parent Warrants, such certificate
shall be exchanged for a certificate representing the applicable number of
Purchaser Warrants.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(e) _Parent Unit Purchase Option_. At the Reincorporation Effective Time,
each Parent UPO shall remain outstanding but shall be automatically adjusted
to become a Purchaser UPO, in accordance with the terms thereof. Each of the
Purchaser UPOs shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable agreements governing the Parent UPOs
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time.
At the Closing, the Purchaser shall enter into an amendment to the
agreement governing each Purchaser UPO solely to evidence the succession of
the Purchaser to the Parent and the assumption by the Purchaser of the
covenants of Parent contained in such agreement. At or prior to the
Reincorporation Effective Time, the Purchaser shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation
for so long as any of the Purchaser UPOs remain outstanding, a sufficient
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of
such Purchaser UPOs and the exercise of the Purchaser Warrants included in
such Purchaser UPOs.

  



  

(f) _Cancellation of Parent Ordinary Shares Owned by Parent_. At the
Reincorporation Effective Time, if there are any Parent Ordinary Shares
that are owned by the Parent as treasury shares or any Parent Ordinary Shares
owned by any Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior to the
Reincorporation Effective Time, such shares shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

(g) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for securities of Purchaser
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for securities of Purchaser in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.6_ , none of the Reincorporation Surviving Corporation, Parent or any party
hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  



  

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the

_Section 2.6(c)_ above, and each holder of Parent Securities who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock at
any time of Parent Ordinary Shares are distributed to any such Person
pursuant to this Agreement (after aggregating all fractional shares that
otherwise would be received by such holder in connection with such
distribution) shall receive from Purchaser, in lieu of such fractional share,
one (1) share of Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

2.7 _Surrender of Securities_. All securities issued in exchange for Parent
Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such securities,
provided that any restrictions on the sale and transfer of Parent Securities
shall also apply to the Purchaser Securities so issued in exchange.

  



  

2.8 _Lost Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or securities, as the case may
be, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such
securities, as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.7_ ; provided, however,
that the Reincorporation Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Reincorporation Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

parties acknowledge and agree that each (i) has had the opportunity to obtain
independent legal and tax advice with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for paying its own

consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
(other than any withholding required in connection with amounts
properly treated as compensation for applicable Tax purposes) at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the relevant payment, and the Parties
shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) cooperate to minimize or eliminate
any potential withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and

avoidance of doubt, the receipt of any portion of the Earn-out Shares shall
be treated and reported for income tax purposes as being received as
additional merger consideration as part of the "reorganization" in accordance
with the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except as expressly set forth herein, the
parties acknowledge and agree that no party is making any representation or
warranty as to the qualification of the Acquisition Merger as a reorganization
under Section 368 of the Code or as to the effect, if any, that any
transaction consummated on, after or prior to the Effective Time has or may
have on any such reorganization status. Each of the parties acknowledge and
agree that each such party (i) has had the opportunity to obtain independent
legal and tax advice with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) except as results from a breach of a representation or
warranty of the other party expressly set forth herein, is responsible for
paying its own Taxes, including any adverse Tax consequences that may result
if the Acquisition Merger is determined not to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368 of the Code.

the approval of the automatic conversion of each share of Company Preferred
Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
into shares of the Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
Section B.4.(b)(ii) of Article IV of the Company's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of

agreements or securities purchase agreements from the investors party thereto,
together with all exhibits (including documents attached as exhibits),

3.13 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under Delaware Law, shares of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
Delaware Law and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of
Delaware Law relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights
(such shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such
Stockholders shall have no right to receive, the Per Share Merger
Consideration unless and until such Stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under
Delaware Law. Any Stockholder who fails to perfect or who effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of Delaware Law shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Closing Consideration and,
subject to and in accordance with _Section 4.4(a)_ below, the applicable
portion of the Earn-out Shares, without any interest thereon, upon surrender,
if applicable, in the manner provided in _Section 4.3_, of the certificates
representing the Company Common Stock that formerly evidenced such Dissenting
Shares.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of

demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and

shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
 CONVERSION OF SHARES; CONSIDERATION

  



  

4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Closing Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(i) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver a written statement to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Closing Statement_ "), setting forth
on a consolidated basis the Company's determination of the Company Group's
Indebtedness for borrowed money immediately prior to the Closing (after the
conversion of the Bridge Loan). The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, consistent with past practice (as modified by the
terms of this Agreement) and shall be accompanied by a certificate executed by
an executive officer of the Company to such effect.

  



  

(ii) The aggregate amount to be paid by the Purchaser at the Closing with
respect to the Company Common Stock (other than the Bridge Loan Shares) and
the Company Options shall equal (x) $100,000,000, plus (y) the aggregate
exercise price of the Company Options outstanding as of the date hereof or
issued between the date hereof and the Closing, minus (z) the amount of the
Company's Indebtedness for borrowed money immediately prior to the Closing
(after the conversion of the Bridge Loan) as set forth in the Closing
Statement (the " _Closing Merger Consideration_ "), payable in shares of
Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with _Section 4.1(b)_ below.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(b) _Conversion of Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Acquisition Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger
Sub, the Company or the Stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to _Section 4.2(a)_ above and
the Bridge Loan Shares), other than the Dissenting Shares, shall be canceled
and automatically converted into the right to receive, without interest
(the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "):

  



  

(i) at the Closing, a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the
Closing Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share Closing Consideration,_ " and the
aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration, the "Closing Shares"); and

  



  

(ii) subject to and in accordance with _Section 4.4(a)_ below, a portion of
Earn-out Shares (as defined below); provided that the Bridge Lender shall not
have the right to receive any Earn-out Shares with respect to the Bridge Loan
Shares.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, each Stockholder will cease to have any rights
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to
receive the Per Share Closing Consideration and the applicable portion of the
Earn-out Shares.

  



  

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
by virtue of the Acquisition Merger and without further action on the part of
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock are so
converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation's
capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common
stock will, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the
Company (as treasury shares or otherwise) or any of its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and
extinguished without any conversion or consideration delivered in exchange
thereof.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
4.1_ , none of Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to
any person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(f) _Surrender of Certificates_. All shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued
upon the surrender of shares of the Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such securities.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
for any share of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Purchaser shall cause to be issued in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates and for each such share, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Merger
Consideration; provided, however, that _Purchaser_ may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
_Purchaser_ with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

  



  

(h) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding securities of the Company or the
shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall occur (other than the issuance of
additional shares of capital stock of the Company or Purchaser as permitted by
this Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or
combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any
stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, any amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change;
provided, however, that this sentence shall not be construed to permit
Purchaser or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the
Acquisition Merger, and each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock at any time shares of Purchaser
Common Stock are being distributed to any such Person pursuant to this
Agreement (after aggregating all fractional shares that otherwise would be
received by such holder in connection with such distribution) shall receive
from Purchaser, in lieu of such fractional share, one (1) share of Purchaser
Common Stock.

  



  

4.2 _Company Derivative Securities_.

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Preferred Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause each share of Company Preferred Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be automatically
converted into a number of shares of the Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of Section B.4.(b)(ii) of Article IV of the Company's amended
and restated certificate of incorporation filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware on December 13, 2017. At the Effective Time, all of
the shares of the Company Common Stock issued upon such automatic conversion
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Closing
Consideration and the applicable portion of the Earn-out Shares, in accordance
with _Section 4.1(b)_  above and _Section 4.4_ below. All of the shares of
Company Preferred Stock so converted into shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall cease to exist
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each holder of Company Preferred
Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Preferred Stock.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(b) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Option, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Purchaser and
converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock (such option, an " _Exchanged Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded
to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (ii) the Closing Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to quotient of (i) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by (ii) the Closing Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Exchanged Options shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; provided, further, that in
the case of any Exchanged Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the
exercise price and the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and the U.S. Department
of Treasury regulations thereunder, as applicable. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
acceleration as to vesting that may have been triggered in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and subject to the adjustments required
by this  _Section 4.2(b)_ after giving effect to the Acquisition Merger).
Purchaser shall assume the Company Plan (the " _Assumed Plan_ ") such that
the Exchanged Options will be issued under the Assumed Plan, provided that the
Assumed Plan shall be amended such that no further awards may be granted
under the Assumed Plan, and Purchaser shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options. At or prior to
the Effective Time, the Parties and their boards, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
assumption of the Company Plan and the treatment of the Company Options
pursuant to this subsection, and to cause any disposition or acquisition of
equity securities of Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 4.2(b)_ by each
individual who is a director or officer of Purchaser or who will become a
director or officer of Purchaser at the Effective Time to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Purchaser shall file an appropriate
registration statement or registration statements with respect to the shares
of Purchaser Common Stock subject to such Exchanged Options (other than any
Exchanged Options held by any former employee, director or consultant of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such awards remain outstanding.

  



  

4.3 _Merger Consideration Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Stockholders shall deliver the certificates evidencing their
right to shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or the
instruments evidencing the Bridge Loans to the Company for cancellation, or
in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or instrument, will
deliver to the Company an affidavit (and indemnity if required) in the manner
provided in _Section 4.1(g)_ above, together with a letter of transmittal in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (" _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and upon the Closing, the Stockholders shall receive in
exchange therefor their respective portions of the Closing Shares (less their
respective portions of the Escrow Shares, except in the case of the Closing
Shares issuable in respect of the Bridge Loan Shares) in book-entry
form (unless certificates representing such shares of Purchaser Common Stock
are otherwise requested by a Stockholder) in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)_
above, and the certificates representing the Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock and the instruments representing the Bridge Loans shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding certificates for
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and instruments representing
the Bridge Loans will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Closing
Shares (less the applicable portion of the Escrow Shares, except in the case
of the Closing Shares issuable in respect of the Bridge Loan Shares), and
subject to and in accordance with _Section 4.4(a)_ below, the applicable
portion of the Earn-out Shares, as prescribed by this Agreement.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(b) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect
to Purchaser Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holders of any unsurrendered certificates for Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock and instruments representing the Bridge
Loans with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration to be issued upon
surrender thereof until the holders of record of such certificates shall
surrender such certificates and instruments. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such certificates or instruments, Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, the
applicable portion of the Closing Shares issued in exchange therefor in book-
entry form (unless certificates representing such shares of Purchaser Common
Stock are otherwise requested by a Stockholder) and the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

(c) _Transfers of Ownership_. If shares of Purchaser Common Stock are to be
issued in book-entry form in a name other than that in which the certificates
for Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and the instruments for
the Bridge Loans surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be
a condition of the issuance thereof that the certificates or instruments so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to the
Purchaser or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares of Purchaser Common Stock representing
the Per Share Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificates so surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

  



  

4.4 _Earn-out Payment._

  



  

(a) In addition to the Closing Merger Consideration, the Stockholders shall
be entitled to receive an additional 4,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common
Stock (the " _Earn-out Shares_ ") if, for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2021, the Purchaser's revenue, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as
consistently applied heretofore by the Company Group, equals or
exceeds $30,000,000; provided that the Bridge Lender shall not be entitled to
receive Earn-out Shares with respect to the Bridge Loan Shares.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit in escrow the Earn-out Shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement to be entered
into at the Closing between the Purchaser, the Stockholder Representative, and
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as escrow agent (the " _Earn-out
Escrow Agreement_ "). The Earnout Escrow Agreement will provide that, within
five (5) Business Days of the filing of the Purchaser's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, provided the Earn-out
Shares are earned in accordance with _Section 4.4(a)_ above, the Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative shall provide joint written instructions to
the escrow agent to release the Earn-out Shares to the Stockholders. Each
Stockholder (other than any holder of Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to
receive a number of Earn-Out Shares equal to (i) the number of Closing Shares
(other than Closing Shares issued in respect of the Bridge Loan Shares) that
continue to be beneficially owned by such Stockholder and its Permitted
Transferees, including any Closing Shares held in escrow pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the Earn-out Rate (rounded to the
nearest whole share).

  



  

(c) All share and per share amounts in this _Section 4.4_ shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or
combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or
any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, with respect to the
Purchaser Common Stock subsequent to the Closing Date.

  



  

4.5 _Restrictions on Transfer._ The Letter of Transmittal shall
include, among other provisions, restrictions on transfer of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued in connection with the Acquisition Merger
hereunder, pursuant to which the shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued to
each Stockholder (other than the Closing Shares issued in respect of the
Bridge Loan Shares) will be locked up for one (1) year (subject to
certain exceptions contained in the Letter of Transmittal); provided, that
50% of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued to each Stockholder will
be released from the foregoing lockup if the volume-weighted average price per
share of the Purchaser Common Stock is $12.50 or greater for 20 trading days
in any 30 consecutive trading day period commencing more than six (6)
months after the Closing. The book entry position or certificate representing
such shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall include prominent disclosure or
bear a legend evidencing the fact that such shares are subject to such lockup
described in this _Section 4.5_.

the foregoing, a " _Governmental Approval_ ") and except where the failure to

(including the names and addresses of the insurers, the names of the
Persons if other than the Company Group to whom such insurance policies have
been issued, the expiration dates thereof, the annual premiums and payment

brief identification of the nature of the policy) of all liability, property,
workers' compensation and other insurance policies currently in effect that
insure the property, assets or business of the Company Group or its employees
(other than self-obtained insurance policies by such employees). Each such
insurance policy is valid and binding and in full force and effect, all
premiums due thereunder have been paid and the Company Group has not received
any notice of cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy or
default thereunder. The Company Group believes such insurance policies, in
light of the nature of the Company Group's business, assets and properties,
are in amounts and have coverage that are reasonable and customary for Persons
engaged in such business and having such assets and properties. Neither the
Company Group, nor, to the knowledge of the Company Group, the Person to whom
such policy has been issued, has received notice that any insurer under any
policy referred to in this _Section 5.17_ is denying liability with respect
to a claim thereunder or defending under a reservation of rights clause.
Within the last two (2) years, the Company Group has not filed for any claims
exceeding $2,000,000 against any of its insurance policies, exclusive of
automobile and health insurance policies. The Company Group has not received
written notice from any of its insurance carriers or brokers that any
premiums will be materially increased in the future, and does not have any
reason to believe that any insurance coverage listed on Schedule 5.17 will
not be available in the future on substantially the same terms as now in
effect.

of the Permits will, assuming the related third party consents have been
obtained or waived prior to the Closing Date, be terminated or impaired or
become terminable as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby. The

Permits the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.19 _Compliance with Laws_. The Company Group is not in violation of, and
during the past two (2) years has not violated, any Law, or judgment, order

conditions immediately following the Closing.

right to use all its Business Systems, and such Business Systems are
sufficient for the immediate needs of the Business as currently conducted by
the Company Group. Except as specified in _Section 5.20(g)_ of the disclosure
schedule, the Company Group maintains commercially reasonable disaster
recovery and business continuity plans, procedures and facilities, and since

been or is revised or superseded by a later filed Parent SEC Document or
Additional Parent SEC Document, then on the date of such filing) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As used in this _Section 6.16_ , the term "file" shall be broadly
construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

  



  

   

43

principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act.

the extension as provided for in Parent's Organizational Documents. Parent may
only adjourn the Extension Shareholders' Meeting (i) to solicit additional
proxies for the purpose of obtaining approval of the Extension Proposal or to
take steps to reduce the number of Parent Ordinary Shares issued in the IPO as
to which the holders thereof elect to convert such shares into a pro rata
portion of the Trust Fund in connection with the extension as provided for in
Parent's Organizational Documents, (ii) if a quorum is not present at the
Extension Shareholders' Meeting, (iii) to amend the Extension
Proposal, subject to the Company's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is
required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by shareholders of Parent prior to the
Extension Shareholders' Meeting; provided that the Extension
Shareholders' Meeting is reconvened as promptly as practical thereafter.
Parent agrees that if the approval of the Extension Proposal shall not have
been obtained at any such Extension Shareholders' Meeting, then Parent shall
continue until February 12, 2021 to take all such necessary actions and hold
additional Extension Shareholders' Meetings in order to obtain the approval of
the Extension Proposal. If approval has not been obtained by February 12,
2021, Parent may cease seeking to have the Extension Proposal
approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the Company's prior written
consent, Parent may not take a vote at the Extension Shareholders' Meeting if
more than 25% of the Parent Ordinary Shares issued in the IPO elect to convert
such shares into a pro rata portion of the Trust Fund in connection with the
extension as provided for in Parent's Organizational Documents.

limiting the foregoing, Parent, the Purchaser, and the Company shall each
ensure that the Extension Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which
it is first distributed to Parent shareholders and the holders of the Company
Capital Stock and Company Options, and as of the date of the Extension
Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
(provided that no Party shall be responsible for the accuracy or completeness
of any information relating to another Party or any other
information furnished by another party for inclusion in the Extension Proxy
Statement).

  



  

(v) Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in the
Extension Proxy Statement the recommendation of its board of directors that
Parent's shareholders vote in favor of the Extension Proposal, and shall
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to obtain approval thereof. Neither
Parent's board of directors nor any committee or agent or representative
thereof shall withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), or
propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Company)
Parent's board of director's recommendation that the Parent shareholders vote
in favor of the adoption of the Extension Proposal.

  



  

(vi) If the Extension Proposal is approved and the Parent is required to pay
an additional amount into the Trust Account, (a) not later than the fifth
Business Day prior to February 19, 2021, provided the Closing has not
occurred, Parent shall deliver an extension letter to the Trustee
substantially similar to Exhibit D to the Trust Agreement, signed on behalf of
Parent by an executive officer of Parent, and (b) not later than February 19,
2021, provided the Closing has not yet occurred, the Company and the Parent
shall deliver the aggregate amount necessary by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Trustee, for deposit in the Trust Account in
accordance with the extension letter and the Trust Agreement. Each of the
Company and the Sponsor shall pay 50% of such payment. In exchange for any
amounts so paid, the Company and the Sponsor will receive a promissory note as
described in the Prospectus.

  



  

(vii) The Company Group shall reimburse the Parent for the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel to Parent incurred in connection with the
preparation of the Extension Proxy Statement, up to a maximum aggregate amount
of $20,000.

and the Extension Proposal has not been approved by the fifth Business Day
prior to February 19, 2021, Parent shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates
to take, all steps necessary in order to extend the period of time Parent is
afforded under its Organizational Documents and the final prospectus relating
to the IPO to consummate an initial business combination by an additional
three months, or until May 19, 2021. Without limiting the foregoing, (a) not
later than the fifth Business Day prior to February 19, 2021, provided the
Closing has not occurred and the Extension Proposal has not been approved,
Parent shall deliver an extension letter to the Trustee substantially similar
to Exhibit D to the Trust Agreement, signed on behalf of Parent by an
executive officer of Parent, and (b) not later than February 19, 2021,
provided the Closing has not yet occurred and the Extension Proposal has not
been approved, the Company and the Sponsor shall deliver an aggregate of
$575,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds (the " _Extension
Payment_ ") to the Trustee, for deposit in the Trust Account in accordance
with the extension letter and the Trust Agreement. Each of the Company and the
Sponsor shall pay 50% of the Extension Payment. In exchange for any amounts
so paid, the Company and the Sponsor will receive a promissory note as
described in the Prospectus. Simultaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, the Sponsor has delivered to the Company Group and the Purchaser
Parties a commitment agreement, pursuant to which the Sponsor has committed to
fund its portion of the Extension Payment (the " _Commitment Letter_ ").

Parties shall prepare with the assistance, cooperation and commercially
reasonable efforts of the Company Group, and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, and
including the Proxy Statement contained therein, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock and the Purchaser Warrants to be issued in
the Reincorporation Merger and the Closing Shares and the Earn-out Shares to
be issued in the Acquisition Merger, which Registration Statement will also
contain a proxy statement of Parent (as amended, the " _Proxy Statement_ ")

be acted upon at the Parent Extraordinary General Meeting and providing the
public shareholders of Parent an opportunity in accordance with Parent's
Organizational Documents and the Prospectus to have their Parent
Shares converted into a pro rata portion of the Trust Fund in connection with
the Closing. The Proxy Statement shall include proxy materials for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from Parent shareholders to vote, at an
extraordinary general meeting of Parent shareholders to be called and held
for such purpose (the " _Parent Extraordinary General Meeting_ "), in favor of
resolutions approving (i) the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
Additional Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,

Organizational Documents, Cayman Islands Companies Law and the rules and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the approvals described in
foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), collectively, the " _Parent Shareholder
Approval Matters_ "), and (vii) the adjournment of the Parent Extraordinary
General Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of
Parent. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Parent
Shareholder Approval Matters shall be the only matters (other than procedural
matters) which Parent shall propose to be acted on by the Parent shareholders
at the Parent Extraordinary General Meeting. In connection with the
Registration Statement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company Group will file with
the SEC financial and other information about the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and applicable proxy
solicitation and registration statement rules set forth in Parent's
Organizational Documents, Delaware Law and the rules and regulations of the
SEC and Nasdaq. The Purchaser Parties shall cooperate and provide the Company
Group (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on and approve in writing (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) the Registration Statement, and any
amendment or supplement thereto and any exhibits thereto, and any
responses to comments from the SEC or its staff or the provision of
additional information in connection therewith, prior to filing or
delivery of the same with or to the SEC. The Purchaser Parties shall consider
the comments of the Company in good faith. The Company Group shall provide

any amendments or supplements thereto, which information provided by the
Company Group shall be true and correct in all material respects and not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made not materially misleading
(subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth in the materials
provided by the Company Group). If required by applicable SEC rules or
regulations, such financial information provided by the Company Group must be
reviewed or audited by the Company Group's auditors. The Purchaser Parties
shall provide such information concerning Parent, the Purchaser and their
respective equity holders, officers, directors, employees,
assets, Liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), business and
operations that may be required or appropriate for inclusion in
the Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto,
which information provided by the Parent shall be true and correct in all
material respects and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
not materially misleading. The Purchaser Parties, with the assistance and
written approval of the Company Group, will promptly respond to any SEC
comments on the Registration Statement and will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act and the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC
as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Reincorporation
Merger and the Acquisition Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Purchaser Parties will advise the Company promptly after: (A) the

additional information (and shall provide the Company with a copy or, in the
case of oral communications, summary of such request); and (H) any other
material communication from the SEC (and shall provide the Company with a copy

(b) Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make their
respective directors, officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice,
available at a reasonable time and location to the Company Group, Parent and
their respective representatives in connection with the drafting of the
public filings with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Registration Statement, and responding in a timely
manner to comments from the SEC. Each party shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Registration Statement (and other
related materials) if and to the extent that such information is determined
to have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Laws. The Purchaser Parties shall amend or supplement
the Registration Statement and cause the Registration Statement, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and shall cause the Proxy Statement
to be disseminated to Parent's shareholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Laws and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and Parent's Organizational Documents.

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable following the SEC declaring the Registration
Statement effective (" _Effectiveness_ "), Parent shall distribute the Proxy
Statement to Parent's shareholders and (i) having, prior to Effectiveness,
established the record date therefor, shall duly call and give notice of the
Parent Extraordinary General Meeting in accordance with its
Organizational Documents and Cayman Islands Companies Law for a date no later
than forty-five (45) days following the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and (ii) subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, shall solicit proxies from the Parent shareholders to vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Reincorporation Merger and the Acquisition Merger and in favor of the other
matters presented to the Parent shareholders for approval or adoption at the
Parent Extraordinary General Meeting, including, without limitation, the
Parent Shareholder Approval Matters, and shall duly convene and hold the
Parent Extraordinary General Meeting. If on the date for which the Parent
Extraordinary General Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to obtain the Required
Parent Shareholder Approval (as defined below), whether or not a quorum is
present, Parent shall make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Extraordinary General Meeting; provided Parent and
the Purchaser continue to comply with their obligations under this _Section
8.5_.

  



  

(d) Parent, the Purchaser, and the Company shall each comply with all
applicable provisions of and rules under the Securities Act, Exchange Act,
all applicable provisions of Delaware Law and Cayman Islands Companies Law, as
applicable, in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of proxies and issuance of
securities thereunder, and the calling and holding of the Parent
Extraordinary General Meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, the
Purchaser, and the Company shall each ensure that each of the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement do not, as of the date on which it is first
distributed to Parent shareholders and the holders of the Company Capital
Stock and Company Options, and as of the date of the Parent Extraordinary
General Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
(provided that no Party shall be responsible for the accuracy or completeness
of any information relating to another Party or any other
information furnished by another Party for inclusion in the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement).

  



  

(e) Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of its board of directors that
Parent's shareholders vote in favor of the Parent Shareholder Approval
Matters, and shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to obtain approval
of the matters referred to in _Section 8.5(a)_. Neither Parent's board of
directors nor any committee or agent or representative thereof shall withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), or propose to withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to the Company) Parent's board of director's
recommendation that the Parent shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of
the Parent Shareholder Approval Matters.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(f) As soon as practicable following Effectiveness, the Company shall give
notice in accordance with Delaware Law and the Company's Organizational
Documents to all of its Stockholders calling for a special meeting of such
Stockholders to consider and vote upon this Agreement, the Acquisition Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall hold such meeting as
promptly as practicable after such notice is given (" _Company Stockholder
Meeting_ "). The Company shall timely send copies of the Proxy Statement and
all other relevant information and documentation to the Stockholders in
connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company and its board of
directors shall cause the Company Stockholder Meeting to take place in
accordance with the foregoing and in compliance with Delaware Law and the
Company's Organizational Documents and use reasonable best efforts to secure
the Requisite Company Vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at the election and option of the Company, the Company shall
be permitted to obtain the Requisite Company Vote, without a need for calling
a Company Stockholder Meeting, by obtaining the written consent of holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock representing the Requisite Company Vote that
is executed and delivered by such holders after Effectiveness and after the
Proxy Statement is delivered to such holders; provided, that, in the event
that the Company elects to obtain the Requisite Company Vote pursuant to such
written consent, consents with respect to this Agreement, the Acquisition
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will be solicited from
all holders of shares of Company Capital Stock. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Stockholders to (i) to vote (in person,
by proxy or by action by written consent, as applicable) all of their Company
Capital Stock in favor of, and adopt, this Agreement and the Acquisition
Merger and to vote in opposition to any and all other proposals that could
reasonably be expected to delay or impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Acquisition Merger and (ii) to execute and deliver all related
documentation and take such other action in support of the Acquisition Merger
as shall reasonably be requested by the Company in connection with the
Acquisition Merger.

Registration Statement and Extension Proxy Statement, the Company Group,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser Parties, on the other hand, shall hold and
shall cause their respective representatives to hold in strict confidence,
unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of Law, all documents and information concerning the other party
furnished to it by such other party or its representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the extent that
such information can be shown to have been (a) previously known by the party
to which it was furnished, (b) in the public domain through no fault of such
party or (c) later lawfully acquired from other sources, which source is not
the agent of the other party, by the party to which it was furnished), and
each party shall not use such information, except in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or release or disclose such
information to any other person, except its representatives in connection
with this Agreement. In the event that any party believes that it is required
to disclose any such confidential information pursuant to applicable Laws,
such party shall give timely written notice to the other parties so that such
parties may have an opportunity to obtain a protective order or other
appropriate relief. Each party shall be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations to hold confidential information concerning or supplied by the
other parties if it exercises the same care as it takes to preserve
confidentiality for its own similar information, but in no event with
less than a commercially reasonable degree of care. The parties acknowledge
that some previously confidential information will be required to be
disclosed in the Proxy Statement.

(a) Concurrently with or prior to the Closing, each party will use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that:

Shares in the public market,

  



  

such that, in the aggregate, Purchaser has no less than $15,000,000 in cash
and cash equivalents available to it immediately after the Closing, including
the proceeds from the Trust Fund (after payment of the amounts set forth in
clauses (i) to (iii) of _Section 7.7_ above) and the net proceeds from the
PIPE Transaction and/or such other private placement.

  



  

(b) Without limiting _Section 8.7(a)_ above, Parent and the Purchaser shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the PIPE Transaction on the terms set forth
in the PIPE Documents, including using Parent's and the Purchaser's
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the
PIPE Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions to obtaining the PIPE Transaction set forth in the PIPE
Documents that are applicable to Parent, the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries and within the control of Parent, the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, and to consummate the PIPE Transaction at or prior to the

Transaction at the Closing, (iii) comply on a timely basis with Parent's and
the Purchaser's obligations under the PIPE Documents, and (iv) enforce
Parent's and the Purchaser's rights under the PIPE Documents, including (if
requested by the Company) by assigning the rights of Parent or the Purchaser
to bring such lawsuits to the Company so as to enable the Company to file
such lawsuits against the investors on behalf of Parent or the Purchaser.
Parent shall provide the Company with copies of all documents relating to the
PIPE Transaction and shall give the Company prompt written notice upon
becoming aware of (A) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any of the
PIPE Documents, (B) any actual or potential failure to carry out any of the
terms of any of the PIPE Documents, (C) any actual or threatened termination
or repudiation of any of the PIPE Documents by any party thereto, (D) any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties to any of
the PIPE Documents or (E) the occurrence of an event or development that
Parent reasonably expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability
of Parent or the Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of the PIPE
Transaction. Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither
Parent nor the Purchaser shall permit any material amendment or modification
to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, any
of the PIPE Documents (including, without limitation, any amendment,
modification or waiver that (v) adversely affects the availability of all or
any portion of the PIPE Transaction, (w) adversely affects the termination
provisions of, or would result in the termination of, any of the PIPE
Documents, (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the PIPE Transaction, (y)
imposes additional conditions precedent to the availability of the PIPE
Transaction or amends or modifies any of the existing conditions to the
funding of the PIPE Transaction, or (z) adversely impacts the ability of

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
Company or the Purchaser shall be permitted to negotiate, enter into
definitive agreements for and consummate prior to or after the Closing the
repurchase of shares of Company Capital Stock (or shares of Purchaser Common

Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or under
any indemnification, employment or other similar agreements between any DandO
Indemnified Person and any of the Purchaser Parties or the Company Group in
effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the
Reincorporation Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Organizational
Documents of Purchaser and the Company Group to contain provisions no less

the Company Group to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The provisions

Persons with respect to claims arising from acts, events or omissions that
occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _D andO Tail Insurance_"),
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in
the aggregate than Parent's or the Company Group's existing policy or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage. The premium for such tail insurance policy shall be paid
for by the Surviving Corporation; provided that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this Section 8.8(b) an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the amount
per annum the Parent and the Company Group paid in their last full fiscal
year, which amount is set forth in Schedule 8.8(b). Parent shall cause such
DandO Tail Insurance to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause the other Purchaser Parties to honor all obligations

this _Section 8.8_.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 8.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and may

Company and such Stockholder). The provisions of this Section 8.9(b) are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, such

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_ and from and
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser, each of its Affiliates and each of its
and their respective members, managers, partners, directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, attorneys and agents and permitted assigns (the "
_Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless
against and in respect of any and all out-of-pocket loss, cost, payment,
demand, penalty, forfeiture, expense, liability, judgment, deficiency or
damage (including actual costs of investigation and attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses) (all of the foregoing collectively, " _Losses_ ")
incurred or sustained by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of or
in connection with any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company Group
contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall assert any claim, and shall not be entitled to indemnification,
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses indemnifiable hereunder
exceeds an amount equal to $560,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which event the
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for the aggregate amount of
all Losses in excess of the Threshold, and (ii) any liability incurred
pursuant to the terms of this _Article X_ shall be paid solely by the return
for cancellation of the Escrow Shares in accordance with the terms and
conditions of an escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing between
the Purchaser, the Company, the Stockholders' Representative, and Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_ and from and
after the Closing Date, the Stockholders (other than the Bridge Lender in its
capacity as the holder of the Bridge Loan Shares), each of their respective
Affiliates and each of their respective members, managers, partners,
directors, officers, employees, stockholders, attorneys and agents and
permitted assigns (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ " and the Company
Indemnified Parties or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as applicable, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless against and
in respect of any and all Losses incurred or sustained by the Company
Indemnified Parties as a result of or in connection with any breach,
inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties and
covenants of the Purchaser Parties contained herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) no Company Indemnified Party shall assert any claim, and shall
not be entitled to indemnification, unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Losses indemnifiable hereunder exceeds the Threshold, in which event the
Company Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for the aggregate amount
of all Losses in excess of the Threshold, and (ii) any liability incurred
pursuant to the terms of this _Article X_ shall be paid solely by the
issuance of shares of the Purchaser Common Stock. In no event shall the
Purchaser Indemnifying Parties' aggregate indemnification obligations under
this Agreement exceed a number of newly issued shares of Purchaser Common
Stock equal to the initial number of Escrow Shares (as appropriately adjusted
to reflect any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or
similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock)
(the " _Reserve Shares_ ").

  



  

(c) In no event shall "Losses" recoverable under this Agreement be deemed to
include (i) indirect, incidental or consequential damages, lost profits,
diminution in value, business interruption, special or punitive damages and,
in particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses,
(ii) any damages caused by a change in law, administrative practice, the
making of any legislation, the withdrawal of extra statutory concession
previously made by any taxation or revenue authority or published
interpretation of the law, after the date of this Agreement including any
increase in the rates of taxation, or any imposition of any Tax or any
withdrawal of relief from taxation not in effect at the date of this
Agreement whether or not the change purports to be effective retrospectively

of any party after the date of this Agreement.

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

10.2 _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by an
Indemnified Party for indemnification:

  



  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders' Representative, in the
case of a claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or the Purchaser, in the
case of a claim by a Company Indemnified Party, prompt notice (an "
_Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party action with respect to which
such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1_ (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in reasonable detail the Loss
that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. The failure to
give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of the rights or benefits
of such Indemnified Party under _Sections 11.1_ and _11.2_ , except to the
extent such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the
Stockholders, in the case of a claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or the
Purchaser, in the case of a claim by a Company Indemnified Party (in such
capacity, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") to defend such claim or increases the
amount of such liability.

  



  

(b) In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is
sought by an Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at
the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying Parties (provided that the
Indemnifying Parties shall not be responsible for attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses, except for the reasonable fees and expenses of one firm
acting as counsel to the Indemnified Parties and one firm acting as local
counsel, if necessary), to exercise full control of the defense, compromise
or settlement of any Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Parties, within
a reasonable time after the giving of an Indemnification Notice by such
Indemnified Party (but in any event within ten (10) days thereafter), shall
(i) notify such Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the
Indemnifying Parties to assume the defense thereof, and (ii) retain legal
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to conduct the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ , then the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably requested in
connection with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to be kept fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their legal counsel
with respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not
inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof, and
in any such case the reasonable fees and expenses of one firm acting as such
separate counsel and one firm acting as local counsel, if necessary, shall be
borne by the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall not
pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such
asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from or fail to
vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a
judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the
Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties fail to adequately
prosecute or withdraw such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying
Parties' expense (provided that the Indemnifying Parties shall not be
responsible for attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses, except for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one firm acting as counsel to the Indemnified
Parties and one firm acting as local counsel, if necessary). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be entitled to
control, but may participate in, and the Indemnified Party (at the expense of
the Indemnifying Parties, provided that the Indemnifying Parties shall not be
responsible for attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses, except for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one firm acting as counsel to the Indemnified
Parties and one firm acting as local counsel, if necessary) shall be entitled
to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x) that part of any
Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary
or permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified
Party, or (ii) to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves criminal
allegations against the Indemnified Party or (y) the entire Third-Party Claim
if such Third-Party Claim would impose liability on the part of the
Indemnified Party in an amount which is greater than twice the amount as to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement. In the event the Indemnified Party retains control of the Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(e) If an Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and proposes to settle the same prior to a
final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto, then the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice
thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate in
the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or prosecute such
appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties' expense. The
Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) settle or compromise or consent to entry of
any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any
relief other than the payment of money damages is or may be sought against
such Indemnified Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be
reasonably expected to impose or create a monetary liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party (such as an increase in the Indemnified Party's income
Tax), other than the monetary claim of the third party in such Third-
Party Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement or judgment and other than
a monetary claim for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder, or
(iii) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant, person conducting such investigation or initiating such
hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to such Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and all other actions
(known or unknown) arising or which might arise out of the same facts.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(f) Following the Closing, the disinterested independent directors of the
Purchaser shall have the authority to institute and prosecute any claims for
indemnification hereunder in good faith on behalf of the Purchaser to enforce
the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

10.3 _Escrow of Escrow Shares by Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) _Establishment of Escrow_. The Company Group and the Stockholders'
Representative hereby authorize the Purchaser to deliver the Escrow Shares to
the Escrow Agent to hold in escrow (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares shall be allocated among the Stockholders
(other than the Bridge Lender in its capacity as the holder of the Bridge
Loan Shares) in proportion to the number of Closing Shares actually issued to
each such Stockholder in the Acquisition Merger.

  



  

(b) _Escrow Shares; Payment of Dividends; Voting_. Any dividends, interest
payments, or other distributions made in respect of the Escrow Shares, other
than dividends or distributions payable in cash, will be delivered promptly to
the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow. The Stockholders shall be entitled to
vote the Escrow Shares on any matters to come before the stockholders of the
Purchaser.

  



  

(c) _Distribution of Escrow Shares_. At the times provided for in _Section
10.3(d)_ , the Escrow Shares shall be released and transferred by the Escrow
Agent to the Stockholders' Representative for distribution to the Stockholders
(other than the Bridge Lender in its capacity as the holder of the Bridge
Loan Shares). The Escrow Shares shall be distributed among the Stockholders
(other than the Bridge Lender in its capacity as the holder of the Bridge
Loan Shares) in proportion to the number of Closing Shares actually issued to
each such Stockholder in the Acquisition Merger. The Purchaser will take such
action as may be necessary to cause such securities to be issued in the names
of the appropriate persons. Certificates representing Escrow Shares so issued
that are subject to resale restrictions under applicable securities laws will
bear a legend to that effect. No fractional shares shall be released and
delivered from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders' Representative and all
fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(d) _Assignability_. No Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest therein may
be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law, by
the Stockholders or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of the Stockholders, prior to the
transfer and delivery to such Stockholders of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow
Agent as provided herein.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(e) _Release from Escrow Fund_. Within five (5) business days following
expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Release Date_ "), the Escrow Shares
will be released from escrow to the Stockholders' Representative less the
number or amount of Escrow Shares (valued at the then market value per share)
equal to the amount of any potential Losses set forth in any Indemnification
Notice from the Purchaser with respect to any pending but unresolved claim
for indemnification. Prior to the Release Date, the
Stockholders' Representative shall issue to the Escrow Agent a certificate
executed by him (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) instructing the Escrow Agent to release such number of Escrow Shares
determined in accordance with this _Section 10.3(d)_. Any Escrow Shares
retained in escrow as a result of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
released and transferred to the Stockholders' Representative promptly upon
resolution of the related claim for indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article X_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any indemnification payments will be made to Purchaser or
its successors. Any Escrow Shares received by Purchaser as an indemnification
payment shall be promptly cancelled by Purchaser after its receipt thereof.

  



  

10.4 _Payment of Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) In the event that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be paid exclusively from the Escrow Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, with such Escrow Shares valued at a price
per share equal to the five-day trailing average of the mean of the high and
low trading prices of Purchaser Common Stock as of the five trading days
immediately preceding the satisfaction of such Losses.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Company Indemnified Parties are entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Company Indemnified
Parties shall be paid exclusively through the issuance of Reserve Shares. Once
a Loss payable to the Company Indemnified Parties is agreed to by the
Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser, or finally adjudicated to be
payable pursuant to this  _Article X_ , then the Parent shall promptly issue
to the Company Indemnified Parties such number of Reserve Shares equal to the
dollar value of the Loss, with such Reserve Shares valued at a price per share
equal to the five-day trailing average of the mean of the high and low
trading prices of Purchaser Common Stock as of the five trading days
immediately preceding the satisfaction of such Losses. In the event the
Reserve Shares are payable to the Stockholders, the Reserve Shares shall be
distributed among the Stockholders in proportion to the number of Closing
Shares actually issued to each of the Stockholders in the Acquisition Merger.

  



  

(c) In no event shall the Company Indemnifying Parties' aggregate
indemnification obligations under this _Article X_ exceed the number of
Escrow Shares or the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties aggregate indemnification
obligations under this _Article X_  exceed the number of Reserve Shares.

  



  

10.5 _Insurance_. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take into
account any insurance proceeds or other third-party reimbursement
actually received. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ are covered by insurance of the
Indemnified Party or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery
under such insurance; however, the Indemnified Party will nevertheless be
entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under this _Article X_ in
respect of such Losses. The existence of a claim by an Indemnified Party
for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss
will toll any disbursement of the Escrow Fund or any issuance of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, pursuant to
the indemnification provisions contained in this _Article X_ and the Escrow
Agreement, if applicable. To the extent an Indemnified Party receives proceeds
from insurance or other amounts in respect of such Loss, such proceeds shall
reduce the amount of Losses subject to indemnification
hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the
intention of the parties that no insurer or any other third party will be (a)
entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of
the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (b) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  



  

10.6 _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. All representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits hereto and
all certificates, documents, instruments and undertakings furnished pursuant
to this Agreement) shall survive until twelve (12) months following the
Closing (the " _Survival Period_ "). After the expiration of the Survival
Period, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no further liability for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ other than with respect to the
claims already made pursuant to this _Article X_.

  



  

10.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided in this _Article X_
shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties,
from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any and all claims arising
out of or related to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained
in this _Article X_ shall in any way impair, modify, or otherwise limit a
Party's right to bring any Fraud Claim, and any such Fraud Claim shall not be
subject to the Threshold.

  



  

10.8 _Adjustment to Consideration_. Amounts paid for indemnification under
this _Article X_ will be deemed to be an adjustment to the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

ARTICLE XI 
 DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  



  

11.1 _Arbitration_.

  



  

(a) Except for any action where a party seeks an injunction or specific
performance in accordance with the Section 13.2, the parties shall promptly
submit any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect, validity,
termination, interpretation, performance, or enforcement of this Agreement) or
any alleged breach thereof (including any action in tort, contract, equity,
or otherwise) or the transactions contemplated thereby, to binding
arbitration before one arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "). Except for any
action where a party seeks an injunction or specific performance in
accordance with the Section 13.2, binding arbitration shall be the sole means
of resolving any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to
this Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect, validity,
termination, interpretation, performance or enforcement of this Agreement) or
any alleged breach thereof (including any claim in tort, contract, equity, or
otherwise).

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(b) If the parties cannot agree upon the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall be

Arbitration Association upon the written request of either side. The
Arbitrator shall be selected within thirty (30) days of such written request.

  



  

(c) The laws of the State of Delaware shall apply to any arbitration
hereunder. In any arbitration hereunder, this Agreement shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a contract negotiated, signed,
and wholly to be performed in the State of Delaware, which laws the
Arbitrator shall apply in rendering his decision. The Arbitrator shall issue a
written decision, setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law,
within sixty (60) days after he shall have been selected. The Arbitrator shall
have no authority to award punitive or other exemplary damages.

  



  

(d) The arbitration shall be held in San Diego, California in accordance with
and under the then-current provisions of the rules of the American

discovery to the same extent as would be provided under the Federal Rules of

shall limit any discovery or evidence such that his decision shall be rendered
within the period referred to in _Section 11.1(c)_.

  



  

(f) The Arbitrator may, at his discretion and at the expense of the party who
will bear the cost of the arbitration, employ experts to assist him in his
determinations.

  



  

(g) The costs of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to
confirm any arbitration award (including actual attorneys' fees and costs)
shall be borne by the unsuccessful party and shall be awarded as part of the
Arbitrator's decision, unless the Arbitrator shall otherwise allocate such
costs in such decision. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in
and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties expressly
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state) in
California to enforce any award of the Arbitrator or to render any
provisional, temporary, or injunctive relief in connection with or in aid of
the arbitration. The parties expressly consent to the personal and subject
matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters to be
submitted to arbitration hereunder. None of the parties hereto shall
challenge any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary to
such arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been absent from
such arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall have been
the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

  



  

(i) The parties shall indemnify the Arbitrator and any experts employed by
the Arbitrator and hold them harmless from and against any claim or demand
arising out of any arbitration under this Agreement, unless resulting from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the person indemnified.

  



  

(j) This arbitration section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

11.2 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Exemplary Damages_.

  



  

(a) For any action where a party seeks an injunction or specific performance
in accordance with the Section 13.2, each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts (Federal and
state) in California in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, agrees that process
may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
California for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead
any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and
manner of service of process. For any action where a party seeks an
injunction or specific performance in accordance with the Section 13.2, each
party hereto hereby agrees not to commence any legal proceedings relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in
any jurisdiction or courts other than as provided herein.

  



  

(b) THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EACH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, IN ANY COURT IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE
COMMENCED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT, OR BY REASON OF ANY OTHER CAUSE OR DISPUTE WHATSOEVER
BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT OF ANY KIND OR NATURE.
NO PARTY SHALL BE AWARDED PUNITIVE OR OTHER EXEMPLARY DAMAGES RESPECTING ANY
DISPUTE ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT.

represented in connection with the signing of this waiver by
independent legal counsel selected by the respective party and that such
party has discussed the legal consequences and import of this waiver with
legal counsel. Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledge that
each has read and understands the meaning of this waiver and grants this
waiver knowingly, voluntarily, without duress and only after consideration of
the consequences of this waiver with legal counsel.

13.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each of
the Purchaser, the Parent (prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time), the
Company and the Stockholders' Representative, and cannot be terminated orally
or by course of conduct. No provision hereof can be waived, except by a
writing signed by the party against whom such waiver is to be enforced, and
any such waiver shall apply only in the particular instance in which such
waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to
or demand on a party shall waive or otherwise affect any obligation of that
party or impair any right of the party giving such notice or making such
demand, including any right to take any action without notice or demand
not otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy
with respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any
other right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with
respect to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to any other breach.

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including in _Article X_ ,
no statement herein of any right or remedy shall impair any other right or
remedy stated herein or that otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any party
seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages, under
any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach
(or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

(e) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
13.2_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction.

  



  

13.3 _Arm 's Length Bargaining; No Presumption Against Drafter_. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the
opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made based
upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

  



  

13.4 _Publicity_. Except as required by law and except with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, the parties agree that neither they nor their
agents shall issue any press release or make any other public disclosure
concerning the transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval
of the other party hereto. If a party is required to make such a disclosure as
required by law, the parties will use their best efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or public disclosure to be issued.

  



  

13.5 _Expenses_. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
unless otherwise specified herein.

  



  

13.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or delegate
any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation, operation of
law, or otherwise, without the written consent of the other party. Any
purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void, in
addition to constituting a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

   

81

 



    



  

13.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

13.8 _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon
delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to
each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature
pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures of all
other parties.

  



  

13.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Additional
Agreements, including any exhibits and schedules attached hereto or thereto,
sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
understandings and agreements related thereto (whether written or oral), all
of which are merged herein. No provision of this Agreement or any Additional
Agreement, including any exhibits and schedules attached hereto or thereto
may be explained or qualified by any agreement, negotiations, understanding,
discussion, conduct or course of conduct or by any trade usage. Except as
otherwise expressly stated herein or any Additional Agreement, there is no
condition precedent to the effectiveness of any provision hereof or thereof.
No party has relied on any representation from, or warranty or agreement of,
any person in entering into this Agreement, prior hereto or contemporaneous
herewith or any Additional Agreement, except those expressly stated herein or
therein.

  



  

13.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

  



  

13.11 _Construction of Certain Terms and References; Captions_. In this
Agreement:

  



  

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and
exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and
subsections, schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means a
party signatory hereto.

  



  

(c) Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine, or neuter
gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires;
"including" means "including without limitation;" "or" means "and/or;" "any"
means "any one, more than one, or all;" and, unless otherwise specified, any
financial or accounting term has the meaning of the term under United States
generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied
heretofore by the Company Group.

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

(d) Unless otherwise specified, any reference to any agreement (including
this Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all
schedules, exhibits, or other attachments referred to therein, and any
reference to a statute or other law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance,
or the like promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended, restated,
supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time.

  



  

(e) Any reference to a numbered schedule means the same-numbered section of
the disclosure schedule. The information furnished in the Schedule 5 and
Schedule 6 is arranged in sections corresponding to the sections of this
Agreement, and the disclosures in any section of the schedules shall qualify
(a) the corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) other sections of this
Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-
reference), that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure
is also applicable to such other sections of this Agreement. The schedules
and the information and disclosures contained in such schedules are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the
scope of any such representation or warranty. The inclusion of any information
in the schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment
that such information is material or outside the ordinary course of
business. The inclusion of any fact or information in a schedule is not
intended to be construed as an admission or concession as to the legal effect
of any such fact or information in any proceeding between any party and any
Person who is not a party.

  



  

(f) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given
within a specified number of days following a specific date or event, the day
of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for such
action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required
to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business Day, such
action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or
before the next Business Day.

  



  

(g) Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for
convenience, only.

  



  

(h) For the avoidance of any doubt, (i) all references in this Agreement to
"the knowledge of the Company" or "knowledge of the Company Group" or similar
terms shall be deemed to include the actual knowledge of Gregory Poilasne, Ted
Smith and the other executive officers of the Company and (ii) all references
to the "knowledge of the Parent" or "knowledge of the Purchaser" or similar
terms shall be deemed to include the actual knowledge of the officers of
Parent.

  



  

13.12 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver such
documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the
scope of such party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

13.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any Person not
a signatory hereto.

  



  

   

83

 



    



  

13.14 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final IPO prospectus of the Parent,
dated February 13, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company Group has read
the Prospectus and understand that the Parent has established the Trust
Account for the benefit of the public shareholders of the Parent and the
underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except for a
portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, the
Parent may disburse monies from the Trust Account only for the purposes set
forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Parent agreeing
to enter into this Agreement, the Company Group hereby agrees that it does
not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
in the Trust Account and hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against

been adopted prior to the Closing; provided, further, that if any amendment
disproportionately and adversely impacts a Stockholder (or group of
Stockholders), the written consent of such disproportionately impacted
Stockholder (or group of Stockholders) shall also be required. The
Stockholders' Representative may be removed by the Stockholders from time to
time upon no less than twenty (20) days' prior written notice to the
Purchaser Parties and, if after the Closing, the Purchaser, provided, however,

not be effective until written notice is delivered to the Parent or Purchaser,
as applicable. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders' Representative,

business judgment. In connection with the performance of his rights and
obligations hereunder, the Stockholders' Representative shall have the right

pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs incurred by
