and payment terms thereof, whether it is a &ldquo;claims made&rdquo; or an &ldquo;occurrence&rdquo; policy and a brief identification

effect that insure the property, assets or business of the Company Group or its employees (other than self-obtained insurance policies
by such employees). Each such insurance policy is valid and binding and in full force and effect, all premiums due thereunder have
been paid and the Company Group has not received any notice of cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy or default
thereunder. The Company Group believes such insurance policies, in light of the nature of the Company Group&rsquo;s business, assets
and properties, are in amounts and have coverage that are reasonable and customary for Persons engaged in such business and having
such assets and properties. Neither the Company Group, nor, to the knowledge of the Company Group, the Person to whom such policy
has been issued, has received notice that any insurer under any policy referred to in this <U>Section 5.17</U> is denying liability
with respect to a claim thereunder or defending under a reservation of rights clause. Within the last two (2) years, the Company
Group has not filed for any claims exceeding $2,000,000 against any of its insurance policies, exclusive of automobile and health
insurance policies. The Company Group has not received written notice from any of its insurance carriers or brokers that any premiums
will be materially increased in the future, and does not have any reason to believe that any insurance coverage listed on Schedule
5.17 will not be available in the future on substantially the same terms as now in effect.</P>

Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, which information provided by the Parent shall be true and
correct in all material respects and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made not materially misleading. The Purchaser Parties, with the assistance and written approval
of the Company Group, will promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement and will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act and the Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to

of the Indemnified Party or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss will toll any disbursement of the Escrow Fund or any issuance
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained
in this <U>Article X</U> and the Escrow Agreement, if applicable. To the extent an Indemnified Party receives proceeds from insurance
or other amounts in respect of such Loss, such proceeds shall reduce the amount of Losses subject to indemnification hereunder.

will be (a) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions,

set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Parent agreeing to enter into this Agreement, the Company Group
hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and
hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may have in the future as a result of,
or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with the Purchaser.</P>

Representative in connection with this Agreement and the Additional Agreements, including the power (i) to enter into and deliver
the Escrow Agreement and the Earn-out Escrow Agreement on behalf of each of the Stockholders (other than the Bridge Lender in its
capacity as the holder of the Bridge Loan Shares), (ii) to make all determinations and issue all notices pursuant to <U>Section
4.4</U> above and the Earn-out Escrow Agreement on behalf of each of the Stockholders (other than the Bridge Lender in its capacity
as the holder of the Bridge Loan Shares), (ii) to defend, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with claims under <U>Article X</U>
hereof and under the Escrow Agreement on behalf of each of the Stockholders (other than the Bridge Lender in its capacity as the
holder of the Bridge Loan Shares), (iii) to defend, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any other litigation or dispute involving
this Agreement, and (iv) after the Closing, to amend this Agreement; provided, that, unless the Stockholder Representative receives
the written consent of 51% of all of the shares of Company Common Stock on an as-if converted basis outstanding immediately prior
to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative shall not enter into an amendment to
this Agreement that would have required the approval of the Stockholders under applicable Law if it had been adopted prior to the
Closing; provided, further, that if any amendment disproportionately and adversely impacts a Stockholder (or group of Stockholders),
the written consent of such disproportionately impacted Stockholder (or group of Stockholders) shall also be required. The Stockholders&rsquo;
Representative may be removed by the Stockholders from time to time upon no less than twenty (20) days&rsquo; prior written notice
to the Purchaser Parties and, if after the Closing, the Purchaser, provided, however, that the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative
may not be removed unless holders of at least 51% of all of the shares of Company Common Stock on an as-if converted basis outstanding
immediately prior to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement agree to such removal. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholders&rsquo;
Representative may be filled by approval of the holders of at least 51% of all of the shares of Company Common Stock on an as-if
converted basis outstanding immediately prior to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Any removal or change of the Stockholders&rsquo;
Representative shall not be effective until written notice is delivered to the Parent or Purchaser, as applicable. No bond shall
be required of the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative, and the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative shall not receive any compensation
for his services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative shall constitute notice to or from
the Stockholders. The Stockholders&rsquo; Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder while acting
in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable business judgment. In connection with the performance of his rights and obligations
hereunder, the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative shall have the right at any time and from time to time to select and engage attorneys,
accountants, investment bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel and obtain such other professional and expert assistance,
maintain such records and incur other out-of-pocket expenses, as the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative may deem necessary or desirable
from time to time, at the cost and expense of the Company, but subject to the indemnification obligations of <U>Article X</U>.
The Company shall indemnify the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative and hold it harmless against any Loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and
other legal costs incurred by the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders&rsquo;
Representative shall, for all purposes hereunder, constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all of the Stockholders
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Stockholders. The appointment of the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative
will be deemed coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative,
and shall survive the death, incapacity, or bankruptcy of any Stockholder. The provisions of this <U>Section 13.15</U> shall be
binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and successors of each Stockholder.
All of the indemnities, immunities, rights, releases and powers granted to the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative under this Agreement
