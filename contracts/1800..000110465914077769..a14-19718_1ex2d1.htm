 **ARTICLE 2**

 



 

 **BUSINESS TRANSFER; THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Business Transfer_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, (i) Abbott shall cause the Share Sellers to sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to New Mylan, free and clear of all Encumbrances,
and New Mylan shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Share Sellers, all
of Abbotts and the Share Sellers right, title and interest in and to the
Acquired Shares and (ii) Abbott shall cause the French Business IP Seller to
sell, assign and transfer to New Mylan, free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than Permitted Encumbrances), and New Mylan shall purchase, acquire and
accept from the French Business IP Seller, all of the French Business IP
Sellers right, title and interest in and to the French Business IP Assets.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, in consideration for the Business Transfer, New Mylan shall
issue and deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Share Sellers and the
French Business IP Seller, as applicable, an aggregate of 110,000,000 New
Mylan Ordinary Shares (the " _Consideration Shares_ "). Such issuance and
delivery shall be in accordance with the Final Share Allocation. New Mylan
shall not be entitled to deduct and withhold any amount from the Consideration
Shares for any applicable withholding Tax otherwise due under any Tax Law.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, in consideration for the Business Transfer and without any
further action on the part of the Share Sellers or the French Business IP
Seller, the Share Sellers and the French Business IP Seller shall be deemed to
have subscribed hereunder for the Consideration Shares to be issued to the
Share Sellers and the French Business IP Seller in accordance with the Final
Share Allocation. In accordance with the Laws of the Netherlands, the Share
Sellers and the French Business IP Seller, as a result of such deemed
subscription, shall be obligated to pay up the Consideration Shares in an
amount, determined solely for the purpose of satisfying such obligation, equal
to the Dutch Compensation Amount to which the Share Sellers and the French
Business IP Seller are entitled at the Closing, in consideration for the
Business Transfer. The obligation to pay up the Consideration Shares shall be
set-off against the right to receive the Dutch Compensation Amount.

 



 

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Dutch Compensation Amount_ " means
the amount equal to the Euro par value amount required to satisfy the pay up
obligation resulting from the deemed subscription by the Share Sellers and the
French Business IP Seller of the amount of New Mylan Ordinary Shares to be
issued to the Share Sellers and the French Business IP Seller in accordance
with this _Section 2.1_.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, New Mylan shall engage an
institution satisfactory to Mylan to act as exchange agent in connection with
the Merger and to deliver the Merger Consideration to the shareholders of
Mylan (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

 



 

2.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with Section 1921 et seq. of the PBCL,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Mylan at the Effective Time.
Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and Mylan shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



 

2.4 _Effective Time_. Upon the Closing, Merger Sub and Mylan shall (a) file
articles of merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL and (b) make
all other filings or recordings required under the PBCL. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with
the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or at such
subsequent time as Mylan and Abbott shall agree and as shall be specified in
the Articles of Merger, but in no event prior to the completion of the
transactions set forth in _Section 2.1_ (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

2.5 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the PBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and

 



      
 

 



 

subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Mylan and Merger Sub shall be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, all Liabilities of Mylan and Merger Sub shall become the
Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and New Mylan shall own, directly or
indirectly, all of the Equity Rights and issued and outstanding Securities of
the Surviving Corporation and the Mylan Subsidiaries (excluding, from and
after the Effective Time, New Mylan).

 



 

2.6 _Governing Documents_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth
on _Exhibit A_. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Mylan and New Mylan shall take, or cause to be taken, such actions as are
necessary so that, effective as of the Effective Time, the Articles of
Association of New Mylan shall be amended and restated to read in their
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit B_.

 



 

(c) Mylan and New Mylan shall take, or cause to be taken, such actions as are
necessary so that, as of the Effective Time, the Additional Matters shall have
been implemented.

 



 

2.7 _Officers and Directors_. The officers of Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise
ceasing to be an officer or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The directors of Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, which individuals shall serve as directors of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified.

 



 

2.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or any of their respective
shareholders:

 



 

(a) Each share of Mylan Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and all rights in respect thereof, shall be canceled
and automatically converted into and become the right to receive one New Mylan
Ordinary Share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). As a result of the Merger, at the
Effective Time, each holder of a Mylan Certificate shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Mylan Common Stock represented by such
Mylan Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_ , all to be delivered
or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Mylan Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.9(b)_ (or, in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed Mylan Certificate, _Section 2.9(i)_ ), collectively,
referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". Each share of Mylan Common
Stock held in treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no distribution
shall be made with respect thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and all rights in respect thereof, shall be
canceled and retired.

 



 

2.9 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, immediately
following the Effective Time and as consideration for the Merger, New Mylan
shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent, solely for the account and
benefit of the former shareholders of Mylan, a number of New Mylan Ordinary
Shares equal to the total number of shares of Mylan Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger for delivery to holders of Mylan Certificates
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_. In
addition, New Mylan shall make available by depositing with the Exchange
Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in an
amount sufficient to make the payments in respect of any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of New Mylan Ordinary Shares may be
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_. All cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent and the New Mylan Ordinary Shares delivered to the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". At the
Effective Time, the respective obligations of New Mylan, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent under this _Section 2.9_ shall be
unconditional.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, New Mylan
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate representing outstanding shares of Mylan Common Stock or shares of
Mylan Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form, in each case,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (either case being referred to
in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as the " _Mylan Certificates_ "),
which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ , (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that
risk of loss and title to the Mylan Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Mylan Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to New Mylan and Mylan) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Mylan Certificates in
exchange for New Mylan Ordinary Shares and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_. Upon surrender of Mylan
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Mylan Certificates shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor that number of New Mylan Ordinary Shares
(after taking into account all Mylan Certificates surrendered by such holder)
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_ , and the
Mylan Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of Mylan Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Mylan, the proper number of New Mylan
Ordinary Shares may be delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Mylan Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Mylan
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such transfer shall pay any Transfer Taxes
or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of New Mylan Ordinary Shares
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Mylan Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of

 



      
 

 



 

New Mylan that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.9(b)_ , each Mylan Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such surrender. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to this _Section
2.9_

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to New Mylan Ordinary
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Mylan Certificate with respect to the New Mylan Ordinary
Shares represented thereby until such Mylan Certificate has been surrendered
in accordance with this _Section 2.9_. Subject to applicable Law and the
provisions of this _Section 2.9_ , following surrender of any such Mylan
Certificate, there shall be transferred or paid to the record holder thereof
by the Exchange Agent, without interest, promptly after such surrender, the
number of New Mylan Ordinary Shares transferrable in exchange therefor
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such New Mylan Ordinary Shares.

 



 

(d) All New Mylan Ordinary Shares transferred upon the surrender for exchange
of Mylan Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall
be deemed to have been transferred (or paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Mylan Common Stock previously represented
by such Mylan Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Mylan shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Mylan Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Mylan Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which has not been transferred to the
holders of Mylan Certificates as of the one year anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to New Mylan or its designee, upon demand, and the New
Mylan Ordinary Shares included therein shall be sold at the best price
reasonably obtainable at that time. Any holder of Mylan Certificates who has
not complied with this _Article 2_ prior to the one year anniversary of the
Effective Time shall thereafter look only to New Mylan for payment of such
holders claim for the Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) but only as a general creditor for payment
of such holders portion of the cash proceeds of the sale of the New Mylan
Ordinary Shares.

 



 

(f) None of Abbott, the Share Sellers, the Acquired Companies or Acquired
Company Subsidiaries, New Mylan, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any New Mylan Ordinary Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by New Mylan on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no such investment
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former shareholders of
Mylan after the Effective Time pursuant to this _Article 2_. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment

 



      
 

 



 

shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall promptly be paid to New
Mylan.

 



 

(h) New Mylan and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a
holder of Mylan Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such
amounts as New Mylan or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by New Mylan or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(i) If any Mylan Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Mylan Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such New Mylan Ordinary Shares as may be required pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9(c) provided_ , that New Mylan may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to the delivery thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Mylan Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in a form reasonably satisfactory to New Mylan, or a bond in
such sum as New Mylan may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim
that may be made against New Mylan or the Exchange Agent in respect of the
Mylan Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.10 _Mylan Stock Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) Each Mylan Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Mylan Option, the number of New Mylan Ordinary Shares determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Mylan Common Stock subject to such Mylan
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per New Mylan Ordinary Share equal to (i) the exercise price
per share of Mylan Common Stock pursuant to such Mylan Option divided by (ii)
the Exchange Ratio (a " _New Mylan Option_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Mylan Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into a right to
receive, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Mylan Stock Award, the number of New Mylan Ordinary Shares
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Mylan Common Stock subject
to such Mylan Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio (a " _New Mylan Stock Award_ ").

 



 

(c) The adjustments provided in this _Section 2.10_ with respect to any Mylan
Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) are intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. The adjustments provided in this _Section 2.10_ with
respect to any Mylan Options that are not "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be made in a manner necessary to
comply with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Any shares of Mylan Common Stock that remain available for issuance
pursuant to the Mylan Stock Plan as of the Effective Time (the " _Residual
Shares_ ") shall be converted at the Effective Time into the number of New
Mylan Ordinary Shares equal to the product of the number of such Residual
Shares and the Exchange Ratio and following such conversion such New Mylan
Ordinary Shares shall be issuable under the Mylan Stock Plan (or a successor
thereto).

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, New Mylan shall assume all the obligations of Mylan
under the Mylan Stock Plan, each outstanding New Mylan Option and New Mylan
Stock Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, New Mylan shall deliver to the holders
of New Mylan Options and New Mylan Stock Awards appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
New Mylan Options and New Mylan Stock Awards shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
_Section 2.10_).

 



 

(f) New Mylan shall take all company action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of New Mylan Ordinary Shares for delivery upon exercise or
settlement of the New Mylan Options and New Mylan Stock Awards in accordance
with this _Section 2.10_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, New Mylan shall file a registration statement or registration
statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or, to the extent applicable, other
appropriate form) with respect to the New Mylan Ordinary Shares subject to New
Mylan Options and New Mylan Stock Awards and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such New Mylan Options and New
Mylan Stock Awards remain outstanding.

 



 

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Mylan
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Mylan Stock Plan) and New
Mylan shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be
reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section
2.10_.

 



 

2.11 _Allocation_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Abbott shall
prepare and deliver to New Mylan a proposed allocation of the Consideration
Shares among each of the Share Sellers (in respect of the transfer of each
Acquired Company) and the French Business IP Seller (the " _Share Allocation_
"). Such Share Allocation shall be based on Abbotts good faith estimate of
the relative fair market values of the assets of each Acquired Company and
Acquired Company Subsidiary deemed transferred for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes in the Reorganization, the French Business IP and any other assets
transferred or deemed transferred to New Mylan at the Closing. If New Mylan
does not deliver written notice of any dispute (an " _Allocation Dispute
Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Share Allocation, the
Parties agree that the Share Allocation shall be deemed the Final Share
Allocation for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the end of such thirty (30)
day period, New Mylan may accept the Share Allocation by delivering written
notice to that effect to Abbott, in which case the Share Allocation shall be
deemed the Final Share Allocation for all purposes

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder when such notice is given. If New Mylan delivers an Allocation
Dispute Notice to Abbott within such thirty (30) day period, Abbott and New
Mylan shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute during the
thirty (30) day period commencing on the date Abbott receives the Allocation
Dispute Notice from New Mylan. If Abbott and New Mylan do not agree upon a
final resolution with respect to the Share Allocation within such thirty (30)
day period, then the Share Allocation shall be submitted immediately to an
internationally recognized, independent accounting or valuation firm
reasonably acceptable to Abbott and New Mylan (the " _Allocation Firm_ "). The
Allocation Firm shall be requested to render a determination of the applicable
dispute within thirty (30) days after referral of the matter to such
Allocation Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The terms of the appointment and
engagement of the Allocation Firm shall be as mutually agreed upon between New
Mylan and Abbott. The determination of the Allocation Firm shall be final and
binding, absent manifest error. The dispute resolution under this _Section
2.11(a)_ shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article
76. Any fees payable to the Allocation Firm shall be borne equally by New
Mylan and Abbott. The Share Allocation accepted by Abbott and New Mylan or
determined by the Allocation Firm, as the case may be, shall be the " _Final
Share Allocation_ ". New Mylan and Abbott, on behalf of itself, the French
Business IP Seller and the Share Sellers, acknowledge that the Final Share
Allocation shall be done at arms length based upon a good faith determination
of fair market value.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that the value of the consideration allocated pursuant
to _Section 2.11(a)_ shall be equal to the number of Consideration Shares
allocated pursuant to the Final Share Allocation multiplied by the VWAP (such
allocation of values, the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ " and the aggregate of
all such values, the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation
together with the Final Share Allocation shall be the " _Final Allocations_ ".

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of New Mylan, Abbott
and each of their respective Affiliates shall be bound by the Final
Allocations for purposes of determining (i) the amount and value of
Consideration Shares received by each Share Seller and French Business IP
Seller, (ii) any Taxes related to the transfer of the Acquired Shares and
French Business IP Assets and (iii) any Taxes (including Transfer Taxes)
applicable to (x) the conveyance and transfer of the Transferred Business
Assets in the Reorganization and (y) the conveyance and transfer of New Mylan
Ordinary Shares from New Mylan to Abbott and its Affiliates. New Mylan and
Abbott shall prepare and file, and cause their respective Affiliates to
prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Final
Allocations. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, none of New
Mylan, Abbott or their respective Affiliates shall take any position
inconsistent with the Final Allocations in any Tax Return, in any Tax refund
claim, in any Action or otherwise unless required by a final determination by
an applicable Governmental Authority. If any Party, or any Affiliate of any
Party, receives notice from any Governmental Authority that such Governmental
Authority is disputing the Final Allocations, such Party shall promptly notify
the other Parties, and Abbott and New Mylan agree to use their reasonable best
efforts to defend such Final Allocations in any Action.

such director, officer, employee or agent, in his or her capacity as such, at
or prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(h) the certificate required by _Section 10.3(a)_.

 



 

3.4 _Modified Working Capital Determination and Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than seventy-five (75) days after the
Closing Date, New Mylan shall prepare and deliver to Abbott a good faith
calculation of Modified Working Capital, including the components thereof and
in a manner consistent with the definition thereof (the " _Modified Working
Capital Calculation_ ").

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Modified Working Capital Calculation, Abbott shall
have sixty (60) days to review the Modified Working Capital Calculation,
together with the work papers used in the preparation thereof and the other
written documentation supporting the basis of New Mylans determination of the
Modified Working Capital Calculation. During such sixty (60) day period, New
Mylan shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, upon reasonable
advance notice, provide Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates and their
respective representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours
and without unreasonable interference with the Mylan Parties and their
respective Affiliates operation to the books, records and employees engaged
in financial accounting and related functions for the Business as may be
reasonably necessary for Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates and their
respective representatives to evaluate the Modified Working Capital
Calculation and, if applicable, prepare written notice of any dispute
regarding the Modified Working Capital Calculation (a " _Dispute Notice_ ").
If Abbott does not deliver a Dispute Notice to New Mylan within sixty (60)
days after receipt of the Modified Working Capital Calculation, the Modified
Working Capital Calculation shall be deemed the Final Modified Working Capital
for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the end of such sixty (60) day period,
Abbott may accept the Modified Working Capital Calculation by delivering
written notice to that effect to New Mylan, in which case the Modified Working
Capital Calculation shall be deemed the Final Modified Working Capital for all
purposes hereunder when such notice is given. If Abbott delivers a Dispute
Notice to New Mylan within such sixty (60) day period, Abbott and New Mylan
shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute during the thirty
(30) day period commencing on the date New Mylan receives the

 



      
 

 



 

Dispute Notice from Abbott. Any Dispute Notice delivered pursuant to this
_Section 3.4(b)_ shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of
any disagreements. If Abbott and New Mylan do not agree upon a final
resolution with respect to any disputed items within such thirty (30) day
period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be submitted immediately to
an internationally recognized independent accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Abbott and New Mylan (in either case, the " _Consultant_ "). The
Consultant shall be requested to render a determination of the applicable
dispute within forty-five (45) days after referral of the matter to such
Consultant, which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis therefor. New Mylan shall cause the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to make their financial
records reasonably available to the Consultant in connection with such
determination. The terms of the appointment and engagement of the Consultant
shall be as mutually agreed upon between New Mylan and Abbott; _provided_ that
the Consultant shall under no circumstances be permitted to resolve (i) any
disputes not within the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Consultant
pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ or (ii) any disputes regarding the scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Consultant pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ ,
which such disputes shall in all cases be resolved in accordance with, and
subject to the limitations of, _Article 13_. In resolving disputed items, the
Consultant shall (A) make an independent calculation of the aggregate amount
of all such disputed items (the " _Consultant Amount_ ") and (B) resolve all
such items by choosing either (1) the aggregate amount for all such items set
forth in the Modified Working Capital Calculation (the " _New Mylan Proposed
Amount_ ") or (2) the aggregate amount for all such items set forth in the
Dispute Notice (the " _Abbott Proposed Amount_ "), based upon which aggregate
amount is closer to the Consultant Amount. The determination of the Consultant
shall be final and binding, absent manifest error. The dispute resolution
under this _Section 3.4(b)_ shall constitute an expert determination under New
York CPLR Article 76. Any fees payable to the Consultant shall be borne by (x)
Abbott, if the Consultant chooses the New Mylan Proposed Amount, or (y) New
Mylan, if the Consultant chooses the Abbott Proposed Amount. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses
incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder
before the Consultant shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost or
expense. New Mylan and Abbott shall revise the Modified Working Capital
Calculation to reflect the resolution of any disputes with respect thereto
pursuant to this _Section 3.4(b)_ and, as so revised, such Modified Working
Capital Calculation shall be deemed to set forth the final Modified Working
Capital for all purposes hereunder (the " _Final Modified Working Capital_ ").

 



 

(c) If the Final Modified Working Capital is less than $450,000,000, then
Abbott shall deliver to New Mylan at no charge additional finished Products
manufactured by Abbott and the Continuing Affiliates following Closing
pursuant to purchase orders submitted by New Mylan or its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries)
following the Closing in accordance with the applicable Manufacturing and
Supply Agreement with a value (as determined by the price payable as of the
delivery date under the applicable Manufacturing and Supply Agreement by the
applicable Acquired Company or Acquired Company Subsidiary to Abbott or the
applicable Continuing Affiliate, as denominated in local currency using the
Book Rate) equal to the amount of such deficit. Any products delivered to New
Mylan or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 3.4(c)_ shall be
manufactured and delivered in accordance with the applicable Manufacturing and
Supply Agreement. If the Final Modified Working Capital is greater than
$500,000,000, New Mylan shall pay to Abbott the amount of such excess by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account

 



       
 

 



 

designated by Abbott in writing in United States Dollars within three (3) U.S.
Business Days after the determination of the Final Modified Working Capital
pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_.

 



 

(d) If finished Products are delivered to New Mylan or its Affiliates pursuant
to _Section 3.4(c)_, the Final Allocations shall be amended as mutually
agreed by the Parties so that a portion of the Purchase Price is appropriately
allocated to such finished Products. If a payment is made by New Mylan to
Abbott pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_, however, the amount of such payment
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. The Final Allocations
shall be amended as mutually agreed by the Parties so that such adjustment is
appropriately allocated among the Share Sellers. The provisions of _Section
2.11(c)_ shall apply to the Final Allocations as amended by this _Section
3.4(d)_.

Acquired Company or any Acquired Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Securities or Equity Rights of any Acquired Company or
any Acquired Company Subsidiary. There are no proxies, voting trusts or other

any material respect _Section 7.1 (iv)(C)_, _(vii)_ or _(ix)_ or agreed or
committed to take any such action.

 



 

4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Action pending
or, to the Knowledge of Abbott, threatened against Abbott or any Affiliate of
Abbott with respect to the Business that, individually or in the aggregate,

Effect. There is no Order outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of Abbott,
allegation or investigation by any Governmental Authority involving Abbott or
any Affiliate of Abbott in respect of the Business that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.9 _Intellectual Property_.

Material Adverse Effect, Abbott or one of its Affiliates has good and
marketable title to, and owns solely and exclusively, free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), the

 



      
 

 



 

Transferred Patents and Transferred Trademarks. The Transferred Patents and
Transferred Trademarks are subsisting and have not expired or been cancelled.

 



 

(b) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect,
(i) the operation of the Business as currently conducted (including the
manufacture, offer for sale, sale, importation or use of any Product
manufactured, marketed, licensed (or sublicensed), sold, imported or used by
Abbott or any of its Affiliates) does not infringe upon or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property right of any third party to which neither Abbott nor any

Abbott, no third party is infringing upon or misappropriating any Transferred
Intellectual Property or any other Intellectual Property used in, or related
to, the Business; and (iii) there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of

owns, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances),
all Registrations required to develop, manufacture, distribute, package,
store, transport, market, promote, use, sell or offer for sale the Products in
or for the Territories (the " _Product Registrations_ "), except where failure
to hold such Product Registrations, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of Abbott, each Product Registration is valid and in
full force and effect and each of Abbott and each of its Affiliates is in
material compliance with the terms and conditions of the Product
Registrations. Neither Abbott nor any Affiliate of Abbott has received at any
time since January 1, 2011, any written notice from any Governmental Authority
containing any actual or threatened revocation, withdrawal, suspension,
cancellation or termination of any Product Registration, except for matters
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Abbott and its
Affiliates, with respect to the Products, are not subject to, nor does Abbott
have Knowledge of facts or circumstances reasonably likely to cause any
material obligation arising under an administrative or regulatory action,
warning letter, notice of violation letter or other notice from any Regulatory
Authority, except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had

statements and schedules thereto and all information incorporated therein by
reference, the " _Mylan SEC Documents_ "). As of its filing date or, if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Mylan SEC Document
(other than any registration statement filed pursuant to the requirements of
the Securities Act) complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to
such Mylan SEC Document and did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of its effective date or, if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment, each Mylan SEC Document that is a registration statement
filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to such Mylan SEC Document and did
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or

 



      
 

 



 

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. None of the Mylan
Subsidiaries is required to make any filings with the SEC.

 



 

(b) Mylan has timely responded to all comment letters of the staff of the SEC
relating to the Mylan SEC Documents, and the SEC has not asserted that any of
such responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. None
of the Mylan SEC Documents is, to the Knowledge of Mylan, the subject of
ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Mylan qualifies as a "well-known
seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (a " _WKSI_

405 under the Securities Act.

 



 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, Mylan is not a party to or otherwise
bound by any Contract granting any Person the right to require Mylan to
register for sale pursuant to the Securities Act any Securities of Mylan that

Agreement, there is no Order outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of
Mylan, allegation, inquiry or investigation by any Governmental Authority
involving any Mylan Party or any Mylan Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonable be expected to have a Mylan Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.10 _Compliance with Laws_.

 



 

(a) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Mylan Material Adverse Effect,
Mylan and each of the Mylan Subsidiaries are and, since January 1, 2011, have
been, in compliance with all applicable Laws. Since January 1, 2011, neither
Mylan nor any of the Mylan Subsidiaries has received any written notice from
any Governmental Authority regarding (i) any noncompliance with any Law or

reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

assurance (i) that transactions are made in accordance with managements
authorization, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of Mylans consolidated financial statements in conformity with

that information required to be disclosed by Mylan in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Mylans
principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Mylan required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

5.11 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) All material Tax Returns required by applicable Laws to have been filed
with any Governmental Authority by, or on behalf of Mylan and the Mylan

accordance with all applicable Laws and all Taxes of Mylan and the Mylan
Subsidiaries have been paid when due.

required by Law to withhold or collect have been timely and duly withheld or

Taxes upon any property or assets of Mylan or any of the Mylan Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) There are no material (i) Tax examinations, disputes or Actions of which
Mylan or any Mylan Subsidiaries have been notified or, to the Knowledge of
Mylan, are threatened, (ii) written claims for Taxes asserted, or (iii)
unresolved claims in competent authority pursuant to any income Tax, trade Tax
or social insurance Tax treaty, that, in each case, may result in Taxes of
Mylan or the Mylan Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(e) No Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction in which Mylan or a Mylan
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns has ever claimed in writing that Mylan or
such Mylan Subsidiary may owe Taxes to such jurisdiction or is required to
file a Tax Return in such jurisdiction.

 



 

5.12 _Brokers_. Mylan shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses of
any broker, finder or investment banker entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by

Mylan Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

5.13 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. On October 21, 2014, the Board of
Directors of Mylan received the written opinion of Centerview Partners LLC,

Sellers for the French Business IP Assets and the Acquired Shares pursuant to
the Original Transaction Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to

Agreements, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no Contract in effect

Business after the Closing and pending the Delayed Reorganization Closing in
any Delayed Reorganization Jurisdictions other than for gross negligence or

negotiations with works councils, unions, labor boards, employee groups and
Governmental Authorities, or at such time as the Parties may mutually agree
upon in writing. For purposes of _Sections 4.2(b)_ , _4.3(b)_ , _5.4(b)_ ,
_6.1_ , _7.7_ , _7.10_ , _7.15_ , _7.16_ and _7.17(b)_ and _Article 8_ (as
described in _Section 6.7(b)_) to the extent applicable in connection with
any Delayed Reorganization Jurisdiction, all references to the Closing or the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be references to the applicable Delayed
Reorganization Closing.

 



 

(b) For purposes of _Article 8_, in respect of any Delayed Reorganization
Jurisdiction, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, (i) subject
to clause (iv) below, New Mylan and Abbott shall mutually agree in good faith
on appropriate arrangements to continue the Abbott compensation and employee
benefits (including statutory arrangements) for the applicable Business
Employees as of the Closing (except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law), at the expense of New Mylan, and such Business Employees
shall remain employees of Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates until the date
of the Delayed Reorganization Closing or such other date as may be agreed upon
by New Mylan and Abbott, (ii) except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law, Business Employees in such Delayed Reorganization Jurisdiction

cause the transfer of any Pension Transfer Amount and any DC Transfer Amount
to take place within 180 days of the Delayed Reorganization Closing, in each
case after taking into account adjustments for earnings, gains/losses and
benefit payments after the Delayed Reorganization Closing but prior to the
date of transfer, in the same manner as provided in _Sections 8.4_ and _8.5_ ,
respectively, and (iv) any required adjustments to implement _Article 8_ with
respect to such Delayed Reorganization Jurisdiction, including in respect of
the timing and manner of payments between Abbott, Affiliates of Abbott, New
Mylan or Affiliates of New Mylan, shall be set forth in the Reorganization
Transfer Documents applicable to the Delayed Reorganization Jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, notwithstanding that there may be
Delayed Reorganization Jurisdictions, the Parties nevertheless agree to treat
New Mylan or the applicable Affiliate of New Mylan as having acquired
beneficial interest in and to all Transferred Business Assets and Assumed
Business Liabilities at the Closing. Accordingly, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, (i) Abbott and its Affiliates shall be treated as conducting the
Business in the Delayed Reorganization Jurisdiction for the benefit and as an
agent of New Mylan or its applicable Affiliate and (ii) all cash and cash
equivalents generated by the Transferred Business Assets in any Delayed
Reorganization Jurisdiction will be for the account of New Mylan or its
applicable Affiliate.

 



 

(d) If the Delayed Reorganization Closing for any Delayed Reorganization
Jurisdiction has not occurred by the third anniversary of the Closing Date,
then Abbott and the Continuing Affiliates shall, acting as agents of New Mylan
and its applicable Affiliates, take all reasonable actions necessary to sell
the Transferred Business Assets related to such Delayed Reorganization
Jurisdiction for the benefit and at the expense of New Mylan or its applicable
Affiliates and in accordance with New Mylans reasonable instructions;
_provided_ that (i) New Mylan shall indemnify Abbott and the Continuing

not be required to take any action materially adverse to the business
interests of Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates.

Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Abbott shall provide Mylan a schedule
setting forth for each Acquired Company and each Acquired Company Subsidiary
as of the Closing the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of such
Person and the number of shares of capital stock of such Person that will be
issued and outstanding and the record ownership and Beneficial Ownership
thereof (the " _Reorganization Capitalization Table_ ").

representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
their respective staffs, on the other hand, in each case, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Mylan shall take
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments or objections,
if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any Competition/Investment Law so as to enable the
Parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, disposition or license of any assets, properties, businesses,
rights or product lines of New Mylan, Mylan, its Subsidiaries or the Business,
or any interests therein, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Mylans, New Mylans or their
respective Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its or their
ability to retain, one or more of the assets, properties, businesses, rights
or product lines of New Mylan, Mylan, its Subsidiaries or the Business, in
each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any decree, Order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Mylan shall not be required to propose, negotiate, commit to,
effect or take any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Business Transfer. Mylan shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend
through appropriate Action any claim asserted in court by any Person in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree or preliminary
injunction that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require Mylan
to defend through Action any claim asserted in court by any Party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any permanent injunction or
administrative litigation that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Abbott and its Affiliates
shall not, without Mylans prior written consent, propose, negotiate, commit
to, effect or take any action in respect of any impediment or objection that
may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Competition/Investment Law.

 



      
 

 



 

7.9 _Notifications_. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware that shall result in (a) any
representation or warranty made by such Party to be untrue or inaccurate in a
manner which would result in the failure of the condition set forth in
_Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_ and (b) any material failure on such
Partys part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice (including not having any effect for purposes of
determining (i) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article 10_
or (ii) whether any Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article
12_).

into arrangements effective as of the Closing whereby New Mylan or its
Affiliates would be substituted for Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates in
any guarantees, letters of comfort, indemnities or arrangements entered into
by Abbott or its Continuing Affiliates in respect of the Business (but only to
the extent such guarantees, letters of comfort, indemnities or similar
arrangements constitute Assumed Business Liabilities). If New Mylan or its
Affiliates cannot enter into the arrangements referred to above, Abbott shall
not terminate any such guarantee, letter of comfort, indemnity or arrangement
without New Mylans prior written consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that New
Mylan shall enter into a separate guaranty with Abbott or its applicable
Continuing Affiliate to guarantee the performance of the obligations of Abbott
or such Continuing Affiliate, as applicable, under the Contract underlying
such guarantee, letter of comfort, indemnity or arrangement to the extent such
obligations constitute Assumed Business Liabilities.

other Party, shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use,
reasonable best efforts to obtain any Consent, substitution or amendment
required to novate or assign all Assumed Business Liabilities to New Mylan or
its Affiliates and any Excluded Liabilities to Abbott or the Continuing
Affiliates, and obtain in writing the unconditional release of Abbott and its
Affiliates with respect to the Assumed Business Liabilities and the
unconditional release of New Mylan and its Affiliates with respect to the
Excluded Liabilities, the costs of which shall be borne equally by Abbott and
New Mylan.

right and license to use the Abbott Brands in the Territories on signs,
billboards and telephone listings used in the Business immediately prior to
the Closing; _provided_ that New Mylan shall promptly cover and commence and
continue until completed the removal of such signs and billboards.

Business.

 



 

(e) Any use by New Mylan and its Affiliates of the Abbott Brands as permitted
in this _Section 7.11_ is subject to their use of the Abbott Brands in a form
and manner, and with standards of quality, substantially consistent with the
use of the Abbott Brands immediately prior to the Closing Date and delivered
to New Mylan in writing prior to the Closing. Except as expressly provided in
this _Section 7.11_, New Mylan and its Affiliates shall have no right to use
in any way the Abbott Brands.

 



 

7.12 _Corporate Name_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing,
but in any event no later than thirty (30) days thereafter, New Mylan shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, amend the Constituent Documents of the

Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to (i) hold such corporate or
other meetings as are necessary pursuant to applicable Laws to discharge the

Directors_ ") and (ii) execute and deliver to Abbott a general release and
discharge from each Acquired Company and Acquired Company Subsidiary releasing
and

 



      
 

 



 

discharging each Resigning Director and past director and each past and
present officer, employee and agent from any and all Liabilities to such
Acquired Company or Acquired Company in connection with or arising out of any
act or omission of any such director, officer, employee or agent, in his or
her capacity as such, at or prior to the Closing, in the case of (i) and (ii),
with effect as of the Closing.

 



 

(b) Effective upon the Closing, New Mylan shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company or Acquired
Company Subsidiary) to, make any claim against any past or present director,
officer, employee or agent of the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries (or their respective heirs or successors) in connection with any
act or omission of such director, officer, employee or agent in his or her
capacity as such prior to the Closing, except for fraud or as expressly

Agreed Form, to be entered into at the Closing between Abbott and New Mylan
(the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ") containing the terms and conditions
set forth on _Exhibit C_.

 



 

7.15 _Further Action_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any other express obligation hereunder, each of Abbott
and Mylan shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law, the Contracts included in the Transferred
Business Assets or otherwise and to execute and deliver such documents and
other papers and any other agreements, as may be necessary to, as soon as
practicable, carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Reorganization, the Business Transfer and the Merger, including obtaining from
third parties all required Consents, the costs of which shall be borne equally
by Abbott and New Mylan; _provided_ that, without Mylans prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Abbott shall not grant to any third party any concession that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect New Mylans
operation of the Business after the Closing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of Abbott and Mylan shall use its reasonable best
efforts to negotiate in good faith (to the extent not already in Agreed Form)
and enter into the Ancillary Agreements with such terms and conditions
required pursuant hereto and such other terms and conditions as are mutually
agreeable to the Parties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Abbott shall use its reasonable best efforts to transfer or have reissued to,
or obtain for, Acquired Companies all Permits necessary under Law to operate
the Business and the Transferred Business Assets.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense or otherwise
provide rights with respect to any Transferred Business Asset (including any
Contract (other than any

 



      
 

 



 

Employee Plan) included in the Transferred Business Assets) or any right
thereunder if an attempted assignment, license or other provision, without the
Consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of
a Contract with such third party or would in any way adversely affect the
rights of New Mylan or any of its Affiliates relating to such Transferred
Business Asset. If any such Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, the
Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain such Consent as promptly thereafter as practicable and the costs of
obtaining any such Consent shall be borne equally by Abbott and New Mylan;
_provided_ that, without Mylans prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Abbott shall not grant to any
third party any concession that would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect New Mylans operation of the Business after the Closing. If
the Parties are unable to obtain any required Consent prior to the Closing,
Abbott shall, after the Closing, solely to the extent any affected asset,
Contract or right inures to the benefit or burden of the Business, use
reasonable best efforts to (i) continue to be bound thereby pending assignment
to New Mylan, (ii) at the direction and expense of New Mylan, pay, perform and
discharge fully all of its obligations thereunder after the Closing and prior
to assignment to New Mylan, (iii) without further consideration therefor, pay,
assign and remit to New Mylan promptly all monies, rights and other
consideration received in respect of such asset, Contract or right and (iv)
exercise or exploit its rights and options under such asset, Contract or
right, when and as reasonably directed by New Mylan. If and when any such
Consent shall be obtained or such asset, Contract or right shall otherwise
become assignable, licensable, sublicenseable or able to be provided to New
Mylan, Abbott shall promptly assign, license, sublicense or otherwise provide
such asset, Contract or right to New Mylan without payment of further
consideration and New Mylan shall, without the payment of any further
consideration therefor, assume such asset, Contract or right.

 



 

(c) If the Parties determine that certain Transferred Business Assets were not
transferred to or retained in the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries at or prior to Closing or otherwise were not transferred to New
Mylan or one of its Affiliates at Closing, Abbott shall promptly transfer and
deliver any and all of such Transferred Business Assets to New Mylan or one of
its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Acquired Companies
and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries) without the payment by New Mylan of any
further consideration therefor. If the Parties determine that certain Excluded
Assets were transferred to or retained in the Acquired Companies or the
Acquired Company Subsidiaries at or prior to Closing or otherwise transferred
to New Mylan or one of its Affiliates at Closing, New Mylan shall promptly
transfer and deliver any and all of such Excluded Assets to Abbott or one of
the Continuing Affiliates without the payment by Abbott of any further
consideration therefor. The costs of obtaining any Consents in connection with
such transfer and delivery shall be borne equally by Abbott and New Mylan;
_provided_ that, without Mylans prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Abbott shall not grant to any
third party any concession that would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect New Mylans operation of the Business after the Closing. The
Parties agree and acknowledge that Business Know-How may not be contained in
Books, Records and Files, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other
than _Section 7.25_ to the contrary, but subject to the terms and conditions
of the Transition Services Agreement, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any obligation to deliver or effect any transfer of Business Know-
How to another Party beyond its obligations under this Agreement to deliver
Books, Records and Files.

 



       
 

 



 

7.16 _Mixed Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the Parties in writing, any Contract
(other than any Manufacturing Contract, Site Contract, Business IP License
Agreement, Employee Plan or any Contract that constitutes an Excluded Asset)
to which Abbott or any of its Affiliates is a Party prior to the Closing, in
each case that inures to the benefit or burden of each of the Business and the
Other Abbott Businesses (a " _Mixed Contract_ "), shall, to the extent
commercially reasonable, be separated (or, with respect to a Mixed-Use IP
License Agreement, to the extent not separated and to the extent permitted,
sublicensed in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.16(b)_) as of the
Closing, so that each of Abbott and New Mylan shall be entitled to the rights
and benefits and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities inuring
to their respective businesses. Abbott shall provide New Mylan with a copy of
each Mixed Contract (it being understood that the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to comply, where practicable, with any applicable confidentiality
provisions contained in such Mixed Contracts), and the Parties shall cooperate
with each other to effect such separation. The costs of such separation shall
be borne equally by Abbott and New Mylan; _provided_ that, without Mylans
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Abbott shall not grant to any third party any
concession that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect New Mylans operation of the Business after the Closing. If any Mixed
Contract cannot be so separated (or, with respect to a Mixed-Use IP License
Agreement, to the extent not separated and to the extent permitted,
sublicensed in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.16(b)_), Abbott
and New Mylan shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to,
use their reasonable best efforts to cause, for the period after the Closing,
(i) the rights and benefits under each Mixed Contract to the extent relating
to the Business to be enjoyed by New Mylan; (ii) the Liabilities under each
Mixed Contract to the extent relating to the Business to be borne by New
Mylan; (iii) the rights and benefits under each Mixed Contract to the extent
relating to the Other Abbott Businesses to be enjoyed by Abbott; and (iv) the
Liabilities under each Mixed Contract to the extent relating to the Other
Abbott Businesses to be borne by Abbott. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Mixed Contract, Abbott may, in its sole discretion, elect in
lieu of the foregoing arrangements to assign its entire interest in any Mixed
Contract to New Mylan subject to the provisions of _Section 7.15_ and the
other terms hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Abbott shall remain
primarily liable for, and shall indemnify New Mylan and its Affiliates in
respect of, any Liabilities thereunder to the extent such Liabilities relate
to the Abbott Other Businesses.

 



 

(b) If any Mixed-Use IP License Agreement is not separated in accordance with
_Section 7.16(a)_, effective as of the Closing, Abbott and the Continuing
Affiliates hereby grant (to the extent Abbott or any of the Continuing
Affiliates has a right to, and subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Mixed-Use IP License Agreements) to the Acquired Companies and the
Acquired Company Subsidiaries, a perpetual, irrevocable (except in the event
of a material breach by New Mylan or its Affiliates of this _Section
7.16(b)_, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice
from Abbott), non-exclusive right and sublicense under the Mixed-Use IP
License Agreements and solely for purposes of developing, manufacturing,
using, selling, offering to sell, distributing, importing, supporting and
otherwise disposing of the Products in or for the Territories and, in each
case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Joint Products Agreement (the
" _Licensed Mixed-Use IP Sublicenses_ "). The Licensed Mixed-Use IP
Sublicenses shall be non-assignable (provided that

 



      
 

 



 

each such Licensed Mixed-Use IP Sublicense shall, to the extent permitted by
and consistent with the terms of the applicable underlying Mixed-Use IP
License Agreement, be assignable, without the consent of Abbott, by an
Acquired Company or Acquired Company Subsidiary, as applicable, (i) to New
Mylan or any Affiliate of New Mylan if (A) such Affiliate agrees in writing to
be bound by the terms of such Licensed Mixed-Use IP Sublicense, (B) such
assignee continues to be an Affiliate of New Mylan and (C) the assigning
Acquired Company or Acquired Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall remain
primarily liable for the performance of all obligations of such Person under
such Licensed Mixed-Use IP Sublicense and (ii) to any Person in connection
with the sale by New Mylan or its Affiliates, as applicable, to such Person of
(A) the Business, whether by merger, consolidation, combination,
reorganization or similar transaction or the transfer, sale, lease, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Business or
(B) the Product or Products to which such Licensed Mixed-Use IP Sublicense
relates). To the extent the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries exploitation after the Closing of Intellectual Property
sublicensed to under this _Section 7.16(b)_ results in or otherwise
contributes to an obligation by Abbott or the Continuing Affiliates (as
sublicensor under this _Section 7.16(b)_) to make any payments to a third
Person, the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for such payment obligations.

 



 

7.17 _Intercompany Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Closing, Abbott shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (i) terminate all agreements or arrangements, written or
unwritten, of any kind (other than any Ancillary Agreements), between Abbott
or any Continuing Affiliate, on the one hand, and an Acquired Company or any
Acquired Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, and (ii) settle or otherwise
extinguish any amounts (other than any amounts under any Ancillary Agreements)
owed to or by Abbott or any Continuing Affiliate, on the one hand, and an
Acquired Company or any Acquired Company Subsidiary, on the other hand.

 



 

(b) If, following the Reorganization and prior to the Closing, an amount of
cash and cash equivalents has not been distributed or otherwise transferred
from any Acquired Company or Acquired Company Subsidiary to Abbott or a
Continuing Affiliate, Abbott may permit such Acquired Company or Acquired
Company Subsidiary to hold, on behalf of and as an agent for Abbott, such cash
and cash equivalents (the " _Acquired Company Cash Amount_ "), which Acquired
Company Cash Amount the Parties acknowledge and agree is (and agree to account
for as) an Excluded Asset. New Mylan shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, pay to Abbott or a Continuing Affiliate promptly after the
Closing an amount equal to the Acquired Company Cash Amount.

 



 

7.18 _Books, Records and Files_.

 



 

(a) Abbott or its Affiliates may redact from any Books, Records and Files
transferred and delivered to New Mylan, an Acquired Company or an Acquired
Company Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Agreement any information
that is not related to the Business or any Transferred Business Asset or
Assumed Business Liability.

 



 

(b) New Mylan agrees to retain and maintain all Books, Records and Files that
are included in the Transferred Business Assets and that are delivered to New
Mylan

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder for a period of at least seven (7) years after Closing (plus any
additional time during which New Mylan has been advised by Abbott that (a)
there is an ongoing Action with respect to Taxes with respect to periods prior
to the Closing or (b) any such period is otherwise open to assessment;
_provided_ that only such Books, Records and Files reasonably related to the
appropriate Action with respect to Taxes or period as advised by Abbott shall
be subject to such time extension). During such period, New Mylan agrees to
provide Abbott and its representatives reasonable cooperation, access
(including copies) and staff assistance, as needed, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, with respect to the Books, Records and Files
delivered to New Mylan hereunder, and Abbott agrees to provide New Mylan and
its representatives reasonable cooperation, access (including copies) and
staff assistance, as needed, during normal business hours and upon reasonable

purposes, including the defense of litigation, the preparation of Tax Returns
and financial statements, the auditing of financial statements, other
financial reporting activities and the management and handling of Actions with
respect to Taxes; _provided_ that such cooperation, access and assistance does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of New Mylan or Abbott or their
respective Affiliates.

 



 

(c) New Mylan and Abbott agree that Abbott may maintain copies of any Books,
Records and Files that are included in the Transferred Business Assets and
that are delivered to New Mylan hereunder.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, New Mylan and its Affiliates shall also
cooperate with and provide Abbott, the Continuing Affiliates and their
respective representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, access to information prepared or generated after the Closing related
to the operation of the Business prior to the Closing, as may reasonably be
requested by Abbott to prepare financial statements for the Business for the
periods ending prior to or on the Closing; _provided_ that such access does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of New Mylan or its Affiliates.

 



 

7.19 _Audited Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.19(b)_, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement, Abbott shall deliver to Mylan such financial

engage in the business of marketing, promoting, selling or offering for sale
any pharmaceutical product in the Territories that contains the same active
pharmaceutical ingredient, whether alone or in combination with any other
active pharmaceutical ingredient, in any formulation, form or dosage strength,
as an active pharmaceutical ingredient incorporated in any Product, in each
instance including influenza vaccines, other than (i) in the ophthalmic or
veterinary field of use and (ii) any products that incorporate such active

the Closing Date and expiring on the second (2nd) anniversary thereof:
_provided_ that, this _Section 7.21(a)_ shall not prohibit Abbott or any

result of a combination of shares, recapitalization, consolidation or other
reorganization of such Person, Abbott shall not be in breach of this _Section

the divestiture of an amount of the Securities of such Person necessary for
Abbott or the applicable Continuing Affiliate to Beneficially Own fifteen
percent (15%) or less of the applicable class of outstanding Securities of

preceding the year in which the acquisition of the Acquired Business is
completed), but not more than $200,000,000 of the aggregate revenues of the
Acquired Business in such calendar year (measured using the Exchange Rate as
of the last U.S. Business Day of such calendar year) and (B) $50,000,000 of

shall, within twelve (12) months following the date of on which such Acquired
Business was acquired, enter into a definitive agreement for the divestiture
of such Acquired Competing Business. If the divestiture of an Acquired
Competing Business is required pursuant to this _Section 7.21(a)(v)_, Abbott
shall provide notice to New Mylan, and Abbott shall not, and shall not permit
or cause any of its Continuing Affiliates to, enter into any definitive

_Schedule 8.1(a)(i)-1_ and (ii) list of all Business Employees, which Schedule
and list shall be prepared and may be updated in accordance with this
Agreement from time to time prior to, and shall be finalized at, Closing (in
the case of _Schedule 8.1(a)(i)-1_ by mutual agreement of the Parties).

 



 

(ii) " _Former Business Employee_ " means any individual whose employment with
the Business terminated prior to the Closing (including any Business Employee
who has received notice of termination prior to the date of this Agreement)
for whom

 



      
 

 



 

no obligation to recall, rehire or otherwise return to employment with Abbott
or its Affiliates exists under Contract and who primarily performed his or her
services for or with respect to the Business (or for or with respect to any
previously acquired business that is considered part of the Business)
immediately prior to such individuals termination of employment.

 



 

(iii) " _Transferred Employee_ " means each Business Employee who is employed
by New Mylan, Mylan, an Acquired Company or an Acquired Company Subsidiary
immediately following the Closing.

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Employment_.

 



 

(i) Prior to or at the Closing, Abbott shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
as applicable, to take such steps as are required to (A) transfer the
employment of each Business Employee to an Acquired Company or an Acquired
Company Subsidiary, other than (x) any Business Employee employed in the U.S.
or (y) any Business Employee who is a U.S. expatriate, either, as applicable,

8.2 _Compensation and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits Comparability_. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing, or such longer period as required by applicable Law,
Transferred Employees who remain in the employment of New Mylan or any of its
Affiliates shall receive (i) base salary or wage rates that are not less than
those in effect for each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to
Closing, (ii) equity and cash incentive compensation opportunities that, in
the aggregate, are no less favorable than those in effect for each such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to Closing, (iii) employee benefits
that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to those in effect for each
such Transferred Employee immediately prior to Closing (including defined
benefit pension benefits), and (iv) severance benefits that are no less
favorable on an individual basis than the greater of (A) the severance
benefits that would have been applicable to each such Transferred Employee
under the Abbott or applicable Abbott Affiliate severance plans or individual
Contracts to the extent set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)_ (which Abbott shall
provide Mylan no later than sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement
and _Schedule 8.2(a)_ shall exclude any plan or Contract mandated by and
maintained solely pursuant to applicable Law), immediately prior to the
Closing, as the case may be, taking into account such Transferred Employees
additional period of service and rate of base salary or wages and bonus target
with New Mylan or its Affiliates following the Closing and (B) the severance
benefits applicable to similarly situated employees of New Mylan or its
Affiliates. Except as required by Law, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed as requiring New Mylan or one of its Affiliates to continue
the employment of any specific Person or to continue any specific benefit
plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Severance Liabilities_. New Mylan and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for any severance, redundancy or similar termination payments or
benefits that may become payable to any Business Employee arising out of or in
connection with the Reorganization or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any transfers described in _Section 6.7(b)_ or _Section
8.1(b)_) and any amounts paid or payable to any Business Employee who does not
become a Transferred Employee because such Business Employee rejects a
transfer of employment or refuses to transfer employment or does not accept an
offer to transfer employment or otherwise challenges such transfer of
employment pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_. To the extent
that Abbott or any of its Continuing Affiliates becomes liable for, or is
legally required to make, severance, redundancy or similar termination
payments or benefits to any Business Employee as a result of the
Reorganization or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, New Mylan
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse Abbott, as soon as
practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt from Abbott of
appropriate verification, for all payments, costs and expenses actually paid
by Abbott or any Affiliate as required by applicable Law or any Contract or
Employee Plan.

 



 

(c) _Service Credit_. New Mylan shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
recognize the prior service and seniority (including prior service and
seniority with any previously acquired business that is considered part of the
Business) of each Transferred Employee as if such service had been performed
with, and such seniority has been earned with, New Mylan for all purposes
under the employee benefit plans and policies provided by New Mylan to the
Transferred Employees following the Closing (other than benefit accruals under
New Mylans defined benefit pension plans except to the extent required by
applicable Law or as provided in this _Article 8_), to the same extent such
service and seniority is recognized by Abbott or its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing, except if such service and seniority would result in the
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) _Welfare Plans_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, (i)
Abbott or one of its Continuing Affiliates shall retain responsibility under
the Abbott "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA, whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) in which the Transferred
Employees participate with respect to all welfare benefit claims incurred by
the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the Closing
and all welfare benefit claims incurred by Former Business Employees and their
eligible dependents (other than claims under Stand-Alone Employee Plans)
whether prior to or following the Closing and (ii) New Mylan or one of its
Affiliates shall be responsible for all welfare benefit claims incurred by
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents on or after the Closing
and for all welfare benefit claims incurred by Former Business Employees and
their eligible dependents under Stand-Alone Employee Plans. With respect to
any "employee welfare benefit plan" maintained by New Mylan or any of its
Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate after
the Closing, or any Stand-Alone Employee Plan in which Former Business
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, New Mylan shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to (A) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Transferred
Employees (or with respect to Stand-Alone Employee Plans, applicable to such
Former Business Employees) to the extent such conditions and exclusions were
satisfied by such individual or did not apply under the welfare benefit plans
maintained by Abbott or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
and (B) provide each Transferred Employee (or with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to Stand-Alone Employee Plans, such Former Business Employee) with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such individual in the plan
year in which the Closing occurs prior to the Closing in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.

 



 

(e) _Labor and Employment Law Matters_. No later than seven (7) days prior to
any consultation with a works council, union, labor board, employee group or
Governmental Authority regarding the effect, impact or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Abbott will discuss with Mylan
the approach and details to be discussed as part of such consultation and will
include reasonable comments from Mylan that have been provided not later than
three (3) days prior to such consultation. Mylan and Abbott shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, cooperate to take all steps, on a timely basis, as
are required under applicable Law to notify, consult with or negotiate the
effect, impact or timing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with each works council, union, labor board, employee group or Governmental
Authority where so required under applicable Law. Abbott shall regularly
review with Mylan the progress of the notifications, consultations and
negotiations with each works council, union, labor board, employee group and
Governmental Authority regarding the effect, impact or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Mylan and Abbott shall, and shall
cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with all applicable Laws,
directives and regulations relating to the Business Employees. New Mylan or
its applicable Affiliate shall become a party to any collective bargaining
(including national, sector or local), works council or similar agreement with
respect to any Transferred Employee and shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, be responsible for all Liabilities related to periods after the Closing
arising under any collective bargaining (including any national, sector or
local), works council or similar agreement with respect to any Transferred
Employee. New Mylan shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, join any
industrial, employer or similar association or federation if membership is
required for the currently applicable collective bargaining, works council or
similar agreement to continue to apply.

 



 

(f) _Incentive Compensation_. New Mylan shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, continue each performance period in effect at the Closing under each
incentive compensation bonus plan in which any Transferred Employee
participates and which is listed on _Schedule 8.2(f)_ (which Abbott shall
provide New Mylan no later than thirty (30) days after the date of this
Agreement), with appropriate adjustment (as determined by New Mylan in good
faith) to the applicable performance targets to take into account the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. New Mylan shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, make such bonus payments at the time prescribed by the
applicable plan as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and in
accordance with the historical past practices under such plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. New Mylan or its applicable Affiliate shall
pay bonuses in accordance with the financial plan of Abbott and its Affiliates
in effect as of the Closing.

 



 

8.3 _Liabilities_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Article 8_ or in
_Section 6.5_ or _6.7(b)_ , effective as of the Closing, Abbott and its
Continuing Affiliates shall retain Liability and responsibility for all
employment, labor, compensation, pension, employee welfare and employee
benefits-related Liabilities, other than such Liabilities under Stand-Alone
Employee Plans, (a) that relate to the Former Business Employees (or any
dependent or beneficiary of any Former Business Employee) and any director,
officer, employee, consultant or other service

 



       
 

 



 

provider of Abbott and its Affiliates who is not a Transferred Employee, (b)
incurred, or arising out of or relating to a period ending, on or prior to the
Closing that relate to the Business Employees (or any dependent or beneficiary
of any Business Employee), (c) relating to any claim that a Business Employee
should have been a Transferred Employee or that any Transferred Employee
should not have been treated as such or (d) under any Employee Plans that are
not Stand-Alone Employee Plans (including equity compensation plans). Except
as otherwise provided in this _Article 8_ or in _Section 6.6_ or _6.7(b)_ ,
effective as of the Closing, (i) New Mylan and its Affiliates shall assume and
be solely responsible for all employment, labor, compensation, pension,
employee welfare and employee benefits-related Liabilities (A) that are
payable after the Closing, which Liabilities are incurred or arise out of or
relate to a period beginning after the Closing, and that relate to any
Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred
Employee) or (B) under any Stand-Alone Employee Plans and (ii) Abbott and its
Continuing Affiliates shall have no liability with respect to any Transferred
Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that
relates to such Transferred Employees employment with New Mylan or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing

 



 

8.4 _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, New Mylan shall, with respect to any
Transferred Employee (i) whose defined benefit pension obligation in one or
more of the defined benefit pension plans maintained by Abbott or its
Continuing Affiliates is required to be assumed or retained by an Acquired
Company or an Acquired Company Subsidiary under applicable Law as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) who participates in
one or more of the defined benefit pension plans maintained by Abbott or its
Continuing Affiliates in any Territory set forth on _Schedule 8.4(a)_
(collectively, the " _Abbott Transferor Pension Plans_ "), establish or
designate defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the " _New Mylan
Transferee Pension Plans_ ") for the benefit of such Transferred Employees.
The Transferred Employees (A) whose defined benefit pension obligation is
required to be assumed or retained by an Acquired Company or an Acquired
Company Subsidiary or (B) who participate in one or more of the defined
benefit pension plans maintained by Abbott or its Continuing Affiliates in any
Territory set forth on _Schedule 8.4(a)_ are referred to hereinafter as the "
_Abbott Transferred Pension Plan Employees_." The Abbott Transferred Pension
Plan Employees shall be given credit under the respective New Mylan Transferee
Pension Plan for all service with and compensation from Abbott or its
Affiliates as if it were service with and compensation from New Mylan for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or
benefit accruals under each respective New Mylan Transferee Pension Plan. Each
New Mylan Transferee Pension Plan shall provide, upon the transfer of assets
referred to below (or, if there is no transfer of assets with respect to a
particular plan because the plan is not funded, as of the Closing), that the
accrued benefits for the Abbott Transferred Pension Plan Employees under such
New Mylan Transferee Pension Plan shall in no event be less than their accrued
benefits under the corresponding Abbott Transferor Pension Plan as of the
Closing.

 



 

(b) (i) With respect to any Abbott Transferor Pension Plan that is funded
(other than any Abbott Transferor Pension Plan maintained in Germany), Abbott
shall cause to be transferred from the trusts (or in the case of other funding
vehicles, transferred from such funding vehicles) under such Abbott Transferor
Pension Plan to the trusts or other funding vehicles under the corresponding
New Mylan Transferee Pension Plan assets in the form of cash,

 



      
 

 



 

cash equivalents, marketable securities or insurance contracts (to the extent
allowable under the terms of such contracts and exclusively intended to cover
plan benefits), the value of which shall be equal to: (i) the actuarial
present value of projected (and not accrued) benefits (that is, the "projected
benefit obligation" as defined in Topic 715 in the FASBs Accounting Standards
Codification, " _PBO_ ") under such Abbott Transferor Pension Plan as of the
Closing Date that are attributable to the Abbott Transferred Pension Plan
Employees divided by the PBO of all participants in such Abbott Transferor
Pension Plan as of the Closing Date, multiplied by the market value of the
assets of such Abbott Transferor Pension Plan at the Closing Date, provided
that such transferred amount shall not, in any event, exceed the PBO under
such Abbott Transferor Pension Plan of all Abbott Transferred Pension Plan
Employees as of the date of Closing or (ii) such greater amount as is required
by applicable Law or the applicable Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over the Abbott Transferor Pension Plan in order to obtain approval for the
transfer.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any Abbott Transferor Pension Plan maintained in Germany
that has a corresponding Contractual Trust Arrangement (the " _Abbott
Contractual Trust Arrangement_ "), New Mylan shall cause a contractual trust
arrangement (the " _New Mylan Contractual Trust Arrangement_ ") to be
established in connection with the corresponding New Mylan Transferee Pension
Plan. Abbott shall cause to be transferred from the Abbott Contractual Trust
Arrangement under such Abbott Transferor Pension Plan to the New Mylan
Contractual Trust Arrangement under the corresponding New Mylan Transferee
Pension Plan assets in the form of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, the value of which shall be equal to: (A) the PBO under such
Abbott Transferor Pension Plan as of the Closing Date that is attributable to
the Abbott Transferred Pension Plan Employees divided by the PBO of all
participants in such Abbott Transferor Pension Plan as of the Closing Date,
multiplied by the market value of the assets of such Abbott Contractual Trust
Arrangement at the Closing Date, provided that such transferred amount shall
not, in any event, exceed the PBO under such Abbott Transferor Pension Plan of
all Abbott Transferred Pension Plan Employees as of the date of Closing or (B)
such greater amount as is required by applicable Law or the applicable
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Abbott Transferor Pension
Plan in order to obtain approval for the transfer. To the extent (x) the
Abbott Contractual Trust Arrangement maintained by Abbott Arzneimittel GmbH
(the " _Arzneimittel Trust_ ") and the Abbott Contractual Trust Arrangement
maintained by Abbott Laboratories GmbH (the " _GmbH Trust_ ") are anticipated
to be overfunded according to Section 8.3 of the respective trust agreement at
the Closing (a " _CTA Overfunding_ ") and (y) the assets of the Arzneimittel
Trust and the GmbH Trust are anticipated to be less than the PBO of all
participants in such Abbott Contractual Trust Arrangement at the Closing (a "
_CTA Underfunding_ "), Abbott shall use reasonable best efforts under the
regulations of Section 8.3 of the respective trust agreement of Arzneimittel
Trust and GmbH Trust to use the CTA Overfunding to eliminate any CTA
Underfunding and, if there is no CTA Underfunding or if any CTA Underfunding
has been eliminated, withdraw any CTA Overfunding from Arzneimittel Trust and
GmbH Trust prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) The amounts determined in accordance with _Section 8.4(b)_ are
collectively referred to as the " _Pension Transfer Amounts_ ". The transfer
of the Pension Transfer Amounts, and the assumption by New Mylan and its
Affiliates of Liabilities with respect to or relating to the Abbott
Transferred Pension Plan Employees under the applicable Abbott

 



      
 

 



 

Transferor Pension Plans, shall be subject to such Consents and other
requirements as may apply under applicable Law, including the consent of the
Abbott Transferred Pension Plan Employees to the extent required by applicable
Law. New Mylan shall cause the corresponding New Mylan Transferee Pension
Plans to accept the Pension Transfer Amounts. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.4(b)(ii_), to the extent an Abbott Transferor Pension Plan is not
required to be funded by applicable Law and is not voluntarily funded as of
the Closing, there shall be no transfer of assets by the Abbott Transferor
Pension Plan or by Abbott or its Continuing Affiliates. Actuarial
determinations shall be made in accordance with _Section 8.4(g)_ below.

 



 

(d) As of the Closing Date, Abbott shall cause the Transferred Employees to
cease further accrual of benefits under the pension plans sponsored by Abbott
and its Continuing Affiliates.

 



 

(e) The Pension Transfer Amount, if any, from each Abbott Transferor Pension
Plan shall be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit payments made
from the Abbott Transferor Pension Plan to the Abbott Transferred Pension Plan
Employees after the Closing but prior to the date of transfer and for any
earnings and losses on such amount during such period. The Pension Transfer
Amount, if any, shall be determined pursuant to _Section 8.4(g)_ below.

 



 

(f) At the times of the transfers of the Pension Transfer Amounts, New Mylan
and the New Mylan Transferee Pension Plans shall assume all Liabilities for
all accrued benefits, including all disability, part-time and other ancillary
benefits, under the corresponding Abbott Transferor Pension Plans in respect
of the Abbott Transferred Pension Plan Employees whose benefits are
transferred, and Abbott and the Continuing Affiliates and the corresponding
Abbott Transferor Pension Plans shall be relieved of all Liabilities to
provide benefits under the Abbott Transferor Pension Plans to the Abbott
Transferred Pension Plan Employees whose benefits are transferred. From and
after the date of such applicable transfer of the Pension Transfer Amounts (or
if there is no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because
the plan is not required to be funded under applicable Law, from and after the
Closing), New Mylan agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Abbott and its
Continuing Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees, and
agents from and against any and all costs, damages, losses, expenses, or other
Liabilities arising out of or related to the Abbott Transferred Pension Plan
Employees whose benefits under the Abbott Transferor Pension Plans are
transferred to the New Mylan Transferee Pension Plans, or the transfer of
benefits, assets and Liabilities pursuant to this _Section 8.4_, or the
cessation of participation in the Abbott Transferor Pension Plans in
connection therewith.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this _Section 8.4_, actuarial determinations shall be
based upon the actuarial assumptions and methodologies used in preparing the
most recent audited financial statements of Abbott as of the date of the
determination. The applicable plan sponsor of the Abbott Transferor Pension
Plans shall cause the plan actuary or administrator to provide a report of its
determination of such amount within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date and
any back-up information reasonably required by New Mylan to confirm the
accuracy of such determination. If New Mylan disputes the accuracy of the
calculation, New Mylan and Abbott shall cooperate to identify the basis for
such disagreement and act in good faith to resolve such dispute. To the extent
that a dispute is unresolved after a forty-five (45) day period following
identification of such dispute, the calculations shall be verified by an
independent third party

 



      
 

 



 

benefits consulting firm selected by the mutual agreement of Abbott and New
Mylan. The decision of such consulting firm shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Abbott and New Mylan. New Mylan and Abbott shall share equally
the costs of such consulting firm.

 



 

8.5 _Defined Contribution Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, New Mylan shall, with respect to any
Transferred Employee whose defined contribution obligation in one or more of
the defined contribution plans maintained by Abbott or its Continuing
Affiliates is required to be assumed or retained by an Acquired Company or an
Acquired Company Subsidiary under applicable Law as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Abbott
Transferor DC Plans_ "), establish or designate defined contribution plans
(collectively, the " _New Mylan Transferee DC Plans_ ") for the benefit of
such Transferred Employees. The Transferred Employees whose defined
contribution obligation in one or more of the defined contribution plans
maintained by Abbott or its Continuing Affiliates is required to be assumed or
retained by an Acquired Company or an Acquired Company Subsidiary are referred
to hereinafter as the " _Abbott Transferred DC Employees_ ". The Abbott
Transferred DC Employees shall be given credit under the respective New Mylan
Transferee DC Plan for all service with and compensation from Abbott or its
Affiliates as if it were service with and compensation from New Mylan for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or
benefit accruals under each respective New Mylan Transferee DC Plan.

 



 

(b) With respect to an Abbott Transferor DC Plan, Abbott shall cause the
transfer under each such Abbott Transferor DC Plan to the corresponding New
Mylan Transferee DC Plan of cash or cash equivalents equal to the actual
account balances of the Abbott Transferred DC Employees under each such Abbott
Transferor DC Plan or contracts, agreements or policies with or assets held by
an external provider as of the Closing or such greater amount as is required
by the applicable regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Abbott
Transferor DC Plan in order to obtain approval of such transfer (the " _DC
Transfer Amount_ "). The transfer of the DC Transfer Amounts shall be subject
to such consents, approvals and other legal requirements as may apply under
applicable Law. New Mylan shall cause the DC Transfer Amounts to be accepted
by such plans. To the extent an Abbott Transferor DC Plan is not required to
be funded by applicable Law and is not voluntarily funded as of the Closing,
there shall be no transfer of assets.

 



 

(c) The DC Transfer Amount to be transferred, if any, from the respective
Abbott DC Plan shall be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit
payments made from the respective Abbott Transferor DC Plan to the Abbott
Transferred DC Employees after the Closing but prior to the date of transfer
and for any earnings and losses on such amount during such period. The
transfer of the DC Transfer Amount, if any, shall take place within ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) At the times of the transfers of the DC Transfer Amounts (or if there is
no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because the plan is
not required to be funded under applicable Law and is not voluntarily funded
at the Closing), New Mylan and the New Mylan Transferee DC Plans shall assume
all Liabilities under the corresponding Abbott Transferor DC Plan in respect
of the Abbott Transferred DC Employees whose benefits are transferred, and
Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates and the corresponding Abbott Transferor

 



      
 

 



 

DC Plans shall be relieved of all Liabilities to provide benefits under the
Abbott Transferor DC Plans to the Abbott Transferred DC Employees whose
benefits are transferred. From and after the date of such applicable transfer
of the DC Transfer Amounts (or if there is no transfer of assets with respect
to a particular plan because the plan is not required to be funded under
applicable Law, as of the Closing), New Mylan agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Abbott and its Continuing Affiliates and its and their officers,
directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all costs, damages,
losses, expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of or related to the Abbott
Transferred DC Employees whose benefits under the Abbott Transferor DC Plans
are transferred to the New Mylan Transferee DC Plans, or the transfer of
benefits, assets and Liabilities pursuant to this _Section 8.5_, or the
cessation of participation in the Abbott Transferor DC Plans in connection
therewith.

 



 

8.6 _ESPP_. Effective as of the Closing, each Transferred Employee who
participates in an employee stock purchase plan maintained by Abbott or its
Continuing Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing, as applicable, (the "
_Abbott ESPPs_ ") shall cease participation in the applicable Abbott ESPPs
and, except as otherwise required by applicable Law or as otherwise determined
by Abbott, shall have his or her payroll deductions refunded by Abbott as soon
as administratively practicable in accordance with the terms of the Abbott
ESPPs.

 



 

8.7 _Equity Compensation_. Abbott shall pay each Transferred Employee who, as
of the Closing:

 



 

(a) holds an outstanding stock option to purchase one or more common shares of
Abbott, or an outstanding stock option issued to convert an Abbott stock
option in connection with the separation of Abbotts research-based
pharmaceutical business, (each, an " _Abbott Option_ ") which is not
exercisable as of the Closing and which is forfeited as a consequence of the
Transferred Employees termination of employment with Abbott pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash (net of applicable withholding
Taxes) determined by multiplying the excess of the fair market value of one
share of the underlying common stock immediately prior to the date such Abbott
Option is forfeited over the exercise price of such Abbott Option by the
number of shares of common stock subject to such Abbott Option;

 



 

(b) holds Abbott restricted stock, or restricted stock issued to convert a
share of Abbott restricted stock in connection with the separation of Abbotts
research-based pharmaceutical business, (each, a share of " _Abbott Restricted
Stock_ ") which is forfeited as a consequence of the Transferred Employees
termination of employment with Abbott pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
an amount in cash (net of applicable withholding Taxes) determined by
multiplying the fair market value of one share of the applicable common stock
as of the Closing, by the number of shares of the applicable Abbott Restricted
Stock; and

 



 

(c) holds a restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Abbott common
stock, or a restricted stock unit issued to convert an Abbott restricted stock
unit in connection with the separation of Abbotts research-based
pharmaceutical business, (each, an " _Abbott RSU_ ") which is forfeited as a
consequence of the Transferred Employees termination of employment with
Abbott pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash (net of
applicable withholding Taxes) determined by multiplying the fair market value
of one share of the applicable underlying common stock as of the Closing by
the number of shares of the applicable common stock subject to such Abbott
RSU.

 



      
 

 



 

New Mylan shall not be responsible for reimbursing Abbott for any payments
(including amounts withheld for Taxes) made under this _Section 8.7_.

 



 

8.8 _Business Employee Announcements; Questions and Answers; Access_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, prior to any written announcement being made to
the Business Employees by Mylan or its Affiliates with respect to the

(5) U.S. Business Days notice to Abbott for purposes of making announcements
concerning, and preparing for, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that such access or meetings do not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business.

 



 

8.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of _Section
13.5_, the provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to the Business
Employees shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each
of the Parties and shall not create any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever in any other Person, including any Business Employee (or dependent
or beneficiary of any Business Employee) or any employee representative body,
works council or trade union. Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of
any plan providing benefits to any Business Employee.

 



 

8.10 _European Council Directive_. To the extent applicable, the Parties
acknowledge the application of the European Council Directive of March 12,
2001 (2001/23/EC) (the " _Directive_ "), relating to the safeguarding of

any other similar Law. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that they
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with the

respect to items comprising such Tax Returns or filings determined under
Sections 367, 482, 964, and 902 of the Code or similar provisions of non-U.S.

or a "controlled foreign corporation" as defined under Section 957 of the
Code.

normal office hours, have reasonable access to those officers, employees,
agents, accountants, auditors, contractors and subcontractors of New Mylan or
any Affiliate who have or may have knowledge of matters with respect to which

or its Affiliates.

 



 

9.2 _Preparation of Returns_. Abbott and its Affiliates shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in
respect of any Affiliate of Abbott (including any Acquired Company and, if

to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return and in accordance with
Law. Abbott and its Affiliates shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental
Authority all Taxes due in connection with any such Tax Returns. New Mylan and
its Affiliates shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all other Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies or
Acquired Company Subsidiaries. With respect to a Tax Return for a Straddle
Period, New Mylan shall provide Abbott with a copy of such Tax Return at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return for Abbotts
review and comment. New Mylan shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments made by Abbott within fifteen (15) days of New Mylans delivery of
such copy. New Mylan shall, no later than five (5) U.S. Business Days before

thirty (30) U.S. Business Days after receiving the refund or applying the
credit against a Tax then due.

 



 

9.4 _Tax Agreements_. Except for agreements among or between Acquired
Companies and Acquired Company Subsidiaries, all Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Business shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, New Mylan
and its Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder
for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

9.5 _Unrestricted Action_. Except as specifically set forth herein or on
_Schedule 9.5_ , New Mylan shall be unrestricted with respect to all matters
concerning Taxes of New Mylan and its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries).

 



 

9.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to avail
itself of any available exemptions from any Transfer Taxes described in clause
(d) of the definition of "Excluded Taxes", and to cooperate with the other
Party in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to
obtain such exemptions.

 



 

9.7 _Allocation of Taxes Between Periods_. In the case of any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the day before the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "): (A) real, personal and intangible property taxes ("
_Property Taxes_ ") for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day
before the Closing Date shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days during the Straddle Period up to (but not
including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period; and (B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day before the Closing Date shall
be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the open of business on the
Closing Date, and in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership of
any equity interest in any partnership or other "flow-through" entity or
"controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the
Code or any comparable state, local or non-U.S. Law), as if the taxable period
of such partnership, other "flow-through" entity or "controlled foreign
corporation" ended as of the open of business on the Closing Date (whether or
not such Taxes arise in a Straddle Period of the applicable owner).

Statement when permitted to do so in accordance with this _Section 11.3_, it
shall be entitled to all other rights and remedies available under this
Agreement and applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if Abbott elects to deliver a Reimbursement Amount Statement to

of the date hereof or as of the Closing (or, in the case of any such
representation or warranty specifically made as of another date, as of such
other date), (b) any breach of any Abbott Fundamental Representation as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing (or, in the case of any such representation
or warranty specifically made as of another date, as of such other date), (c)
any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
complied with by Abbott or (d) any Excluded Liability. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of clauses (a) and
(b) of the immediately preceding sentence, each of (i) the determination of
whether any breach of any representation or warranty (other than the
representations and warranties in _Sections 4.5_ or _4.7(a)_ ) has occurred
and (ii) the determination of the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting
from any breach of any representation or warranty (other than the
representations and warranties in _Sections 4.5_ or _4.7(a)_ ) shall be made
without regard to any qualification or exception contained in such
representation or warranty relating to materiality or Business Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

12.2 _Indemnification by New Mylan_. From and after the Closing, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Agreement, New Mylan shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Abbott and the
Continuing Affiliates, the past, present and future directors, officers,
employees and agents of Abbott and the Continuing Affiliates, in their
respective capacities as such, and the heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and permitted assigns of the foregoing Persons (collectively the "
_Abbott Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses which any Abbott
Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the extent such Losses arise out of or
result from: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Mylan
Parties contained in this Agreement (other than the Mylan Fundamental
Representations) as of the date hereof or as of the Closing (or, in the case
of any such representation or warranty specifically made as of another date,
as of such other date), (b) any breach of any Mylan Fundamental Representation
as of the date hereof or as of the Closing (or, in the case of any such
representation or warranty specifically made as of another date, as of such
other date), (c) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement to be complied with by the Mylan Parties or (d) any Assumed Business
Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of the
immediately preceding sentence, each of (i) the determination of whether any
breach of any representation or warranty (other than the representations and
warranties in _Section 5.7(a)_) has occurred and (ii) the determination of
the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty (other than the representations and warranties in
_Section 5.7(a)_) shall be made without regard to any qualification or
exception contained in such representation or warranty relating to materiality
or Mylan Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

12.3 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) Any Mylan Indemnitee or Abbott Indemnitee seeking indemnification under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim asserted
against the Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in
respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under _Section 12.1_
or _Section 12.2_, as applicable, shall promptly deliver to the other Party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written notice (a " _Third Party Claim
Notice_ ") setting forth a description in reasonable detail of the nature of
the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third
Party Claim (if any), the basis for the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement and a reasonable estimate (if calculable)
of any Losses suffered with respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to so transmit a Third Party Claim Notice shall
not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article 12_,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

 



 

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is asserted against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and to settle such Third Party Claim at the discretion of
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not, except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into
any settlement or consent to entry of any judgment that (1) does not include
the provision by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties
of a full, unconditional and irrevocable release from all Liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim, (2) includes an admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party or (3)
includes injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting any Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
legal fees or expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense), _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party will pay
the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if, based on the reasonable
opinion of legal counsel to the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, a conflict or potential conflict of interest exists
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party which makes
representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct; _provided_ _further_ that the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(plus any appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection
with any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party may retain or take over the
control of the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of
which the Indemnifying Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party
irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under this _Article 12_ and fully
releases the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(iii) All of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and
each Party (or a duly authorized representative of such Party) shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) _Direct Claims_. If any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this _Article 12_ that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against such Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_
"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice (a " _Direct Claim Notice_ ") setting forth a description in
reasonable detail of the nature of the Direct Claim, the basis for the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement and a
reasonable estimate (if calculable) of any Losses suffered with respect to
such Direct Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so transmit a
Direct Claim Notice shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations
under this _Article 12_, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party
disputes a Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall attempt to resolve in good faith such dispute within forty-five (45)
days of the Indemnifying Party delivering written notice to the Indemnified
Party of such dispute. If such dispute is not so resolved within such forty-
five (45) day period, then either party may initiate an Action with respect to
the subject matter of such dispute in accordance with, and subject to the
limitations of, _Article 13_.

 



 

12.4 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the Abbott Fundamental
Representations and the Mylan Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, (b) the
Abbott Tax Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.6_ and _4.12(d)_ shall survive until the Closing, (c) all
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than the
Abbott Fundamental Representations, the Mylan Fundamental Representations, the
Abbott Tax Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.6_ and _4.12(d)_ ) shall survive the Closing until the date that
is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date and (d) except as otherwise
specified herein, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing indefinitely; _provided_ that each representation,
warranty, covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement shall survive the
time at which it would otherwise expire pursuant to this _Section 12.4_ if,
prior to such time, notice of a breach or potential breach thereof giving rise
to a right or potential right of indemnity under this _Article 12_ shall have
been given to the Party against whom such indemnity may be sought in
accordance with _Section 12.3_. Any claim not

 



      
 

 



 

asserted in accordance with this _Article 12_ on or prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 12.4_ will be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

 



 

12.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Article 12_: the Mylan Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to recover Losses pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)_ for any breach of
any representation or warranty attributable to a single course of conduct or
related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of Losses
incurred or suffered by the Mylan Indemnitees for such breach exceeds
$1,000,000;

 



 

(b) the Mylan Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_Section 12.1(a)_ until the aggregate amount which the Mylan Indemnitees
would recover under _Section 12.1(a)_ exceeds $50,000,000, in which case the
Mylan Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover such Losses in excess of
such amount, up to a maximum aggregate amount of Losses recovered under
_Section 12.1(a)_ of $300,000,000;

 



 

(c) the Abbott Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_Section 12.2(a)_ for any breach of any representation or warranty
attributable to a single course of conduct or related set of facts, events or
circumstances unless the amount of Losses incurred or suffered by the Abbott
Indemnitees for such breach exceeds $1,000,000;

 



 

(d) the Abbott Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_Section 12.2(a)_ until the aggregate amount which the Abbott Indemnitees
would recover under _Section 12.2(a)_ exceeds $50,000,000, in which case the
Abbott Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover such Losses in excess of
such amount, up to a maximum aggregate amount of Losses recovered under
_Section 12.2(a)_ of $300,000,000;

 



 

(e) the amount of any Loss for which an Indemnified Party may receive
indemnification under this _Article 12_ shall be decreased by any Tax benefit
actually realized, and increased by any Tax cost actually incurred, by such
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss (if
any such Tax benefit is actually realized, or any such Tax cost is actually
incurred, after the applicable indemnity payment is made under this _Article
12_ but before the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, then (i) in
the case of a Tax benefit actually realized, the Indemnified Party shall repay
to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such realization, the amount of such
Tax benefit or (ii) in the case of a Tax cost actually incurred, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, promptly after such
incurrence, the amount of such Tax cost);

 



 

(f) (i) each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to collect
any available Insurance Proceeds in respect of any Loss; _provided_ that such
Indemnified Party need not attempt to so collect prior to making a claim for
indemnification or receiving an indemnity payment in respect of such Loss
under this _Article 12_, (ii) any Loss for which an Indemnified Party may
make a claim shall be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds actually collected by
such Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss and (iii) if an Indemnified
Party receives an indemnity payment in respect of a Loss under this _Article
12_ and subsequently collects any Insurance Proceeds in respect of such Loss,
such Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to
the excess of such indemnity payment received over the amount of such
indemnity payment that would have been due if such Insurance Proceeds had been
collected before such indemnity payment was made; and

 



      
 

 



 

(g) the rights of each Mylan Indemnitee under _Section 12.1_, and the rights
of each Abbott Indemnitee under _Section 12.2_, shall not be affected by any
knowledge at or prior to the execution of this Agreement or at or prior to the
Closing of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
whether such knowledge came from Abbott, any Mylan Party or any other Person.

 



 

12.6 _Currency Conversion_. If the amount of any Losses incurred or suffered
by any Indemnified Party is expressed in a currency other than U.S. Dollars,
any such amounts expressed in a currency other than U.S. Dollars shall be
converted from the applicable currency to U.S. Dollars using the Exchange Rate
as of two (2) U.S. Business Days prior to the date upon which a final
determination as to the payment of such Losses to the Indemnified Party is
made.

 



 

12.7 _Exclusivity_. Except in cases of Willful Breach, from and after the
Closing, recovery pursuant to this _Article 12_ shall constitute the Parties
sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses relating to or arising from
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party hereby
waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
and all other rights, remedies, claims and causes of action (including rights
of contributions, if any), whether in contract, tort or otherwise, known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law, that any Party
may have against the other Party in respect of any breach of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to deny (a)
any Party equitable remedies (including injunctive relief or specific
performance) when any such remedy is otherwise available under this Agreement
or applicable Law or (b) any Party or its Affiliates any remedies under any
Ancillary Agreement, and the foregoing shall not interfere with or impede the
resolution of disputes relating to (i) the Share Allocation by the Allocation
Firm pursuant to _Section 2.11_ or (ii) the Final Modified Working Capital by
the Consultant pursuant to _Section 3.4_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 13**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

13.1 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_
, _however_ , that no Party may assign its rights or delegate any or all of
its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of each Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

13.2 _Public Announcements_. Except for the initial press releases to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
attached hereto as _Exhibit 13.2_, which shall be released contemporaneously
by Abbott and Mylan following the execution of this Agreement, neither Abbott
nor any Mylan Party shall issue or make any public announcement, press release
or other public disclosure regarding this Agreement or its subject matter
without the other Parties prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except for any such disclosure
that is required by applicable Law or the rules of a stock exchange on which
the Securities of the disclosing Party are listed. If a Party is required to
make a public disclosure by applicable Law or the rules of a stock exchange on
which its Securities are listed, such Party shall, to the extent practicable,
submit the proposed

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure in writing to the other Party prior to the date of disclosure and
provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Nothing
in this _Section 13.2_ shall prohibit communications to (i) customers,
employees and other Persons that provide no more information regarding this
Agreement or its subject matter than is contained in the initial press
releases or in any other public disclosure made in accordance with this
Agreement, (ii) Business Employees as described in _Section 8.8_ or (iii) any

consummated, and except as otherwise specified herein, each Party shall bear
its own expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

13.4 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or the application of
such term or provision to Persons or circumstances or in jurisdictions other
than those as to which it has been determined to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, and the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
substitute one or more valid, legal and enforceable terms or provisions into
this Agreement (or the applicable Ancillary Agreement) which, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent of the Parties. Any term or
provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part or degree or within certain jurisdictions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the Parties as
reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Party waives any term or provision of Law which renders any term or provision
of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

 



 

13.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article 12_, (a)
the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Parties and
their permitted successors and assigns and are not intended to confer upon any
Person, except the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns, any
rights or remedies hereunder and (b) there are no third-party beneficiaries of
this Agreement and this Agreement shall not provide any third party with any
remedy, right of Action, Liability, reimbursement or other right in excess of
those existing without reference to this Agreement.

 



 

13.6 _Waiver_. Waiver by either Party of any default by the other Parties of
any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving
Party of any subsequent or other default, nor shall it prejudice the rights of
the waiving Party.

 



 

13.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of New York without
regard to the conflicts of Laws provisions thereof; _provided_ that (a) all
matters relating to the internal corporate affairs of Mylan and the Merger
shall be governed by the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and (b) all
matters relating to the internal corporate affairs of New Mylan as (i) a
private limited liability company ( _besloten vennootschap met beperkte
aansprakelijkheid_ ) or (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

a public limited company ( _naamloze vennootschap_ ), as applicable, shall be
governed by the Laws of the Netherlands.

 



 

13.8 _Jurisdiction_. The Parties agree that any Action seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in
the City of New York, New York so long as such court shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, or alternatively in the New York State Court
located in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, New York if the
aforesaid United States District Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New
York, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably Consents to the jurisdiction
of such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action in any such court or that any such Action which is brought in such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action
may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.14_
shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

 



 

13.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ACTION SEEKING TO ENFORCE ANY PROVISION OF, OR BASED ON ANY
MATTER ARISING OUT OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13.9_.

 



 

13.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the Transferred Business Assets and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, no Party would have an adequate remedy at Law
for money damages in the event that this Agreement has not been performed in
accordance with its terms, and therefore each Party agrees that the other
Parties shall be entitled to specific enforcement of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled (in accordance with
_Section 13.8_), at Law or in equity.

 



 

13.11 _Headings_. The Article, Section and Paragraph headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

13.15 _Construction_. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall be
construed, in all cases, according to its fair meaning. The Parties
acknowledge that each Party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this
Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement. Words in the singular shall be deemed to
include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be deemed to
include the other gender as the context requires. The terms "hereof",
"herein", and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of
the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if". Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedule references are to the Articles
and Sections of, and the Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. Unless otherwise stated, all references to any agreement
shall be deemed to include the exhibits, schedules and annexes to such
agreement. The word "including" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation," unless the context
otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified. The word "or" shall not be
exclusive. The phrase "date hereof" or "date of this Agreement" shall be
deemed to refer to July 13, 2014. The representations and warranties of the
Parties in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made as of July 13,
2014 (other than such representations and warranties as are made as of another
date, including for the purposes of _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_, _Section
12.1_ or _Section 12.2_). Unless otherwise specified in a particular case,
the word "days" refers to calendar days. Where this Agreement states that a
Party "shall" or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to
act, it means that the Party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. References herein to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement as of the date of such agreement and as
it may be amended thereafter, unless otherwise specified. References herein to
a statute include the statute and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. When used in relation to, or when used in determining the use of,
the Business or any assets, Liabilities or employees, "primarily" shall mean
more than fifty percent (50%).

 



      
 

 



 

13.16 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified by
the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Mylan, but after such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law or in accordance with the
rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market requires further approval by such
shareholders without such further approval. Without limiting the foregoing,
this Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

13.17 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement of the Parties with
