#### (iii) US$315,000,000 with respect to Fundamental Losses; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) the Closing Proceeds with respect to Broker Losses and Losses for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under
Section 8.4(ii).

  

#### 

  

### (d) If the Closing occurs, no party shall be entitled to any recovery
unless a claim for indemnification is made (i) in accordance with this
Section 8 and before the date that is (A) the 12 month anniversary of the
Closing Date with respect to Breaches for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(i) other than Sections 3.1,
3.2, 3.3, 3.8, 3.17, 3.21 and 3.22; (B) the 24 month anniversary of the
Closing Date for all Breaches of Section 3.21; (C) the later of the 60 month
anniversary of the day on which the Cinemex Companies (i) are or were
required to file or (ii) effectively file the relevant Tax Return with the
relevant Governmental Body in Mexico for the tax period in which the Taxes
were incurred relating to a Pre-Closing or

  



        
   

  



  

### Straddle Tax Period for all Breaches of Section 3.8 or Losses for which
the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section
8.4(v); (D) the 60 month anniversary of the Closing Date for Breaches of
Section 3.17; (E) at any time for all Breaches of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and
3.22; (F) at any time for Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are

this Section 8 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss and
shall be reduced to take account of any Tax Benefit realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss;
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to recover amounts under insurance policies with respect to such
loss.

  

### 

  

### "Tax Benefit" means the amount by which the tax liability of a
corporation to the appropriate taxing authority is reduced by deduction,
credit or otherwise or the amount by which a refund of Taxes is increased,
_provided_ that such reduction of tax liability or such refund of Taxes is
"realized" in the taxable year during which an indemnity payment is made
pursuant to this Agreement or in a taxable year prior to the year
such payment is made. A Tax Benefit shall be deemed to have been "realized"
at the time of occurrence of the fact or event giving rise to any refund of
Taxes or at the time that a loss, deduction or credit is incurred or allowed
that results in reduction of Taxes that would otherwise be due for that tax
year or for a prior tax year; in the event any of the Cinemex Companies has
other losses, deductions, credits or similar items available to it, losses,
deductions, credits or such other items for which the Sellers would be
entitled to reduce its indemnification obligations pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as the last items utilized to produce a Tax Benefit.

  

### 

  

### (f) No Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Agreement
to the extent that such Indemnified Partys Losses are increased or extended
by the willful misconduct, violation of Applicable Law or bad faith of such
Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

## 8.6. INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES

  

## 

  

### (a) Each Indemnified Party shall, promptly after the receipt of notice of
a written threat or the commencement of any action against such

  



        
   

  



  

### Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 8, notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing thereof, stating, to the extent known, the name of the Person
threatening or commencing such action and a brief statement of the basis for
any claim of indemnity for Losses.

  

### 

  

### (b) The failure of any Indemnified Party to so notify an Indemnifying
Party of any such action shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability except to the extent that the rights of such Indemnifying Party are
prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party
is per se prejudiced if delivery of a notice specifying in reasonable detail
the basis for an indemnification claim under this Section 8 is delivered
after the time period set forth in Section 8.5(d).

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to any action notified by an Indemnified Party to an
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 8, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent it may wish, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, and after written notice from the Indemnifying Party to
such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this
Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation.

  

### 

  

### (d) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim for Losses pursuant to this Section 8, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which
the Indemnified Party may have against any other parties with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Indemnifying Parties shall not settle any action for which an
Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder without
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, _provided_  that the consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required so long as the settlement (i) only
provides for the payment of monetary damages by the Indemnifying Parties,
(ii) does not restrict the conduct or business activities of any of the
Indemnified Parties and (iii) provides a complete and full release from all
liability to the Indemnified Party.

  



        
   

  



  

## 8.7. TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS

  

## 

  

Buyers and Sellers agree that any indemnity payments made pursuant to this
Section 8 will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  



  

# 9. TERMINATION

  

# 

  

## 9.1. TERMINATION EVENTS

  



  

This Agreement may, by notice given prior to or at the Closing,
be terminated:

  



  

### (a) by either Buyers or Sellers if the Closing has not occurred (other
than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
comply in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement) on
or before February 26, 2009, or such later date as the parties may agree upon
(the "Outside Date");

  

### 

  

### (b) by Buyers if a supplement to the Disclosure Statement by Sellers
contains changes or disclosure that, individually or in the aggregate with
any other supplements, has or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change;

  

### 

  

### (c) by mutual consent of Buyers and Sellers; or

  

### 

  

### (d) by Sellers, if a resolution satisfactory to Sellers is not issued by
the Mexican Federal Competition Commission within 65 Business Days following
the submission by the parties of the required notification form(s).

  



  

## 9.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION

  



  

### Each partys right of termination under Section 9.1 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise
of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, all further obligations of
the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations
in Sections 12.1, 12.3, 12.13 and 12.14, and paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of
Section 12.17, will survive and any liability arising from any intentional
Breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated by a
party because one or more of the conditions to the terminating partys
obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other
partys failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the
terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.

# 11. TAX MATTERS

  

# 

  

## 11.1. TRANSFER TAXES

  

## 

  

Other than income Taxes, all documentary, sales, stamp, registration and
other such similar Taxes and fees applicable under Mexican law and incurred
in connection with this Agreement, if any, shall be paid by Buyers when due,
and Buyers shall, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees, and if required by
applicable law, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Related Persons to, join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

  



  

## 11.2. PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS

  

## 

  

### (a) The Cinemex Companies and Symphony shall, and Sellers shall cause the
Cinemex Companies and Symphony to, prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed in a manner consistent with past practice, all Tax
Returns of, with respect to, or including the Cinemex Companies and/or
Symphony that are required to be filed (taking into account extensions) on or
before the Closing Date. Sellers shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid
by the Cinemex Companies and Symphony all Taxes shown as due, or required to
be shown as due, on such Tax Returns. Sellers shall be entitled to receive
any refund or credit reflected on such Tax Returns which is not received on
or before the Closing Date (a "Pending Refund"), as described in Section
11.3(e).

  



  

(b) Buyers shall cause the Cinemex Companies and Symphony to prepare and file
all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to such Cinemex
Companies and/or Symphony for all Taxable Periods that (x) begin on or after
January 1, 2008 and prior to the Closing Date and (y) end on, before or after
the Closing Date (including Tax Returns for Straddle Periods), which Tax
Returns have due dates (taking into account extensions) after the Closing
Date (the "Post-Closing Returns"). To the extent that the parties have agreed
to the Tax treatment of specific items (including the provisions of
this Agreement), such Post-Closing Returns will be prepared consistent with
such agreement between the parties and otherwise in a manner consistent with
Tax Returns filed by the Cinemex Companies and Symphony prior to the Closing
Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements. Sellers
shall cooperate with Buyers and the Cinemex Companies and Symphony in the
preparation of Post-Closing Returns and shall provide assistance as
reasonably requested by Buyers. In the case of a Post-Closing Return
required to be filed in Mexico by the Cinemex Companies and/or Symphony,
including any Tax Return for Mexican Income Tax filed on a consolidated basis
for or including the Cinemex Companies ("Mexican Consolidated Income Tax
Return"), and any

  



        

  



  

### Tax Return for IETU or Mexican VAT required and/or permitted to be filed
under Mexican Legal Requirements (a "Mexican Post-Closing Return"), Buyers
shall use a person acceptable to Sellers, which may be Felix Nunez Gamboa
("Gamboa") if he is available on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyers, to
prepare such Mexican Post-Closing Return. Buyers will provide Sellers with
access to the books and records of the Cinemex Companies and Symphony to the
extent reasonably relevant to the preparation and review of any Post-Closing
Return. Buyers shall cause Cinemex Companies and Symphony to provide each
Post-Closing Return to Sellers at least twenty (20) days prior to filing such
Post-Closing Return for Sellers review and comment. Such Post-Closing
Return shall be final and binding on the parties unless either Sellers or
Buyers deliver to the other a Notice of Objection within twenty (20) days
after delivery of the Post-Closing Return to Sellers. Buyers and Sellers shall
utilize the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(c) to settle any disputed
item included in a Notice of Objection.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Cinemex Companies are unable or otherwise fail to file a
Mexican Consolidated Income Tax Return for the Tax year ending December 31 of
the year of Closing, then prior to the following June 25th, Buyers shall
cause the Cinemex Companies to prepare and provide to Sellers a form
of Mexican Consolidated Income Tax Return for the period ending on the
Closing Date as if the Cinemex Companies were able to file a Mexican
Consolidated Income Tax Return, for Sellers review and comment.  Subject to
the provisions of Section 11.3 relating to resolution of any disputed item,
Buyers shall cause the Cinemex Companies to make such revisions to such form
of Mexican Consolidated Income Tax Return as are reasonably requested by
Sellers. Any refund or credit, or additional Tax due, as reflected on the
final form of Mexican Consolidated Income Tax Return, shall be substituted
for the amounts of refund or credit, or additional Tax due, as reflected on
all Mexican Income Tax Returns for the individual Cinemex Companies for
purposes of applying Section 11.3, and the amount of refund or credit shall
be deemed received by the Cinemex Companies on August 15 of the calendar year
after Closing for purposes of applying Section 11.3.

  

### 

  

## 11.3. TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS

  

## 

  

### (a) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Taxable
Period of the Cinemex Companies and/or Symphony that begins on or before, and
ends after, the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such
Tax ("Straddle Period Tax") that is allocable to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  



        
   

  



  

#### (i) in the case of Taxes (including Specified Taxes and social security
taxes, payroll taxes, INFONAVIT and SAR) that are either (A) based upon or
related to income or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any
withholding obligation, any obligation related to payroll, any actual or
deemed value added tax, sale or other transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable by the Cinemex Companies or Symphony, as the case may be
(after giving effect to amounts which would be deductible in the computation
of, or offset against, such Taxes, including any loss or credit carryforwards
from prior years, which loss or credit carryforwards will be allocated first
to the computation of, or offset against, Taxes allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) if the Taxable Period ended
on the Closing Date, and the parties shall elect to do so if permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets of the Cinemex Companies and/or Symphony, or otherwise measured by
the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes based
upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, such Tax shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.3(a), all payments under
Sections 2.2(c) and 2.2(d) shall be treated for Tax purposes as having been
made on the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Taxable
Period that begins on or after January 1, 2008 and ends on or before the
Closing Date that are reported on a Post-Closing Return, Sellers shall be
responsible for any Taxes due with the original Post-Closing Return in
accordance with Section 11.3(e) and shall be entitled to receive any refund
of Taxes shown on the original Post-Closing Return in accordance with Section
11.3(f).

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) Buyers shall cause the Cinemex Companies and Symphony to prepare and
provide Sellers with calculations of the allocation to Sellers of any
Straddle Period Tax and the amount of any credit against such Straddle Period
Tax, together with a calculation of Sellers allocable share of any refund or
credit ("Straddle Period Tax Calculation"), determined in the manner
described in Sections 11.3(a) and (b), at the same time that Buyers provide a
copy of the applicable Post-Closing Return for Sellers review pursuant to
Section 11.2(b). Unless Sellers provide Buyers with a Notice of Objection to
any Post-Closing Return or any Straddle Period Tax Calculation within twenty
(20) days after delivery thereof to Sellers, such Post-Closing Return or
Straddle Period Tax Calculation shall be final and binding on the parties.
Buyers and Sellers shall utilize the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(c)
to settle any disputed item included in a Notice of Objection or otherwise
for a Post-Closing Return or Straddle Period Tax Calculation.  Any Post-
Closing Return filed with respect to a disputed item shall be filed
consistent with the final resolution of such disputed item.

  

### 

  

### (e) No later than twenty (20) days after the earlier of (i) 21 days after
the delivery of the Straddle Period Tax Calculation, if no Notice of
Objection is filed, or (ii) the final resolution of any disputed items on any
original Post-Closing Return, Sellers shall pay to Buyers the Tax reflected
on such Post-Closing Return (as amended to reflect the resolution of any
disputed item) for a period other than a Straddle Period and Sellers
allocable share of any Straddle Period Tax as provided in the Straddle Period
Tax Calculation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be
obligated to pay any such Tax to the extent included in Current
Liabilities as finally determined under Section 2.3.  The parties
acknowledge and agree that Specified Taxes shall not be included in Current
Assets or Current Liabilities under Section 2.3.

  

### 

  

### (f) No later than ten (10) days after any Pending Refund, Tax refund for
a Post-Closing Return described in Section 11.3(c), or Tax refund for
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date is received or
credit is allowed or applied against another Tax liability by a Taxing
Authority, Buyers shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers any such Pending
Refund and any such Tax refund or credit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers shall not be entitled to a refund or credit of Tax to the extent
included in Current Assets as finally determined under Section 2.3.

  

### 

  

### (g) For purposes of determining the amount of Taxes payable by Sellers
and the amount of Tax refunds (including any Pending Refunds) and credits
payable to Sellers under this Section 11,

  



        
   

  



  

### Sellers shall be deemed to have paid toward Taxes for which they are
responsible (i) all Tax payments made on or before the Closing Date by or on
behalf of the Cinemex Companies or Symphony, including estimated payments of
the Specified Taxes, and (ii) without duplication, all Tax payments and
accruals that are included in Aggregate Working Capital as finally determined
under Schedule 2.3.

  

### 

  

### (h) Buyers shall not take any action (including making any election)
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business that will increase the amount
of Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible under this Agreement,
including any Straddle Period Tax.

  



  

## 11.4. TAX COOPERATION AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

  



  

Buyers and Sellers shall (a) after the Closing, assist (and cause any
respective Related Person to assist) in preparing and filing any Tax Returns
that either party is responsible for preparing and filing with respect to the
Cinemex Companies or Symphony, (b) after the Closing, cooperate fully in
preparing for any audits of, or disputes or other Proceedings with any Taxing
Authority or with respect to any matters with respect to Taxes of or relating
to the Cinemex Companies or Symphony and (c) make available to either party
and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably requested all information, records,
and documents relating to Tax matters (including Tax Returns) of or relating
to the Cinemex Companies or Symphony relating to any Taxable Period that
begins on or before the Closing Date and will preserve such information,
records, or documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations or extensions thereof.  Each party shall keep any information
obtained under this Section 11.4 confidential except (i) as may be necessary
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or the
conduct of any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes or
(ii) with the consent of the other party hereto.

  



  

## 11.5. CONTESTS

  

## 

  

### (a) After the Closing Date, Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing within
ten (10) days of receiving notice of a proposed assessment or the
commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial Proceeding or of
any demand or claim on Buyers or the Cinemex Companies or Symphony, which, if
determined adversely to such party or after the lapse of time, could have an
adverse effect on Sellers. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known to Buyers and the Cinemex Companies or Symphony or any
Related Person of such party) briefly describing the asserted Tax liability
and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any
Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

  



        
   

  



  

### The failure of Buyers to provide Sellers such notice shall not release
Sellers from their obligations under this Agreement except to the extent
Sellers have been materially prejudiced by the failure to receive such
notice.

  

### 

  

### (b) Except as provided below, in the case of a Tax audit or
administrative or judicial Proceeding (a "Contest") that relates to Taxable
Periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date or to any Straddle Period
pursuant to which Contest Sellers could be liable for indemnification or
could be entitled to a Tax refund from a Taxing Authority pursuant to this
Agreement, Sellers shall have the right, at their expense, to participate in
or, at the option of Buyers, control the conduct of such Contest; _provided_
that, even if Buyers opt to permit Sellers to control the conduct of such
Contest, Sellers (i) shall permit Buyers to participate in the Proceeding and
to monitor the progress of such Proceeding, and (ii) if such settlement or
compromise would have an adverse effect on the Cinemex Companies, Symphony or
Buyers, individually or in the aggregate, shall not settle or otherwise
compromise such Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyers (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not have the right to control
any Contest pursuant to which Sellers would reasonably be expected to be
entitled to a Tax refund if the outcome of such contest could have an adverse
effect on the Cinemex Companies, Symphony, or Buyers, individually or in the
aggregate. In the case of a Contest that relates to the income tax returns of
any of the Cinemex Companies or Symphony (an "Income Tax Contest") that
relates to Taxable Periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant
to which Contest Sellers could be liable for indemnification or could be
entitled to a Tax refund from a Taxing Authority pursuant to this Agreement,
Sellers shall have the right, at their expense, to control the conduct of
such Income Tax Contest, and, pursuant to Section 11.4, Buyers will cause
Cinemex Companies to provide Sellers with reasonable assistance and access to
the books and records of such Cinemex Company or Symphony as it relates to
the Income Tax Contest, _provided_ that Sellers (i) shall permit Buyers to
participate in the Income Tax Contest and to monitor the progress of such
Contest and (ii) if such settlement or compromise would have an adverse
effect on the Cinemex Companies, Symphony or Buyers, individually or in the
aggregate, shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Income Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of Buyers (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers shall not be entitled to control any Contest if such Contest,

  



        
   

  



  

### alone or in conjunction with other Contests, could reasonably be expected
to result in Losses that exceed the Tax Loss Cap. Any Tax adjustment
(including restatement by inflation, surcharges, penalties and fines)
assessed as a consequence of the conclusion of a Tax audit or administrative
or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on Buyers or the Cinemex
Companies corresponding to a taxable period that (A) ends on or before the
Closing Date or (B) is allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, (x) shall be paid by Sellers to
Buyers if the Tax adjustment requires payment of additional Taxes, subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.5 as if such additional Taxes
were Losses subject to indemnification under Section 8.4(i) and (y) shall be
paid by or at the direction of Buyers to Sellers if the Tax
adjustment results in a credit or refund of Taxes.

  



  

## 11.6. MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

For Tax purposes, unless otherwise provided for by Legal Requirement, the
parties hereto agree to treat any payment pursuant to this Section 11 and any
other indemnification payment made under Section 8 or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of
this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

## 12.6. WAIVER

  

## 

  

The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising
any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or
privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or
privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power,
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out
of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be
discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of
the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver
that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right
of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to
in this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

## 12.7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION

  

## 

  

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the parties
with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the
documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement
of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject
matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement
executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

  



  

## 12.8. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

  

## 

  

In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the Disclosure Statement (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Statement with
respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control. Any reference in a
particular section or part of the Disclosure Statement shall be deemed to be
an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in (a) the corresponding Section of this Agreement
and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that is
contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties is reasonably apparent on its face or an appropriate cross-
reference is provided.

  



  

## 12.9. ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

  

## 

  

### (a) Neither party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement
without the prior consent of the other parties, which will not be
unreasonably withheld. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of
the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.
This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
assigns.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers
shall have the right to transfer a portion of the Shares to affiliates of
Sellers prior to the Closing Date, but only to the extent that such transfer
does not result in, or is not reasonably likely to have, a material adverse
effect on the Cinemex Companies tax contribution position ( _cuenta de
capital de aportaci on_), in which case any Sellers that do not own any
Shares as of the Closing Date will be released and the transferee affiliates
of Sellers owning Shares will be joined as parties to this Agreement and
Buyers may

  



        
   

  



  

### assign their rights and obligations hereunder; _provided_ that the
assigning Seller or Buyer shall remain liable for the obligations hereunder
so assigned.

  



  

## 12.10. SEVERABILITY

  



  

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  Any provision of this Agreement held
invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and
effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any
claims that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, that
such action or suit is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of
such action, suit or other proceeding is improper. Each of the parties
hereto also hereby agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against

be conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or

  



        
   

  



  

judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either

## 12.17. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES; ATTORNEYS FEES

  

## 

  

### (a) The parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by Sellers in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise Breached by Sellers, irreparable damage would occur to Buyers, no
adequate remedy at law would exist for Buyers and damages would be difficult
to determine, and that prior to the termination of this Agreement Buyers will
be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity without need of posting any
bond or security.

  

### 

  

### (b) The parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by Buyers in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise Breached by Buyers, irreparable damage would occur to Sellers, no
adequate remedy at law would exist for Sellers and damages would be difficult
to determine, and that prior to the termination of this Agreement Sellers
will be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity without need of posting any
bond or security.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event that (i) the conditions to Sellers obligation to close
the Contemplated Transactions set forth in Section 7 have been satisfied or
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law waived and Sellers are not then
in Breach of this Agreement and (ii) all of the

  



        
   

  



  

### conditions to Buyers obligation to close set forth in Sections 6 have
been satisfied or to the extent permitted by Applicable Law waived and Buyers
do not consummate the Closing, then, if Sellers terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(a), Sellers shall be entitled to liquidated damages
from Entretenimiento in the amount of US$50,000,000, together with interest
on such amount at 9% _per annum_  until paid (the "Seller Liquidated
Damages").  The parties agree that the Seller Liquidated Damages are not
intended as a penalty but as liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Sellers for Buyers failure to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. The rights and remedies of Sellers provided by this Section
12.17(c) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers after termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(a).

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event that: (i) the conditions to Buyers obligation to close
the Contemplated Transactions set forth in Section 6 have been satisfied or
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law waived and Buyers are not then in
Breach of this Agreement and (ii) all of the conditions to Sellers
obligation to close set forth in Section 7 have been satisfied or to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law waived and Sellers do not consummate the
Closing, then, if Buyers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(a),
Buyers shall be entitled to liquidated damages from Sellers in the amount of
US$50,000,000, together with interest on such amount at 9% _per annum_
until paid (the "Buyer Liquidated Damages").  The parties agree that the
Buyer Liquidated Damages are not intended as a penalty but as liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Buyers for Sellers
failure to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The rights and remedies
of Buyers provided by this Section 12.17(d) shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyers after
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(a).

  

### 

  

### (e) If a party is successful in any suit or proceeding against the other
party to enforce this Agreement or because of any damages sustained by a
party due to the other partys Breach of this Agreement, the losing party
will pay the prevailing party, in addition to other costs and damages, its
reasonable attorneys fees.

  



        

  



  

## 12.18. EFFECT OF INVESTIGATION

  

## 

  

### No investigation conducted by any party or any partys respective
affiliates or Representatives made heretofore or hereafter shall affect the
representations and warranties of any party hereto contained herein or the
indemnification obligations of the Sellers set forth in Section 8 and Section
11.

  

### 

  

## 12.19. NO SUBROGATION

  

## 

  

### Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any and
all rights of subrogation against or with respect to any of the Cinemex
Companies or any Person that becomes an affiliate of the Cinemex Companies
after the Closing of the obligations under the Inbursa Loan Agreement which
the Sellers may at any time otherwise have as a result of the repayment by,
or on behalf of, the Cinemex Companies of any or all of the obligations of
the Cinemex Companies under the Inbursa Loan Agreement.
