AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 3,
2013, is made by and among Financial Pacific Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), Financial Pacific Leasing, LLC, a Washington
limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
("Leasing"), Umpqua Holdings Corporation, an Oregon corporation ("Parent"),
Umpqua Bank, a banking corporation incorporated under the laws of Oregon
("Bank"), Aquarium Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Bank ("Merger Sub") and Financial Pacific Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and sole stockholder of the Company
("Stockholder"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings set forth in Article X below.

WHEREAS, Parent and the Bank desire to acquire the Company on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to which (i) Parent will
purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Designated
Subsidiaries from Leasing (the "Stock Purchase") and (ii) Merger Sub will, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge
with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company as the surviving
corporation in the Merger, with the Stock Purchase and the Merger each
effective as of the Effective Time;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or equivalent governing body) of
Parent, Merger Sub, Leasing and the Company have approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, having determined that the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are in the respective
best interests of Parent, Merger Sub, Leasing and the Company, as the case may
be, and their respective stockholders;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or equivalent governing body) of
Merger Sub and the Company have declared the advisability of this Agreement
and recommended adoption of this Agreement by their respective stockholders;
and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Article I 

THE MERGER AND THE STOCK PURCHASE

1.01 The Merger.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall merge with and into the Company in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and
shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of
Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease.

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the
DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

1.02 Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Company and Merger Sub.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Bank, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of
common stock of Merger Sub or any holder of Company Common Stock:

(i) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(ii) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) Conversion of Company Common Stock. The Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 1.02(a)(ii)) shall be converted into the
right to receive:

(A) the Closing Consideration; and

(B) the Additional Merger Consideration, if any.

1.03 Exchange of Shares of Company Common Stock. Parent and Bank shall effect
the delivery of the Merger Consideration to Stockholder in exchange for all
shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and entitled to payment pursuant to Section 1.02, as
provided in Sections 1.09 and 2.02(b).

1.04 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law,
except that it shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving
Corporation to "Financial Pacific Funding Corp."

1.05 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable Law.

1.06 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law,
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

1.07 Closing Calculations.

(a) Not less than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent (i) a good faith estimated unaudited
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the open of business
on the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"),


(ii) a good faith estimate of Tangible Net Worth (the "Estimated Tangible Net
Worth") and (iii) a statement of the Transaction Expenses. The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared and Estimated Tangible Net Worth shall
be determined using the Agreed Accounting Principles. Not less than three
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall notify
Stockholder in reasonable detail if it disputes any aspect of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet or the Estimated Tangible Net Worth and Parent's
estimate of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Tangible Net
Worth. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Stockholder shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such dispute, and any changes resulting from such
negotiation shall be part of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Tangible Net Worth for all purposes under this Agreement; provided,
however, that if Parent and Stockholder are unable to resolve any such dispute
within two Business Days after Parent notifies Stockholder of such dispute,
then for purposes of this Section 1.07(a), each disputed amount shall be
resolved for purposes of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated
Tangible Net Worth by using the arithmetic mean of the amounts proposed by
Parent and Stockholder.

(b) The Company's Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and calculations of
Estimated Tangible Net Worth delivered pursuant to Section 1.07(a) will be
deemed automatically withdrawn and will no longer be effective if the Closing
does not occur within five Business Days after delivery of such items, and
Section 1.07(a) will apply once again with respect to any Closing Date
occurring subsequently.

1.08 Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation. As promptly as possible, but in
any event within 75 days after the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to
Stockholder an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of the open of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing
Balance Sheet"), and a statement showing its good faith calculation of
Tangible Net Worth derived from the Closing Balance Sheet (together with the
Closing Balance Sheet, the "Preliminary Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared and Tangible Net Worth shall be determined using the Agreed
Accounting Principles. After delivery of the Preliminary Statement, Parent
shall reasonably cooperate with Stockholder's review of the Preliminary
Statement, including by giving Stockholder and its accountants and other
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to review the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' books and records and any work papers related
to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement. If Stockholder has any
objections to the Preliminary Statement, Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a
statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections Statement"). If
an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after
delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Preliminary Statement shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. Stockholder and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, Stockholder and Parent shall submit such dispute to Duff
and Phelps, or if such firm is unwilling or unable to be engaged in such
capacity, an independent valuation firm of national reputation who does not
have a relationship with either Stockholder or Parent, as agreed between
Stockholder and Parent (the "Dispute Resolution Arbiter"). Any further
submissions to the Dispute Resolution Arbiter must be written and delivered to
each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only
those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement as
being items which Stockholder and Parent are unable to resolve. The Dispute
Resolution Arbiter's determination will be made in accordance with the
definitions of Agreed Accounting Principles and Tangible Net Worth contained
herein and the provisions of this Section 1.08. Stockholder and Parent shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable. Further, the
Dispute Resolution Arbiter's determination shall be based solely on the
presentations by Parent and Stockholder which are in accordance with the terms
and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter shall be final and binding on and nonâ€‘appealable by the parties
hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be
allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and Stockholder, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party.
For example, if Stockholder claims Tangible Net Worth is $1,000 greater than
the amount determined by Parent, and Parent contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by Stockholder, and if the Dispute Resolution Arbiter ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Stockholder $300 of the $500 contested, then
the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 Ã· 500)
to Parent and 40% (i.e., 200 Ã· 500) to Stockholder.

1.09 Post-Closing Adjustment Payment. If the Final Consideration is greater
than the Closing Consideration, Parent and/or Bank shall promptly (but in any
event within five Business Days) pay to Stockholder the amount of such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Stockholder to Parent. If the Final
Consideration is less than the Closing Consideration, Stockholder shall
promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) pay to Parent and/or
Bank the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent to
Stockholder.

1.10 Stock Purchase. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, at the Effective Time, Leasing shall sell,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Parent, and Parent shall purchase and
acquire from Leasing, in exchange for good and valuable consideration the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock (or shares in the share capital) of each of the
Designated Subsidiaries.

1.11 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, Bank, Merger Sub, and the Company (and any other Person that has a
payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any
amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable U.S. federal, state or local or
foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Parent, Bank, Merger Sub or the Company and paid to the appropriate taxing
authority in accordance with applicable Law, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to Stockholder or such other Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made by Parent, Bank, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable.

ARTICLE II

2.01 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis
LLP located at 300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 a.m. local

all of the closing conditions set forth in Article III (other than those to be

referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

Certificates");

(d) Parent and/or Bank shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the

date) (without giving effect to qualifications relating to materiality,
Company Material Adverse Effect, or similar phrases in the representations and

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND LEASING

The Company (and, solely with respect to Sections 4.01, 4.02, and 4.03(a),
Leasing, provided, that this parenthetical shall not limit the representation
or warranties of the Company in this Article IV) represent and warrant to
Parent that the statements in this Article IV are correct and complete as of
the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules.

4.01 Organization and Power; Subsidiaries. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized, and is
validly existing and, where such concept is recognized, in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case
may be, except to the extent the failure of any such Subsidiary to be in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Subsidiary Schedule attached hereto contains a correct and complete list of
all of the Company's Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary and the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons
in each such Subsidiary. Except as set forth on the Subsidiary Schedule, the
Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company owns all of the
outstanding ownership interest in each Subsidiary of the Company, and Leasing
owns all of the outstanding ownership interest in each of the Designated
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens or other encumbrances, and such
ownership interests have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.02 Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement; No Conflicts.

(a) The Company and Leasing each have all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform their respective
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
Leasing and the consummation by the Company and Leasing of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
and Leasing and no stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than, with respect
to the Merger, the Stockholder Approval. The board of directors of the Company
has determined unanimously that this Agreement is advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and Stockholder and has directed that this Agreement
be submitted to Stockholder for approval and adoption. The board of managers
of Leasing has determined unanimously that this Agreement is advisable and in
the best interests of Leasing and its members. This Agreement has been duly
authorized and validly executed and delivered by the Company and Leasing, and,
assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent,
Bank and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of the Company and Leasing, enforceable against each of the
Company and Leasing in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies.

(b) The execution and delivery by the Company and Leasing of this Agreement do
not, and the performance by the Company and Leasing of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and by Leasing of the Stock Purchase
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) assuming the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate any provision of
the Company's or Leasing's organizational documents, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations described in the attached Company
Governmental Consents Schedule will have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time and all filings and notifications described in the attached Company
Governmental Consents Schedule will have been made and any waiting periods
thereunder will have terminated or expired prior to the Effective Time,
conflict with or violate in any material respect any Law applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii) require any
consent or approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit
under, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound, except, with respect to clause (iii), (x) as set forth on
the attached Authorization Schedule or (y) for matters that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

7.02 Access to Books and Records. Subject to Section 8.05, from the date
hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent and its
authorized representatives (the "Parent's Representative") with reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to the offices,
properties, senior personnel, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in order for Parent to have the opportunity to make such
investigation as it shall reasonably desire to make of the affairs of the

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) any other information that
is protected by applicable Law (including privacy Laws) or contract and to
which Parent or Parent's Representative is afforded access pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it would
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose information subject
to attorney-client privilege or conflict with any third party confidentiality
obligations to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound,
provided, that the Company uses its commercially reasonable efforts to make
alternative arrangements to provide the requested access or examination.
Parent acknowledges that Parent is and remains bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement, between Parent and Stockholder dated December 18, 2012 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

7.03 Regulatory Filings. The Company shall, within ten Business Days after the
date hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under the
HSR Act in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein. The Company also shall provide or cause to be provided the notices,
make or cause to be made the filings and obtain the authorizations, waivers,
consents or approvals, set forth on the attached Company Regulatory Schedule.
The Company shall coordinate and cooperate with Parent in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with all of the foregoing and all filings and submissions under the

non-objections or other requirements. In connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein, the Company shall promptly comply with
any additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Entities. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any governmental or third party consents, waivers,
authorizations or approvals set forth on Schedule 3.01(e) which may be
required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and to consummate such transactions as promptly as
practicable. The Company shall diligently assist and cooperate with Parent in

Affiliates to any Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in obtaining any governmental or third party consents,
waivers, authorizations or approvals which may be required to be obtained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (which assistance and cooperation shall include timely
furnishing to Parent all information concerning the Company and/or its
Affiliates that counsel to Parent reasonably determines is required to be
included in such documents or would be helpful in obtaining such required
consent, waiver, authorization or approval, in each case, only to the extent
the Company possesses such information). The Company shall request and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act.

7.04 Conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in Article
III).

7.05 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01, neither the Company or any of its advisors, officers, directors,
agents, stockholders, subsidiaries or controlled affiliates nor Stockholder or
any of its advisors, officers, directors, agents, members, managers,
stockholders, subsidiaries or controlled affiliates (Stockholder, collectively
with the Company and all such persons and entities, the "Stockholder Group")
shall initiate, solicit, negotiate, or accept, directly or indirectly, any
proposal or offer from any person or group of persons other than Parent and
its affiliates (an "Acquisition Proposal") to acquire all or any significant
part of the business and properties, ownership interests, capital stock or
capital stock equivalents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
by merger, purchase of stock or ownership interests, purchase of assets,
tender offer or otherwise, or provide any non-public information to any third
party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided
that this Section 7.05 shall not apply to the Company or Stockholder in
connection with any communications to Stockholder or its members related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.06 Payoff Letters. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek payoff letters in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent reflecting all
Indebtedness to be paid pursuant to Section 2.02(d) and to have such payoff
letters delivered no later than two Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
payoff letters to include assurances that if the amount identified therein is
paid to such payee on the Closing Date, the applicable Indebtedness shall be
repaid in full and that, as of such payment, (i) all Liens or other
encumbrances securing such Indebtedness affecting any real or personal
property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be released, (ii) all
security filings made or entered into with respect to such Liens or
encumbrances will be canceled or terminated, and (iii) all instruments,
certificates and other property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries held
as collateral securing such Indebtedness will be returned.

7.07 Stockholder Approval. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company will, in accordance with applicable Law and its organizational
documents, use commercially reasonable efforts in order to obtain the
Stockholder Approval through a written consent as promptly as practicable. The
board of directors of the Company shall recommend approval of the Merger and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit such approval.

7.08 Section 280G. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit to a
vote of the members of Stockholder for their determination all payments or
benefits that in the absence of such a vote would reasonably be expected to be
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations thereunder), with such vote to meet the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and to be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be so required to the extent the recipient of such payments or benefits
does not agree to the waiver of such payments or benefits as contemplated by
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder. The parties acknowledge that this Section 7.08 shall not apply to
any arrangements entered into at the direction of Parent or Merger Sub or
between Parent and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a disqualified
individual on the other hand unless such arrangements have been entered into
in advance of the vote and provided to the Company ("Buyer Arrangements") so
that, for the avoidance of doubt, unless such arrangements have been entered
into in advance of the vote and provided to the Company, compliance with this
Section 7.08 shall be determined as if such Buyer Arrangements had not been
entered into. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that the
Company cannot compel any disqualified individual to waive any existing rights
under a contract or agreement with Stockholder, the Company or any Subsidiary
and in no event shall the Company be deemed in breach of this Section 7.08 if
any such disqualified person refuses to waive any such right. For the
avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Company's requirement to submit
such matters to a vote of the members of Stockholder, neither the Stockholder,
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to make any payment
or incur any obligation to any Person in order to induce any disqualified
individual to waive any existing rights under a contract or agreement with
Stockholder, the Company or any Subsidiary.

7.09 Conversion of Retained Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall cause each subsidiary of the Company which is a limited liability
company to be converted to a corporation (the "Conversions") through the
filing of a certificate of conversion (or similar process) with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or Washington, as applicable, and shall
cause each such subsidiary to adopt a certificate of incorporation and bylaws
in a form as agreed between the Company and Parent.

7.10 Affiliated Transactions. Each agreement, contract, commitment and
transaction required to be set forth on the Affiliated Transactions Schedule
and marked with an asterisk therein shall be terminated as of the Effective
Time, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
liability under any such agreement, contract, commitment or transaction
following the Effective Time.

ARTICLE VIII 

COVENANTS OF PARENT, BANK and MERGER SUB

8.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing and until the
seventh (7th) anniversary thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company
and Bank to, provide Stockholder and its authorized representatives with
reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including Tax work papers) with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date, to the extent that
such access may be reasonably required in connection with respect to any Tax
audits, Tax Returns, insurance claims, governmental investigations, legal
compliance, financial statement preparation or for purposes of Stockholder
demonstrating its or the Company's and its Subsidiaries' compliance with the
terms of this Agreement; provided that such persons shall conduct such
examination at times and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the business of the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, shall
reimburse Parent promptly for all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with any such request, and shall not be
entitled to access any protected personal information relating to clients of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Stockholder, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Bank, the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven years following the Closing Date,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date without
first giving reasonable prior notice to Stockholder and offering to surrender
to Stockholder such books and records or any portion thereof which Parent,
Bank or the Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

8.02 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(c) From and after the Closing Date until six years from the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall otherwise cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the
Closing Date were directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "DandO Indemnitees") with respect to all claims,
actions, proceedings or investigations arising out of acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such at any time on or prior to the Closing Date
(each, a "Covered Claim"). For purposes of clarity, a Covered Claim shall not
include any claim made by Stockholder or its affiliates against any DandO
Indemnitee or any claim made against a DandO Indemnitee (or any matter for which
a claim could be made against a Covered DandO Indemnitee) pursuant to Article
XI. In addition, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance, pay and/or reimburse any expenses of any DandO Indemnitee in connection
with any matter for which indemnification is available under this Section
8.02(a) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

(d) For a period of six years after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain director and
officer liability insurance, which insurance shall provide coverage for the
DandO Indemnitees comparable to the policy or policies maintained by the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such
individuals. Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied this Section 8.02(b) if
a prepaid insurance policy or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been
obtained by the Surviving Corporation (at Parent's expense), which policy or
policies provide the DandO Indemnitees with the coverage described in the
preceding sentence for an aggregate period of not less than six years with
respect to claims arising from acts, events or omissions that occurred at or
prior to the Closing, including with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an aggregate annual premium for
such coverage in excess of 250% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by
the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual
premium equal to or less than such maximum amount, Parent shall (or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) obtain that amount of insurance (or "tail
coverage") obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 8.02. The provisions of this Section 8.02 are intended for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former officer,
manager or similar functionary of the Company or its Subsidiaries and his or
her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have had by contract or otherwise.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its directors or officers, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
8.02 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

8.03 Regulatory Filings. Parent shall, within ten Business Days after the date
hereof, (i) make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under the HSR
Act in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein and (ii) provide or cause to be provided the notices set forth on the
attached Parent Notices Schedule. In connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, Parent shall promptly comply with any
additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Entities. In addition, Parent shall cooperate in good faith with
any Governmental Entities and undertake promptly any and all action required
(including divestitures of its assets) to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement expeditiously and lawfully. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if a suit or other action is threatened or
instituted by any Governmental Entity or any other entity challenging the
validity or legality or seeking to restrain the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, Bank and Merger Sub shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid, resist, resolve or, if
necessary, defend such suit or action. In addition to the foregoing, Parent,
Bank and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any governmental or third party consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals
which may be required to be obtained by Parent, Bank or Merger Sub and are set
forth on Schedule 3.01(e) hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and to consummate such transactions as promptly as
practicable. Parent, Bank and Merger Sub shall diligently assist and cooperate
with the Company in preparing and filing all documents required to be
submitted by the Company or its Affiliates to any Governmental Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and in obtaining any
governmental or third party consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals
which may be required to be obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (which assistance and
cooperation shall include timely furnishing to the Company all information
concerning Parent and/or its Affiliates that counsel to the Company reasonably
determines is required to be included in such documents or would be helpful in
obtaining such required consent, waiver, authorization or approval). Parent
shall be responsible for all filing fees under the HSR Act and under any such
other Laws applicable to Parent, Bank and Merger Sub. Parent shall request and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act.

8.04 Conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Parent,
Bank and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set
forth in Article III).

8.05 Contact with Customers and Suppliers, etc. Prior to the Closing, Parent,
Bank, Merger Sub and the Parent's Representative may only contact and
communicate with the employees, customers, service providers, applicable
regulatory bodies and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby after prior consultation
with and written approval of the Company's Chief Executive Officer.

8.06 Designated Event. Prior to the Closing, or, if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent due to the failure of the condition set forth in Section
3.01(h), following such termination, (other than prior to the Closing and
before a termination of this Agreement with respect to the entry into the
Employment Agreements) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, hire, engage or pay compensation or benefits of
any kind to or for the benefit of any Designated Executive. Prior to the
occurrence of a Designated Event with respect to any Designated Executive,
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, manifestly repudiate
the Employment Agreement with respect to such Designated Executive.

is Parent, neither Parent, Bank nor Merger Sub shall have) breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall
have proximately caused the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Outside Date; provided that if
any party brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other party (or seeks any other remedy

ARTICLE XI 

INDEMNIFICATION

11.01 Indemnification. After the Closing, Stockholder shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, each of Parent, Bank and their officers, directors,
affiliates (including, after the Closing, Company and its Subsidiaries) and
representatives (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties"; provided,
however, that "Parent Indemnified Parties" shall not include any Member of
Stockholder) from and against all Losses incurred or suffered by any Parent
Indemnified Party resulting from any such breach or inaccuracy as of the
Closing Date (as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the
extent otherwise provided in this Agreement and, with respect to
representations and warranties that are expressly made as of an earlier date,
as of such date) of any representation or warranty contained in Article VI;
provided that to the extent the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
recovery for such matter under the terms of the insurance policy described on
Annex A, if the applicable retention amount is satisfied by Stockholder then
any amounts actually received by the Parent Indemnified Parties under such
insurance policy in respect of such claims shall be senior in priority (i.e.,
Losses of Parent Indemnified Parties will be satisfied first out of such
amounts actually received under such insurance policy and second from
Stockholder) to any recovery from Stockholder (provided that Stockholder shall
remain liable, and shall pay, any amounts (i) in excess of the amounts
actually received by the Parent Indemnified Parties under such policy or (ii)
which are not payable under such Policy by reason of the retention amount
thereunder, in the case of each of (i) and (ii) only to the extent of
Stockholder's obligations under this Article XI). Stockholder shall not be
liable for any claim for indemnification under this Section 11.01 unless
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claim for
indemnification is delivered by the Person seeking indemnification to
Stockholder prior to the expiration of the survival period specified in
Section 11.02, in which case the representation or warranty which is the
subject of such claim shall survive, to the extent of such claim and other
claims arising from the same facts and circumstances only, until such claim is
resolved, whether or not the amount of the Losses resulting from such breach
has been finally determined at the time the notice is given. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate amount payable by
Stockholder hereunder shall in no event exceed the net cash proceeds actually
received by Stockholder in respect of the Merger Consideration.

11.02 Survival. The representations and warranties of Stockholder in Article
VI shall survive the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing Date.
All covenants and agreements that are to be performed by any party following
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance
with their terms. All other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the
Closing.

11.03 Tax Matters. Any indemnity payments made under this Agreement will be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes unless
otherwise required by Law.

11.04 No Waiver. The representations and warranties of Stockholder, and
Parent's and the Bank's rights to indemnification with respect thereto
pursuant to Article XI, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of
any investigation made by or on behalf of Parent or the Bank (including by any
of their Representatives) or by reason of the fact that Parent, Bank or any of
such Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might have been inaccurate.

11.05 Procedure with Respect to Third-Party Claims.

(a) If any Parent Indemnified Party becomes subject to a pending or threatened
claim of a Third Party (a "Third-Party Claim") and Parent or Bank believes it
has a claim against Stockholder as a result, then Parent or Bank, as
applicable, shall reasonably promptly notify Stockholder in writing of the
basis for such claim setting forth the nature of the claim in reasonable
detail. The failure of Parent and/or Bank to so notify Stockholder shall not
relieve Stockholder of liability hereunder except to the extent that the
defense of such claim is materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of
substantive rights or defenses by the failure to give such notice.

(b) Stockholder will have the right to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of the Third-Party Claim (at the expense of Stockholder) if (i)
Stockholder provides written notice to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party
that Stockholder intends to undertake such defense, (ii) Stockholder
diligently conducts such defense with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party and (iii) Stockholder posts or otherwise
satisfies in full any bonds required to be posted in connection with such
Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that Stockholder shall permit the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party to participate in such defense or
settlement through counsel chosen by such Parent Indemnified Party (the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Parent Indemnified Party
unless, in the opinion of counsel, representation of both Stockholder and the
Parent Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional care due to action or potential differing
interests between such parties, in which case the fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Parent Indemnified Party (including one appropriate local
counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) shall be borne by Stockholder). If
Stockholder assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by Stockholder without
the applicable Parent Indemnified Party's consent unless (i) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any Person and no adverse affect on any other Third-Party Claims that may be
made against the Parent Indemnified Parties and (ii) the sole relief provided
is monetary damages that are paid in full by Stockholder.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 11.05(b), if (i) notice is given to Stockholder of
the commencement of any Third-Party Claim and Stockholder does not, within 30
days after the Parent Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the
Parent Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such legal
proceeding, (ii) any of the conditions set forth in clause (ii) of Section
11.05(b) above become unsatisfied, or (iii) a Third-Party Claim seeks
primarily specific performance or other non-monetary relief that will
adversely affect one or more Parent Indemnified Parties or involves criminal
allegations, then the Parent Indemnified Party shall (upon notice to
Stockholder) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of such claim and in such case, Stockholder shall reimburse the applicable
Parent Indemnified Party for the costs of defending against such Third-Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and shall remain
otherwise responsible for any liability with respect to amounts arising from
or related to such Third-Party Claim, to the extent it is ultimately
determined that Stockholder is liable with respect to such Third-Party Claim
under this Article XI, in each case subject to the limitations provided in
this Article XI. Stockholder may elect to participate in such legal
proceedings, negotiations or defense at any time at its own expense.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 11.05, in no event will any
Parent Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into
any settlement with respect to a Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of Stockholder (not to be unreasonably withheld).

11.06 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, the indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 11.01 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
and recourse of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses or other
claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby with respect to Stockholder, the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates. In furtherance of the
foregoing, except as expressly provided in the indemnification provisions set
forth in Section 11.01, each Parent Indemnified Party hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than any right, claim or
cause of action arising out of actual fraud) it may have against Stockholder,
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective affiliates relating
to the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedules and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether
arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law,
ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (excluding actual fraud, but
including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse
or remedy, including as may arise under common law).

ARTICLE XII 

GENERAL

12.01 Disclosure Schedules. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto (each, a
"Schedule" and, collectively, the "Disclosure Schedules") are incorporated
herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though completely set
forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any of the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement,
including all Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately titled sections
corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; however, each section of the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules.
Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined
therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.

12.02 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. It is acknowledged by each of
the parties hereto that each of the Company and Stockholder have retained
Kirkland and Ellis LLP ("KandE") to act as its counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that KandE has not acted as counsel for any
other party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a client of KandE for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Parent, the
Company and Stockholder hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Parent and/or the Company, on the one hand, and
Stockholder or its Affiliates, on the other hand, no party to this Agreement
will take any action to attempt to disqualify KandE from representing
Stockholder and/or such Affiliates in connection with any such dispute based
on KandE's representation of Stockholder and the Company in connection therewith
on or prior to the Closing. Parent further agrees that, as to all
communications among KandE, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Stockholder
and/or any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to Stockholder and may be
controlled by Stockholder and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of
their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by KandE to such third party; provided, however,
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of Stockholder.

12.03 Acknowledgment of Parent and Merger Sub

12.04 Press Releases and Communications. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the

required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in which case Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review such press release,
announcement or communication prior to issuance, distribution or publication;
provided, however, that the Company and Parent may issue a press release in
connection with the signing of this Agreement in a form previously agreed upon
by the Company and Parent without the consent of the other party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Institutional Investors and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) may
provide general information about the subject matter of this Agreement in
connection with their respective fund raising, marketing, informational or
reporting activities.

12.05 Certain Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

Company, Parent, Bank and Merger Sub shall pay all of their own fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants; provided, that (a) in the event
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, Parent

12.08 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by either Parent, Bank or Merger Sub without the prior
written consent of the Company and Stockholder, or by the Company or
Stockholder without the prior written consent of Parent.

12.09 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

12.10 References. The table of contents and the section and other headings and
subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto,
and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or
"Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to
this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring to
this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or any variation thereof
means "including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

12.11 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any
information set forth in any Schedule or incorporated in any Section of the
Agreement shall be considered to have been set forth in each other Schedule
and shall be deemed to modify the representations and warranties in Article IV
whether or not such representations and warranties refer to such Schedule. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or
outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of
the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is
or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the ordinary of business for purposes of this Agreement. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of
Law or breach of contract).

12.12 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by Parent, Bank, Merger Sub, the Company and Stockholder. No waiver of any
provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect
in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

12.13 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement)
contain the complete agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

12.14 Thirdâ€‘Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and Stockholder
any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Section 8.02 shall be enforceable by the current and former officers,
directors and similar functionaries of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and
his or her heirs and representatives, (ii) the last sentence in Section 12.04
is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, any Institutional
Investor and its Affiliates, (iii) Section 12.21 is intended for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Non-Recourse Party of a party to this
Agreement; provided, however, that only Stockholder shall have a right to
enforce such rights on any such Non-Recourse Party's behalf and (iv) the
provisions of Article XI are intended for the benefit of the Parent
Indemnified Parties, and shall be enforceable by Parent on behalf of the
Parent Indemnified Parties. In addition, prior to the Closing, Stockholder
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce any rights of the
Company or Stockholder under this Agreement.

12.15 Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE
OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES
TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

12.16 Parent Deliveries. Parent agrees and acknowledges that all documents or
other items delivered or made available to Parent's Representative shall be
deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case may be, to Parent for
purposes of the representations and warranties of, and the closing deliveries
contemplated to be delivered by, the Company and Stockholder hereunder.

12.17 Delivery by Facsimile. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered
into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments or
waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

12.18 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

12.19 Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits
and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

12.20 Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or any other court of the State of Delaware, and each of the
parties hereto hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.07
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

12.21 No Recourse. Except as may be expressly provided in this Agreement, any
Limited Guaranty executed in connection with this Agreement or the Restricted
Covenant Agreement, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-Recourse
Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein.

12.22 Specific Performance.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other party's
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any action, claim, complaint or
other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding.
