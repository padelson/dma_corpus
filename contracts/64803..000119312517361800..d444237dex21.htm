(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of the Company
Common Stock:

(i) other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)(ii)_ (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.8378 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Share Consideration_ ") and (ii) $145.00 in cash without interest thereon
(the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Share Consideration, the
" _Merger Consideration_ ");

 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any such shares owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of
other Persons, whether or not held in a separate account) shall be cancelled,
and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto;

(iii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "); and

 

(iv) all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and (x) each share of Company Common Stock that was immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented by a certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and (y) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock
(an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company shall
(other than with respect to Excluded Shares) thereafter represent only the
right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) with respect to the
Share Consideration, the right to receive (1) any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(f)_ and (2) any cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.08_, in each case to be issued or paid in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
2.04_, without interest.

 



18 Section 2.04. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") for the purpose
of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock. As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ through the Exchange Agent, (x)
certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.03(a)(i)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (y)
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)(i)_. Parent agrees to make available, directly or
indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash
and/or shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay any dividends or
other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.04(f)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.08_. Promptly
after the Effective Time (and in no event more than two (2) Business Days
following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to
the Effective Time and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange. All certificates (or evidence of shares in book-
entry form) and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Exchange Fund_." Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article_ __
_ II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such cash shall only be
invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional
interests; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent necessary to pay the
Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause to be provided additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the property of, and paid to, Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a

 



19  book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in respect of each share of
the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect
to the Share Consideration as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(f)_. The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part
of such Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends and distributions
with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.08_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(f)_) is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

(d) Upon the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share
Consideration as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ and  _Section_ __ _
2.04(f)_) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in,
or as otherwise contemplated by, this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share
Consideration as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ and _Section_ __ _
2.04(f)_), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



20 (f) Following the surrender of any Certificates or the transfer of
any Uncertificated Shares as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name
the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Share Consideration have
been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Share
Consideration, (x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
to which such Person is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_, and (y)
the aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after
the Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such surrender or
transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the payment of the
Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the
Share Consideration with a record date on or after the Effective Time and
prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the
Share Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not
surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

 

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the
sole responsibility of such holder.

Section 2.05. _No Dissenters Rights_. In accordance with Section 1571(b)
of Pennsylvania Law, the Merger will not entitle any holder of Company Common
Stock to any dissenters rights.

 

Section 2.06. _Company Equity Awards_ _; Company ESPP_

 

(a) _Company Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each
restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that (x) vests solely based on the
passage of time (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") and (y) pursuant to its
terms as in effect as of the date hereof, provides for automatic accelerated
vesting upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the restrictions and vesting conditions applicable to such Company
RSU Award shall lapse and each such Company RSU Award shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, with respect to each share
of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU Award, the Merger
Consideration, less applicable Tax withholdings, which shall be paid or
provided by Parent as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 



21 (ii) With respect to each Company RSU Award that (x) is not converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.06(a)(i)_ or (y) is granted after the date hereof to the extent permitted
under  _Section_ __ _ 6.01(d)_, at the Effective Time, such Company RSU
Award shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of
the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a
restricted unit award (each, an " _Assumed Restricted Unit Award_ "), except
that each Assumed Restricted Unit Award shall cover that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time _multiplied_ by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the
result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock. Except as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)(ii)_, each Assumed
Restricted Unit Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any terms and conditions
relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holders employment
in connection with or following the Merger).

 

(b) _Company Performance Stock Units_.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each stock
unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under
any Company Stock Plan that (x) vests based on the achievement of performance
goals (each, a " _Company PSU Award_ ") and (y) pursuant to its terms as in
effect as of the date hereof, provides for automatic accelerated vesting upon
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
restrictions and vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award shall
lapse and each such Company PSU Award shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company PSU Award (determined assuming
the achievement of target level performance), the Merger Consideration, less
applicable Tax withholdings, which shall be paid or provided by Parent as soon
as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days following the Closing Date.

(ii) With respect to each Company PSU Award that (x) is not converted into
a right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.06(b)(i)_ or (y) is granted after the date hereof to the extent permitted
under  _Section_ __ _ 6.01(d)_, at the Effective Time, such Company PSU
Award shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of
the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a time-
vesting restricted unit award (each, an " _Assumed Performance Unit Award_
"), except that each Assumed Performance Unit Award shall cover that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company PSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time (determined in accordance with the applicable
award agreement) _multiplied_ by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the
result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock. Except as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(b)(ii)_, each Assumed
Performance Unit Award shall

 



22  continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated
vesting upon a termination of the holders employment in connection with or
following the Merger).

 

(c) _Company Stock Appreciation Rights_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right representing the
right to receive a payment in shares of Company Common Stock under any
Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Stock Appreciation Right_ ") that is
vested or that, pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof,
would become vested as of the Effective Time, with a per share exercise price
less than the Equity Award Cash Consideration, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the sum of (x) the Cash
Consideration _plus_ (y) the value equal to the product of the Parent Stock
Price _multiplied_ by the Exchange Ratio (the sum of the amounts in clauses
(x) and (y), the " _Equity Award Cash Consideration_ ") over (2) the
applicable per share exercise price of such Company Stock Appreciation Right
_multiplied_ by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Appreciation Right. At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Appreciation Right that is vested or that, pursuant to its terms
as in effect as of the date hereof, would become vested as of the Effective
Time, with a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the Equity
Award Cash Consideration, shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 

(ii) Each Company Stock Appreciation Right that (x) is not cancelled in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.06(c)(i)_ or (y) is granted after the date
hereof to the extent permitted under _Section_ __ _ 6.01(d)_, at the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on
the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and become, as of the
Effective Time, a stock appreciation right (an " _Assumed Stock Appreciation
Right_ ") representing the right to receive a payment in shares of Parent
Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting,
exercise and expiration provisions) as applied to each such Company Stock
Appreciation Right immediately prior to the Effective Time, shares of Parent
Common Stock, except that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, subject to such Assumed Stock
Appreciation Right shall equal the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Stock Appreciation
Right immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_ by (y) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, and (B) the per share exercise price, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent, shall equal the quotient of (1) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Appreciation Right
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (2) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Aetna Inc.
2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") that are necessary
to provide that: (i) with respect to

 



23  the offering period for which participant payroll deductions commence during
December 2017 (the " _Company ESPP Offering Period_ "), (A) no participant may
elect to participate in the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement,
(B) no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll
deduction election from that in effect on the date of this Agreement for such
Company ESPP Offering Period; and (C) such Company ESPP Offering Period shall
terminate at the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Company
ESPP Offering Period and (y) immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii)
each participants accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company
ESPP on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Company ESPP

additional offering periods shall commence thereafter; and (iv) subject to the
consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective at the

Date), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) with respect to the issuance of the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the Assumed Restricted Unit Awards, Assumed Performance Unit
Awards and Assumed Stock Appreciation Rights and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed Restricted Unit
Awards, Assumed Performance Unit Awards and Assumed Stock Appreciation Rights
remain outstanding.

 

(f) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company (and/or the compensation committee (or equivalent committee)
of the Board of Directors of the Company) and the Board of Directors of Parent
(and/or the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Board of
Directors of Parent) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_.

 

Section 2.07. _Adjustments_. Without limiting or affecting any of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, if, during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent
shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger
Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.08. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and, if a fractional
share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive,
in lieu thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined by
multiplying the Parent Stock Price by the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

 



24 Section 2.09. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal, state,
local or non-U.S. Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds and pays over all amounts so
withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under
Applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all

insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such
risks as the Company reasonably believes, based on past experience, is
adequate for the businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(taking into account the cost and availability of such insurance). Except as
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company Insurance
Policies (i) are sufficient for compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with all Company Material Contracts and (ii) will not terminate or lapse by
their terms by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Section 4.25 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year ending prior to
the date of this Agreement for the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies.

have been no transactions, or series of related transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings in effect, nor are there any currently proposed
transactions, or series of related transactions, 

 



44  agreements, arrangements or understandings, that would be required to be
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K that have not been otherwise
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof.

Section 4.27. _Antitakeover Statutes_. Assuming the representation and
warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ is true and correct, neither the
restrictions set forth in Subchapter F of Chapter 25 of Pennsylvania Law nor
any other "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other
antitakeover laws enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.28. _Opinions of Financial Advisor_ _s_. The Board of Directors
of the Company has received the separate opinions of each of Lazard Freres and
Co. LLC and Allen and Company LLC, financial advisors to the Company, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the
various assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.

 

Section 4.29. _Finders_ __ _Fees_. Except for Lazard Freres and Co.
LLC, Allen and Company LLC and Evercore Group L.L.C., a copy of each of whose
engagement agreements has been provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary
that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from
the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.30. _No Ownership of Parent Common Stock_. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, any
shares of Parent Common Stock or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any rights to acquire any shares
of Parent Common Stock (other than any such securities owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on
behalf of other Persons, whether or not held in a separate account). There
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
the capital stock or other equity interest of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.31. _No Other Company Representations and Warranties_. Except
for the representations and warranties made by the Company in this _Article_
__ _ IV_ (as qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.05_ and the
introduction to this  _Article_ __ _ IV_), neither the Company nor any other
Person makes or has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied,
at law or in equity, with respect to or on behalf of the Company or its

information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other

 



45  matter furnished or provided to Parent or made available to Parent in any
"data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other
form in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its Subsidiaries disclaim
any other representations or warranties, whether made by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives.

(as qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.05_ and the introduction to

adequacy or sufficiency of reserves on any line item, asset, liability or
equity amount on any financial or other document, (c) whether or not reserves
were determined in accordance with any actuarial, statutory, regulatory or
other standard, or (d) the collectability of any amounts under any
reinsurance Contract. The Company acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent in _Article_ __ _ V_ (as
qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Schedule
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.05_ and the introduction to _Article_ __
_ V_), neither Parent nor any other Person is making or has made any
representations or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity, with
respect to or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries, their businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Parent or its
Subsidiaries or any other matter furnished or provided to Parent or made
available to the Company in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Company specifically disclaims that it is relying upon or has relied upon any
such other representations or warranties that may have been made by any
Person, and acknowledges and agrees that Parent and its Affiliates have
specifically disclaimed and do hereby specifically disclaim any such other
representations and warranties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_
__ _ 4.31_ shall not limit Parents, Merger Subs or the Companys remedies

Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.05_, except (i) other than with respect to the
representations and warranties in  _Section_ __ _ 5.01_, _Section_ __ _
5.02_, _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, _Section_ __ _ 5.20_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.21_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.22_, as disclosed in any
publicly available Parent SEC Document filed after December 31, 2016 and
before the date of this Agreement or in Parents annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 or in Parents proxy statement for
the 2016 annual meeting of Parents stockholders or (ii) as set forth in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent represents and warrants to the Company
that:

Section 5.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. Parent is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and

 



46  Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated and validly subsisting under

assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, Parent indirectly owns all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub. Prior to the date of

Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Parent Share Issuance_ ") is the
only vote of the holders of any of Parents capital stock necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Merger (the " _Parent Stockholder
Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent
and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with
its terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions).

unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement and the

adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Parent Share Issuance), (iii) directing

subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn any of the foregoing
resolutions.

 

Section 5.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no action by or in respect of, Consents of, or Filing with, any
Governmental Authority other than (i) the filing of the Statement of Merger
with the Pennsylvania Department of State and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of other states in which Parent or Merger Sub is
qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of
the HSR Act, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities
laws or pursuant to the rules of the NYSE, (iv) Consents of, and
Filings with, the state insurance departments, federal and state departments
of health and other Consents and Filings required under the Health Care Laws,
Government Sponsored Health Care Programs or Insurance Laws that are listed on

Consents or Filings the absence of which has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Parent Organizational Documents, (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ and receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Approval, contravene, conflict with or result in any
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ and receipt
of the Parent Stockholder Approval, require any Consent or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or
permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under, any provision of any Contract binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any governmental Consents (including
Consents required by Contract) affecting, or relating in any way to, the
assets or business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the

duly authorized and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, will have been validly issued and will be fully paid and
nonassessable and the issuance thereof will be free of preemptive right.
Parent directly or indirectly owns all of the issued and outstanding capital

Agreement (assuming, in the case of each of the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, that the representation and warranty set

made known to Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being

alerting Parents principal executive officer and principal financial officer
to material information required to be included in Parents periodic and
current reports required under the 1934 Act.

 

(f) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal controls. Such internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting
and the preparation of Parents financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parents principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors

employees who have a significant role in internal controls. Parent has made

Section 5.24. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of a
fully executed commitment letter from the Financing Sources (including all
exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such letters as and to the extent
delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
provide the debt financing described therein in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Debt Commitment Letter and any other
debt commitment letter (including any replacement of the Debt Commitment
Letter in connection with any Alternative Financing) executed in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.06_, as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or
waived in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.06_, including all exhibits,
schedules, and annexes to such letters, are hereinafter referred to together
as the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ ". The financing contemplated pursuant
to the Debt Commitment Letters is hereinafter referred to as the " _Debt
Financing_ ".

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters are in
full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent,
and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms against Parent, and to the knowledge
of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exceptions. All commitment fees required to be paid under the Debt
Commitment Letters have been paid in full or will be duly paid in full as and
when due, and Parent and Merger Sub have otherwise satisfied all of the other
items and conditions required to be satisfied by them, and within their
control, pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to
the date of this Agreement. None of the Debt Commitment Letters have

 



60  been amended, modified or terminated on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, and no Debt Commitment Letter will be amended, modified or
terminated by Parent or Merger Sub except as consistent with _Section_ __ _
7.06_. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by Parent or Merger Sub under any Debt
Commitment Letter. None of Parent or Merger Sub is, as of the date of this
Agreement, aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of
the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in any
Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate (assuming the accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement) in any material
respect, that would cause the commitments provided in the Debt Commitment
Letter to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained
therein not to be met. The consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no
conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the copies of
the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to the Company, and there are no
contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce the total
amount of the Debt Financing other than those expressly set forth in the
copies of the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to the Company. Except for fee
letters relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (redacted copies
of which, removing only fee amounts, market "flex" provisions and
certain other terms (none of which would adversely affect the amounts,
availability, timing or conditionality of the Debt Financing), have been
provided to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement) and any
engagement letters or fee discount letters related to the permanent financing
referred to in the Debt Commitment Letters, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates are a party related to the funding of the Debt
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the
date of this Agreement, assuming no breach by the Company of
its representations and warranties under this Agreement (and cooperation and
assistance by the Company as required by the terms of this Agreement) and no
breach or default by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement (in
either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ would fail to be satisfied), and based upon facts and
events known by Parent as of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent or
Merger Sub have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be
available to Parent or Merger Sub as contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letters on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Debt Commitment Letters, the aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing,
together with cash or cash equivalents held by Parent and the other sources of
funds referenced in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to
the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the Effective
Time, will be sufficient to enable Parent to pay in cash all amounts required
to be paid by it in cash in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses
payable by it related to or arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.25. _No Other Parent Representations and Warranties_. Except for
the representations and warranties made by Parent in this _Article_ __ _ V_
(as qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.05_ and the introduction to
this  _Article_ __ _ V_), neither Parent nor any other Person makes or has
made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in
equity, with respect to or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries, their
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, financial

 



61  condition, results of operations, future operating or financial results,
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding Parent or its Subsidiaries or any other matter furnished
or provided to the Company or made available to the Company in any "data
rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and its Subsidiaries disclaim any
other representations or warranties, whether made by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the representations and
warranties made by Parent in this _Article_ __ _ V_ (as qualified by the
applicable items disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Schedule in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 11.05_ and the introduction to this  _Article_ __ _
V_), neither Parent nor any other Person makes or has made any representation
or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to or on
behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries with respect to (a) the adequacy or
sufficiency of reserves, (b) the effect of the adequacy or sufficiency of
reserves on any line item, asset, liability or equity amount on any financial
or other document, (c) whether or not reserves were determined in accordance
with any actuarial, statutory, regulatory or other standard, or (d) the
collectability of any amounts under any reinsurance Contract. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
made by the Company in _Article_ __ _ IV_ (as qualified by the applicable
items disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 11.05_ and the introduction to  _Article_ __ _ IV_), neither
the Company nor any other Person is making or has made any representations or
warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, future
operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries
or any other matter furnished or provided to Parent or made available to
Parent in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or
in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Parent specifically disclaims
that it is relying upon or has relied upon any such other representations or
warranties that may have been made by any Person, and acknowledges and agrees
that the Company and its Affiliates have specifically disclaimed and do hereby
specifically disclaim any such other representations and warranties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 5.25_ shall not limit
Parents, Merger Subs or the Companys remedies in the case of fraud.

Section 6.02. _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries

Third Party or any Company Acquisition Proposal or (v) fail to enforce or
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of 

 



67  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless the Board of Directors of the
Company determines after consulting with its outside legal counsel that the
failure to waive such provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law ( _provided_ that the obligation not to fail to
enforce any such standstill or similar agreement under this _Section_ __ _
6.02(a)(v)_ shall apply with respect to known breaches of such agreements
only).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt
of the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Approval Time_ ") (and in
no event after the Company Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the
Company receives a _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal made after
the date hereof which has not resulted from a violation of this _Section_ __
_ 6.02_, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (x) contact the Third Party that has made
such Company Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify
terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of the Company informing
itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (y)
subject to compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_, _Section_ __ _
6.02(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_, (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the Companys compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_, has made after the date of this Agreement a
Company Superior Proposal or an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (ii)
furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing
sources nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to (x) a confidentiality agreement between the Company
and such Third Party in existence on or prior to the date hereof or (y) a
confidentiality agreement with confidentiality terms in the aggregate no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after its execution, to
Parent for informational purposes;  _provided_ that all such non-public
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent,
as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided
or made available to such Third Party, and (iii) following receipt of a
Company Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (A) make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01(d)(v)_, but in each case referred to in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board
of Directors of the Company from (x) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action
taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this _Section_ __ _
6.02_; or (y) making any required disclosure to the shareholders of the
Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law;
_provided_ that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or
relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal may only be made in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_
and  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and
listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act shall not be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 



68 (c) In addition to the requirements set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.02(b)_, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_
unless the Company shall have first delivered to Parent written notice
advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action, and the Company
shall continue to advise Parent, on a current basis, after taking such action
of the status and material terms of any discussions and negotiations with the
applicable Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly
(but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal,
any indication that a Third Party is considering making a Company Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to
the knowledge of the Company or any member of its Board of Directors, is
considering making, is reasonably likely to make or has made, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall
identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any
such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any
material changes thereto). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis, of the status and details of any such Company Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request (including any changes thereto) and shall
promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt) provide to Parent copies of all material correspondence and written
materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
describes any terms or conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal (as well
as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such
matters).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no event after the Company
Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening
Event if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law;  _provided_ that (i) the Company shall (A)
promptly notify Parent in writing of its intention to take such action and (B)
negotiate in good faith with Parent for three (3) Business Days following such
notice regarding revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent,
and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening
Event unless, after the three (3) Business Day period described in the
foregoing clause (B), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(e) Without limiting or affecting  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_, _Section_ __
_ 6.02(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating
to a Company Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal unless
(i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three (3)
Business Days before taking such action, that the Company intends to take
such action, which notice attaches the most current version of any proposed
agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms of such Company Superior
Proposal and the identity of the offeror, (ii) if

 



69  requested by Parent, during such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
and its Representatives have discussed and negotiated in good faith with
Parent regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement
in response to such Company Superior Proposal and (iii) after such three (3)
Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that in the event of
any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of any such
Company Superior Proposal, a new written notification from the Company
consistent with that described in clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_
shall be required, and a new notice period under clause (i) of this _Section_
__ _ 6.02(e)_ shall commence, during which notice period the Company shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_
anew, except that such new notice period shall be for two (2) Business Days
(as opposed to three (3) Business Days)). After delivery of such written
notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall
promptly keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting the
material terms of any such Company Superior Proposal (and the Company shall
provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received that
relate to such Company Superior Proposal).

 

(f) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company Acquisition Proposal which has
resulted from a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_) (with all references
to "20%" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal being deemed to be
references to "50%") on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
considers to be appropriate (including the identity of the Person making the
Company Acquisition Proposal and the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements (including
divestitures and entry into other commitments and limitations), break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and availability
of necessary financing), would result in a transaction (i) that, if
consummated, is more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the
Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal, any approval requirements and
all other financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed in a manner comparable
to Parents and Merger Subs financing (or which is reasonably determined to
be available by the Board of Directors of the Company).

(g) " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any material event, change,
effect, development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case
to the Board of Directors or executive officers of the Company as of or prior
to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (A) in no event shall any
action taken by either party pursuant to the affirmative covenants set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.02_, or the consequences of any such action, constitute,
be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in

 



70  determining whether there has been a Company Intervening Event, and (B) in
no event shall any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that would
fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" constitute, be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken
into account in determining whether there has been a Company Intervening
Event.

 

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Company to return or destroy all such information.

(i) Notwithstanding (i) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii)
the making of any Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, until termination of this Agreement (x) in no event
may the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar instrument constituting or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement), (B) except as required by
Applicable Law or permitted pursuant to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _

Acquisition Proposal or (C) seek any Consents in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) the
Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries to use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to provide

its Subsidiaries). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,

foregoing, (1) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur prior to the

this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ (other than the use of any information provided by

Representatives in writing for use in connection with the Debt Financing),
except in the event such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
reasonable attorneys fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in

any such notice, announcement, certificate or legal opinion, in each case
before such document is provided to such a trustee, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its

initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the
submission of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,

knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort by, any Third Party
that Parent knows is seeking to make, or has made, a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) (A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify
in any manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation, (B)
fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose to

foregoing in this clause (iii), a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
(iv) take any action to make any "moratorium," "control share

laws and regulations of the State of Delaware, including Section 203 of
Delaware Law, inapplicable to any Third Party or any Parent Acquisition

this Agreement) under, or any Person becoming a "Related Person" under,
the Fifth Article of the certificate of incorporation of Parent as in effect
on the date hereof, (vi) take any action to make any other antitakeover
provision in the certificate of incorporation of Parent inapplicable to any
Third Party or any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (vii) fail to enforce or
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
unless the Board of Directors of Parent determines after consulting with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to waive such provision would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law ( _provided_ that
the obligation not to fail to enforce any such standstill or similar
agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)(vii)_ shall apply with respect to
known breaches of such agreements only).

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt of
the Parent Stockholder Approval (the " _Parent Approval Time_ ") (and in no
event after the Parent

 



76  Approval Time), the Board of Directors of Parent receives a _bona fide_
written Parent Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof which has not
resulted from a violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, the Board of
Directors of Parent, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may
(x) contact the Third Party that has made such Parent Acquisition Proposal in
order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board
of Directors of Parent informing itself about such Parent Acquisition Proposal
and such Third Party and (y) subject to compliance with this _Section_ __ _
7.02(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.02(e)_, (i) engage
in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to Parents
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, has made after the date of this
Agreement a Parent Superior Proposal or an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal,
(ii) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources
nonpublic information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to (x) a confidentiality agreement between Parent and such Third
Party in existence on or prior to the date hereof or (y) a confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality terms in the aggregate no less favorable to
Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which
shall be provided, promptly after its execution, to the Company for
informational purposes; _provided_ that all such non-public information
(to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to the Company) is provided or made available to the Company, as the
case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made
available to such Third Party and (iii) following receipt of a Parent
Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (A) make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement providing for such Parent Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01(c)(iv)_, but in each case referred to in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
of Parent from (x) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard
to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_; or (y)
making any required disclosure to the stockholders of Parent if the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law; _provided_ that any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal may only be made in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.02(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen" disclosure
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
1934 Act shall not be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_,
the Board of Directors of Parent shall not take any of the actions referred
to in clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_ unless Parent
shall have first delivered to the Company written notice advising the Company
that Parent intends to take such action, and Parent shall continue to advise
the Company, on a current basis, after taking such action of the status and
material terms of any discussions and negotiations with the applicable Third
Party. In addition, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Parent (or any of its
Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a
Third Party 

 



77  is considering making a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of Parent or any member
of its Board of Directors, is considering making, is reasonably likely to make
or has made, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Parent Acquisition Proposal, indication or request
(including any material changes thereto). Parent shall keep the Company fully
informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any changes thereto)
and shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt) provide to the Company copies of all material correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that
describes any terms or conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal (as well
as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such
matters).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Parent Approval Time (and in no event after the Parent
Approval Time), the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event if
the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law;  _provided_ that (i) Parent shall (A) promptly notify the
Company in writing of its intention to take such action and (B) negotiate in
good faith with the Company for three (3) Business Days following such notice
regarding revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company,
and (ii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall not effect any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event
unless, after the three (3) Business Day period described in the foregoing
clause (B), the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

(e) Without limiting or affecting  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, _Section_ __
_ 7.02(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall not make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to
a Parent Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement in order to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Parent Superior Proposal unless (i)
Parent promptly notifies the Company, in writing at least three (3) Business
Days before taking such action, that Parent intends to take such action,
which notice attaches the most current version of any proposed agreement or a
detailed summary of all material terms of such Parent Superior Proposal and
the identity of the offeror, (ii) if requested by the Company, during such
three (3) Business Day period, Parent and its Representatives have discussed
and negotiated in good faith with the Company regarding any proposal by the
Company to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Parent
Superior Proposal and (iii) after such three (3) Business Day period, the
Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, taking into account any
proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement, that such
Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that in the event of any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of any such Parent Superior Proposal,
a new written notification from Parent consistent with that described in
clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(e)_ shall be required, and a new
notice period under clause (i) of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(e)_ shall
commence, during which notice period Parent shall be

 



78  required to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(e)_
anew, except that such new notice period shall be for two (2) Business Days
(as opposed to three (3) Business Days)). After delivery of such written
notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall promptly
keep the Company informed of all material developments affecting the material
terms of any such Parent Superior Proposal (and Parent shall provide the
Company with copies of any additional written materials received that relate
to such Parent Superior Proposal).

 

(f) " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written Parent
Acquisition Proposal (other than a Parent Acquisition Proposal which has
resulted from a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_) (with all references
to "20%" in the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal being deemed to be
references to "50%") on terms that the Board of Directors of Parent
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent
considers to be appropriate (including the identity of the Person making the
Parent Acquisition Proposal and the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements (including
divestitures and entry into other commitments and limitations), break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and availability
of necessary financing), would result in a transaction (i) that, if
consummated, is more favorable to Parents stockholders from a financial point
of view than the Merger (taking into account any proposal by the Company to
amend the terms of this Agreement), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the
Person making the Parent Acquisition Proposal, any approval requirements and
all other financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed in a manner comparable
to Parents and Merger Subs financing (or which is reasonably determined to
be available by the Board of Directors of Parent).

(g) " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means any material event, change,
effect, development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case
to the Board of Directors or executive officers of Parent as of or prior to
the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (A) in no event shall any action taken
by either party pursuant to the affirmative covenants set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.02_, or the consequences of any such action, constitute, be deemed to
contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a Parent Intervening Event, and (B) in no event shall any event,
change, effect, development or occurrence that would fall within any of the
exceptions to the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" constitute,
be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event.

 

(h) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Parent
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about Parent that was furnished by or on behalf of Parent to
return or destroy all such information.

 



79 (i) Notwithstanding (i) any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the
making of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, until termination of this Agreement (x) in no event may
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter into any agreement in principle,
letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument constituting or relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement), (B) except as required by Applicable Law
or permitted pursuant to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, make,
facilitate or provide information in connection with any SEC or other Filings
in connection with the transactions contemplated by any Parent Acquisition
Proposal or (C) seek any Consents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by any Parent Acquisition Proposal and (y) Parent shall otherwise
remain subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 7.03. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Until the Effective Time,
Parent shall at all times be the direct or indirect owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall cause the sole shareholder of Merger Sub to execute and deliver a
written consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with Pennsylvania Law
and provide copies of such written consent to the Company.

 

Section 7.04. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer or
employee may have under any indemnification agreement or under the Company
Organizational Documents or similar organizational documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or any applicable Subsidiary thereof (collectively,
the " _D andO Indemnifying Parties_"), to the fullest extent each such DandO
Indemnifying Party is so authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is
at the date hereof, was previously or during the period from the date hereof
through the date of the Effective Time will be serving as a director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, at the request or
for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as a director,
trustee, officer or employee of any other entity or any benefit plan
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_"), as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with
any DandO Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim
Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from
such DandO Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10)
Business Days after any request for advancement by a DandO Indemnified Party,
advance to such DandO Indemnified Party, any Claim Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any DandO Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO
Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the DandO

 



80  Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnified
Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject to the DandO Indemnifying Partys
receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party
to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined under Applicable
Law that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. The
indemnification and advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time, and any DandO Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts, facts, events or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any DandO Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit
of such Persons heirs, successors, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_: (x) the term " _D andO
Claim_" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed claim, action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or
other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining
to matters that relate to such DandO Indemnified Partys duties or service (A)
as a director, officer or employee of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
thereof at or prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to any
acts, facts, events or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement, the Merger and/or the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any DandO Claim
relating thereto) or (B) as a director, trustee, officer or employee of any
other entity or any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (for which such DandO Indemnified Party is or was serving at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or
prior to the Effective Time; and (y) the term " _Claim Expenses_ " means
reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, legal research, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in (including on appeal), any DandO Claim
for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
7.04(a)_, including any action relating to a claim for indemnification or
advancement brought by a DandO Indemnified Party. No DandO Indemnifying Party
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
actual or threatened DandO Claim in respect of which indemnification has been
sought by such DandO Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such DandO Claim, or
such DandO Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the 

 



81  Company Organizational Documents, similar organizational documents of the
Companys Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on liability of
directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be
required by Applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by
Applicable Law. At the Companys option and expense, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a
six (6)-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express
terms shall survive the Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the directors,
officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing directors and
officers insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time for DandO Claims arising from facts, acts, events or
omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of
the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ ").
If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain such a tail policy;
_provided_ that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum
Premium; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if such tail policy cannot
be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor all its obligations thereunder.

(c) If any of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company,
partnership or other Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_.

 

Section 7.05. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the Benefits Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide,
to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues as an employee of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries (including
Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation) during all or a portion of the
Benefits

 



82  Continuation Period (each, an " _Affected Employee_ ") (x) base salary,
bonus and other cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less
favorable than the base salary, bonus and other cash incentive compensation
opportunities provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (y) employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than
the employee benefits provided to such Affected Employee under the Company
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that, for
purposes of determining that such employee benefits are no less favorable in
the aggregate, equity incentive awards, defined benefit pension plan
benefits, retention or change in control payments or awards or any similar
compensation or benefit, shall not be taken into account, and (z) equity
incentive awards with a target value no less favorable than the target value
of the equity incentive awards provided to such Affected Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.05(a)_, for the period from the Closing Date through
the second anniversary of the Closing Date, each individual who is employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be provided with severance benefits in amounts and on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable than those provided to such individual
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth in the Companys
Severance Pay Plan as amended in accordance with Section 6.01(l) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Affected
Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time
(the " _New Company Plans_ "), Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such Affected Employee under any New
Company Plan that is a health and welfare plan in which such Affected Employee
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, (ii) recognize
service of all Affected Employees (to the extent credited by the Company or
its Subsidiaries) accrued prior to the Effective Time for all purposes under
(but not for the purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan) any New Company Plan in which any such Affected Employee may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in
the duplication of benefits for the same period of service and (iii) if
applicable, cause to be credited, in any New Company Plan that is a health
plan in which Affected Employees participate, any deductibles or out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such Affected Employees and their beneficiaries
and dependents during the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs prior to their participation in Parents health plans with the
objective that there be no double counting during the year in which the
Effective Time occurs of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses, including
through adjustments to health savings accounts.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Employee Plan
containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control" (or
language having a similar meaning), the Closing shall be deemed to constitute
a "change in control" or "change of control" (or language having a similar
meaning).

 

(d) Parent agrees that, with respect to the annual cash incentive plans set
forth on Section 7.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Annual
Incentive Plans_ "), it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide each participant in an Annual Incentive Plan (each an " _Incentive
Plan Participant_ ") who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation
through the end of the year during which the Closing occurs, with an annual
cash incentive

 



83  award for the year during which the Closing occurs, the amount of which
shall be determined as the sum of the following: (i) a pro-rated portion
of the bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that
occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus shall be determined based upon actual
performance through and including the Closing Date, as determined by the
Company in accordance with the applicable Annual Incentive Plan _plus_ (ii) a
pro-rated portion of the bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the
Closing that occurs after the Closing, which bonus shall be at the applicable
Incentive Plan Participants target incentive level under such Annual
Incentive Plan; _provided_ that, if an Incentive Plan Participants employment
is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason following the Closing
Date and through the end of the year during which the Closing occurs (other
than for "cause" (as defined in Section 7.05(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) or, for the avoidance of doubt, any voluntary termination of
employment), such Incentive Plan Participant shall be entitled to the sum of
(A) the prorated payment set forth in clause (i) above _plus_ (B) an amount
equal to the Incentive Plan Participants target value prorated by a ratio
equal to the quotient of the number of days worked between the Closing Date
and the Incentive Plan Participants termination date _divided by_ 365, and
such total amount shall be paid as soon as practicable following such
termination of employment; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
payment of any amounts under the Annual Incentive Plans (or any pro-rated
portion thereof) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.05(d)_ result in the
duplication of payments to any Incentive Plan Participant under any other
incentive, severance or other similar arrangement.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement, express or implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of
its Affiliates to be obligated to continue to employ any Person, including any
Affected Employees, for any period of time following the Effective Time, (ii)
shall prevent Parent or its Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating
any Company Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
policy in effect from time to time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment
of any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or (iv) shall create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or
individual Person, including any present or former employee, officer, director
or individual independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

 

Section 7.06. _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take, or shall cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letters, including: (i) to negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained
in any related fee letter) (or on other terms and conditions agreed by Parent,
the Company and the Financing Sources) by the Closing Date, and (ii) to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied (or, if determined advisable by Parent,
obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing within Parents control and to comply or cause to be complied with
all of its obligations pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters and the
definitive agreements related thereto to the extent the failure to comply with
such obligations would adversely impact the timing of the Closing or the
availability at Closing of sufficient aggregate proceeds of the Debt
Financing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event

 



84  that all conditions to funding the commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters have been satisfied, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the
Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date (including
by taking enforcement action to cause the Financing Sources to provide the
Debt Financing). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce all of its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent
shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to
the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements related thereto of
which Parent has become aware or any termination of any of the Debt Commitment
Letters or such definitive agreements, to the extent such breach or
termination could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
Closing or otherwise result in sufficient proceeds of the Debt Financing to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not being available
at the Closing. In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable and such portion is necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except in accordance with the express terms
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or unless concurrently replaced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by commitments subject to substantially the same
conditions as those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter from other
financing sources or from proceeds of other sources of financing or cash),
Parent and Merger Sub shall (1) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
debt financing for any such portion from alternative debt sources ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount that will enable Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that does
not contain additional (or changes to the) conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this
Agreement that, in each case, could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (2) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. If obtained, Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (including redacted
copies of engagement and fee letters, removing only fee amounts, market "flex"
provisions and certain other terms (none of which concern or would adversely
affect the amounts, availability, timing or conditionality of the Debt
Financing)) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Parent or the Surviving Corporation with Alternative Financing.
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the Companys prior written
consent, permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related thereto unless the terms of such Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related thereto, in each case as so amended, modified
or waived, are substantially similar to those in such Debt Commitment Letter
or definitive agreement related thereto, prior to giving effect to such
amendment, modification or waiver (other than economic terms, which shall be
as good as or better for Parent and Merger Sub than those in the Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement relating thereto prior to giving
effect to such amendment, modification or waiver); _provided_ that, in
the case of amendments or modifications of any Debt Commitment Letter or a
definitive agreement relating thereto, the foregoing shall only apply if such
amendment or modification (x) could reasonably be expected to (I) adversely
affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub timely consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (II) make the timely
funding of the Debt Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur, (y) reduces the

 



85  aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (z) materially and adversely
affects the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, it being understood and agreed
that in any event, Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements relating thereto to (x) add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement and consent to the
assignment after the date of this Agreement of lending commitments under the
Debt Commitment Letters to other lenders, or (y) increase the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing. Parent shall provide the Company with prompt
written notice of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Financing Source with respect to such Financing Sources failure or
anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any Debt Commitment Letters
or definitive agreement in connection therewith. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Debt Financing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents and Merger Subs
obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger
Sub obtaining any financing. The failure, for any reason, other than as a
result of any material breach of this Agreement by the Company, of Parent and
Merger Sub to have sufficient cash available on the date that the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ hereof, and/or the failure
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration on the date that the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ hereof, shall constitute a
Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 

Section 8.01. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to
the other party and its Representatives, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to all of
its properties, books, contracts and records, and, during such period, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party all other information concerning its businesses,
properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request, and instruct
its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with the other party in its
investigation. All information furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of June 7, 2017, between
Parent and the Company, as supplemented by that certain Clean Team
Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 31, 2017, between Parent and the
Company, and the Joint Defense Agreement, effective as of October 18, 2017,
between Parent and the Company (collectively, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent pursuant to this
Agreement.



 



86 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
8.01_, _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, none of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to its properties, books, contracts, records or personnel if such
access would unreasonably disrupt its operations, or provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or
contravene any Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that each of the Company
and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which such restrictions apply (including redacting such
information (i) to remove references concerning valuation, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements in effect on or after the date hereof
and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall either party have access to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other similar information that, in the
reasonable opinion of the applicable party, is sensitive or the disclosure of
which would reasonably be expected to subject such party or any of its
Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Each of the Company and Parent may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel
of the recipient and, subject to any additional confidentiality or joint
defense agreement the parties may mutually propose and enter into, will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

 

Section 8.02. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_, each of the Company and Parent shall, and each
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable,
(x) including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect all
necessary Filings, (ii) obtaining as promptly as practicable and thereafter
maintaining all Consents required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby, and complying
with the terms and conditions of each Consent and (iii) cooperating to the
extent reasonable with the other parties hereto in their efforts to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement, including in seeking to
obtain as promptly as practicable any required Consents and (y) which includes
contesting (which includes by litigation) any (i) action, suit, investigation
or proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority in a federal, state or
administrative court seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or make
illegal consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby
or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection

 



87  with the Merger or (ii) Order that has been entered by a federal, state or
administrative court that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes
illegal consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby
or imposes any damages, terms or conditions in connection with the Merger or
other transactions contemplated hereby. The parties understand and agree that
Parents obligation to use its reasonable best efforts set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ includes taking all actions and doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law (including divestitures,
hold separate arrangements, the termination, assignment, novation or
modification of Contracts (or portions thereof) or other business
relationships, the acceptance of restrictions on business operations and the
entry into other commitments and limitations) to obtain the governmental
approvals described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of the first sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, so long as such actions would not have and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect on Parent or on the Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement will obligate or require
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take or cause to
be taken any action (or refrain or cause to refrain from taking any action) or
agree or cause to agree to any term, condition or limitation (including, in
each case, any of the actions or items referred to in the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_) as a condition to, or in connection with, (x) the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period relating to the
Merger under the HSR Act, (y) any other Antitrust Law or (z) obtaining any
Parent Required Governmental Authorization or Company Required Governmental
Authorization or any other Consent from a Governmental Authority or
otherwise, in each case if such action (or refraining from such action), term,
condition or limitation would have or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect on
Parent or on the Company. " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with
respect to any Person, a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
business, revenue or EBITDA of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; _provided_ that, for purposes of determining whether any action, term
or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Regulatory
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries
will collectively be deemed to be a company the size of (and with revenue and
EBITDA equal to those of) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries);
_provided_ , _ further_ , that, for purposes of determining whether any
action, term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect on Parent or on the Company, impacts on
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
aggregated. " _EBITDA_ " means, with respect to any Person, the sum of (1)
consolidated net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, _plus_ (2)
without duplication and to the extent deducted in determining such
consolidated net income, the sum of (I) consolidated interest expense, (II)
consolidated income tax expense and (III) all amounts attributed to
depreciation or amortization, in each case of such Person and its
Subsidiaries.

(c) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and each shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation
or otherwise), acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire,
purchase, lease or license) any business, corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division or part thereof, or
any securities or collection of assets, if doing so would reasonably be
expected to: (i) impose any

 



88  material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any Consent of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) otherwise prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Parent shall have principal responsibility for directing, devising, and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, for
responding to any request from, inquiry by, or investigation by (including
directing the timing, nature, and substance of all such responses), and for
leading all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority that
has authority to enforce any Antitrust Law.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, make all Filings
with all Governmental Authorities that may be or may become reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement or Applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including: (i) not later than thirty (30) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, Parent filing, or causing to be
filed, "Form A Statements" or similar change of control applications, with the
insurance commissioners or regulators or departments of health or other
Governmental Authorities in each jurisdiction where required by Applicable
Law, seeking approval of Parents acquisition of control of each of the
Regulated Subsidiaries which results from the Merger; (ii) as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent filing, or causing
to be filed, any pre-acquisition notifications on "Form E" or similar market
share notifications to be filed in each jurisdiction where required
by Applicable Laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) not later than twenty (20) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement (unless the parties otherwise agree to another time
period), the Company and Parent each making an appropriate Filing of a
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and requesting early termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act; (iv) the Company and Parent each making any other Filing that may be
required under any other Antitrust Laws or by any Governmental Authority
having antitrust jurisdiction under Applicable Law; (v) not later than thirty
(30) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent filing any required notices to CMS, with a separate notice to the
CMS Medicare Drug Benefit Group and Central Office Medicare Advantage plan
manager, if applicable; and (vi) the Company and Parent each promptly
following the date hereof making any other Filing that may be required under
any Health Care Laws, Insurance Laws or other Applicable Laws or by any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over enforcement of any of the
foregoing.

 

(f) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company and Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable, (i) upon the reasonable request of the
other party, furnish to such party and, upon any reasonable request from a
Governmental Authority, furnish to such

 



89  Governmental Authority, any information or documentation concerning
themselves, their Affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, information or documentation concerning the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and such other matters
as may be requested and (ii) make available their respective Representatives
to each other and, upon reasonable request, any Governmental Authority,
in connection with (A) the preparation of any Filing made by or on their
behalf to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or (B) any Governmental Authority
investigation, review or approval process.

(g) Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information and
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement and all other
agreements entered into by the parties to this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to: (i) (A) as far in
advance as practicable, notify the other party of and consult the other party
with respect to any Filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry
it or any of its Affiliates intends to make with any Governmental Authority
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, (B) prior to
submitting any such Filing or making any such communication or inquiry, the
submitting or making party shall provide the other party and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith the
comments of the other party in connection with any such Filing, communication
or inquiry, and (C) promptly following the submission of such Filing or making
of such communication or inquiry, provide the other party and its counsel
with a copy of any such Filing, communication or inquiry or, if such
communication or inquiry is made in oral form, a summary of any such oral

any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or

failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured by the End Date or (B) has

notice to the Company from Parent of such breach or failure to perform, but
only so long as Parent is not then in breach of its representations,

_Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_ not to be satisfied;

(iii) the Company shall have breached any of its obligations under

Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.01(d)(iv)_ in respect of such

period); or

 

(v) prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in order to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for a Company Superior Proposal (which
definitive agreement must be entered into concurrently with, or immediately
following, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.01(d)(v)_) in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of,

the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ (other than the condition

in respect of the matters contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and/or (z) of the
first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_) and _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ (other
than the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_) have been satisfied
(or in the case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the
date of such termination) or waived, then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
a fee in the amount of $2,100,000,000 (the " _Regulatory Termination Fee_ ")
to the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days following such termination); _provided_ that no
Regulatory Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.03(c)_ if the failure of the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_ to be satisfied is caused by the Companys Willful
Breach of  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_.

(d) Any payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination
Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or

(e) The parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the Company

in no event shall Parent be required to pay either the Parent Termination Fee
or the Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion, or more than one
of the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee under any
circumstances, and (y) in no event shall Parent be entitled, pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.03_, to receive an amount greater than the Company
Termination Fee and any applicable additional amounts pursuant the last two
sentences of this _Section_ __ _ 10.03(e)_ (" _Parent Additional Amounts_ "),
and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 10.03_, to receive an amount greater than the Parent Termination Fee or the
Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, and any applicable additional
amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_ or the last two sentences of
this _Section_ __ _ 10.03(e)_ (collectively, " _Company Additional Amounts_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of fraud, (i) if Parent receives the Company Termination Fee and any
applicable Parent Additional Amounts from the Company pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.03_, or if the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee
or the Regulatory Termination Fee and any applicable Company Additional
Amounts from Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, such payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the
paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or
future partners, shareholders, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and
Representatives, and none of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective former, current or future partners, shareholders,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation, in each case relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) if (A)
Parent or Merger Sub receive any payments from the Company in respect of any
breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this

 



103   _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent
or Merger Sub in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter the
Company receives the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, the amount of such Company
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee, as
applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by
the party paying the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or
Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, in respect of any such breaches.
The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _
10.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and
that any amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ do not
constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, such party shall also pay
any costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by the party entitled to such payment in connection with a legal
action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount
against the party failing to promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid
when due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ shall bear interest from the
date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate
as published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ in effect on the
date of such payment.

(f) None of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company
or any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to giving effect to
the Merger relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Debt Financing,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither
the Company nor any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to
giving effect to the Merger shall have any rights or claims directly against
any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. For the avoidance of any
doubt, the foregoing shall not impair, supplement, or otherwise modify any of
the commitments and other obligations that the Financing Sources have under
the Debt Commitment Letters to Parent and/or Merger Sub or any of the rights
of Parent and/or Merger Sub against any of the Financing Sources under the
Debt Commitment Letters.

the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

AETNA INC.

 

(A Pennsylvania Corporation)

 

This Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation amends and restates
the existing Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation and has been duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting in accordance
with Section 1727(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as
amended and by the shareholders of the Corporation by unanimous written
consent in lieu of a meeting in accordance with Section 1766 of the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended.

 

These Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation supersede the
original articles of incorporation of the Corporation, and all amendments
thereto.

The Articles of Incorporation of Aetna Inc., as amended hereby, shall, upon
the effectiveness hereof, read in its entirety, as follows:

1. _Name_. The name of the corporation is Aetna Inc. (the " _Corporation_ "). 

2. _Registered Office_. The address of the Corporations registered office in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the Corporations principal office at 1425 Union Meeting Road, Blue Bell, PA 19422 (which is located in Montgomery County). 

 

3. _Incorporation_. The Corporation is incorporated under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the " _PA BCL_ "). 

4. _Purpose_. The purpose of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful act and activity for which corporations may be organized and incorporated under the PA BCL. 

 

5. _Authorized Capital_. 

 

5.1. _Authorized Shares_. The aggregate number of shares of stock that the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 100 Common Shares, par value
$0.01 (" _Common Stock_ "). 5.2. _Common Stock_. The following is a statement of the designations,
preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions and special or relative
rights granted or imposed upon the shares of Common Stock of the Corporation:

 

5.2.1. _Dividends_. Holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
ratably such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be
declared by the board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of
Directors_ ") on Common Stock out of funds legally available for the payment
thereof.

 

5.2.2. _Distribution of Assets_. In the event of the voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the
holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive pro rata all of the
remaining assets of the Corporation.

 

5.2.3. _Voting Rights_. The holders of Common Stock shall have the general
right to vote for all purposes, including the election of directors, as
provided by law. Each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for
each share thereof held.

 

6. _Bylaws_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), except as otherwise specifically provided therein, subject to the powers of the shareholders of the Corporation to amend or repeal any bylaws adopted by the Board of Directors. 

7. _Number; Election of Directors_. The Board of Directors shall consist of at least one director, or such other number of directors as determined in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot. 

8. _Indemnification_. 

 

8.1. _Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action or proceeding, including without limitation actions by or
in the right of the Corporation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving while a director or officer
of the Corporation at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent, fiduciary or other representative of another corporation
(for profit or not-for-profit), limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against all
liabilities, expenses (including without limitation attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, excise taxes and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with such action or proceeding unless the act or failure to act by
such person giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined by a
court to have constituted willful misconduct or recklessness. The Corporation
shall have the power to indemnify employees and agents of the Corporation on
the same basis as provided above in this _Article 8.1_ , and to advance
expenses to employees and agents on the same basis as provided in _Article
8.2_ , as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or authorize.

 

8.2. _Advancement of Expenses_. Expenses (including without limitation
attorneys fees) incurred by any person who was or is an officer or director
of the Corporation in defending any action or proceeding referred to in
_Article 8.1_ shall automatically be paid by the Corporation, without the need
for action by the Board of Directors, in advance of the final disposition of
the action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

 



2 8.3. _Exception_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Article 8_ to the
contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any person under
_Article 8.1_ or advance expenses under _Article 8.2_ with respect to
proceedings, claims or actions commenced by such person, other than mandatory
counterclaims and affirmative defenses.

8.4. _Interpretation_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by or pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any insurance policy, agreement, vote of
shareholders or directors, or otherwise, both as to actions in such persons
official capacity and as to actions in another capacity while holding an
office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such person. If the PA BCL is amended to permit a
Pennsylvania corporation to provide greater rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses for its directors and officers than the express terms
of this _Article 8_ , this _Article 8_ shall be construed to provide for such
greater rights.

 

8.5. _Contract_. The duties of the Corporation to indemnify and to advance
expenses to a director or officer as provided in this _Article 8_ shall be in
the nature of a contract between the Corporation and each such person, and no
amendment or repeal of any provision of this _Article 8_ shall alter, to the
detriment of such person, the right of such person to the advancement of
expenses or indemnification related to a claim based on an act or failure to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal or the termination of
the service of the person as a director or officer, whichever is earlier.

9. _Limitation of Directors  Liability_. No person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be personally liable, as such, for monetary damages (other than under criminal statutes and under federal, state and local laws imposing liability on directors for the payment of taxes) unless the persons conduct constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness. No amendment or repeal of this _Article 9_ shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any person who is or was a director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of the director occurring prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal. If the PA BCL is amended to permit a Pennsylvania corporation to provide greater protection from personal liability for its directors than the express terms of this _Article 9_ , this _Article 9_ shall be construed to provide for such greater protection. 

 

10. _Limitation of Officers  Liability_. No person who is or was an officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable, as such, for monetary damages (other than under criminal statutes and under federal, state and local laws imposing liability on officers for the payment of taxes) unless the persons conduct constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness. No amendment or repeal of this _Article 10_ shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any person who is or was an officer of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of the officer occurring prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal. If the PA BCL is amended to permit a Pennsylvania corporation to provide greater protection from personal liability for its officers than the express terms of this _Article 10_ , this _Article 10_ shall be construed to provide for such greater protection. 

 



3 11. _Right to Amend_. Except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law, the Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation as the same may from time to time be in effect, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights, preferences and privileges conferred on shareholders hereunder are subject to such reservation.
