ARTICLE III 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION

  



  

Section 3.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Merger Sub-
Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock and associated
Stockholder Right (to the extent outstanding at the Effective Time) that is
directly owned by Parent or Merger Sub or held by the Company as treasury
shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock and associated Stockholder Right (to
the extent outstanding at the Effective Time) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive a cash payment equal to $7.25 per share, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock and associated Stockholder Rights (to the
extent outstanding at the Effective Time) shall cease to be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock and associated Stockholder
Rights (to the extent outstanding at the Effective Time) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock and associated
Stockholder Rights (to the extent outstanding at the Effective Time) in
accordance with Section 3.02, without interest thereon.

(ii) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
, that nothing in this Section 3.01(c)(ii) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.02 Exchange and Payment.

  



  

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration. At and after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, an amount
of cash sufficient to deliver to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
the aggregate Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.01. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Payment Fund." The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to Section 3.01, except as
provided in this Agreement. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in the Payment Fund
as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, or in certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be solely the
property of Parent and shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained
herein, and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment
Fund, shall diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. If for any
reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of shares shall be entitled under Section 3.01, Parent shall
take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation
promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent
sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment
thereof.

(b) Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event more than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of an outstanding certificate or outstanding
certificates ("Certificates") and to each holder of uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented on a book entry basis ("Book-Entry Shares")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock that, together with their associated Stockholder Rights
(to the extent outstanding at the Effective Time), were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 3.01(c), (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such Person shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may reasonably specify), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares and the Stockholder Rights associated with such shares (to
the extent outstanding at the Effective Time) pursuant to Section 3.01(c).
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal (or, in the case of a
Book-Entry Share, upon delivery of such letter of transmittal or upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Book-
Entry Shares on a book-entry account statement), duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as the Exchange Agent or Parent may reasonably require (a "Proper
Delivery"), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c) in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share and the Stockholder Rights associated with such shares (to the extent
outstanding at the Effective Time). No interest will be paid or accrued on
any Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Payment of Merger Consideration shall be made as promptly as
practicable after the date of Proper Delivery of the applicable
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share.

  



  

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred (together with any associated Stockholder Rights) and
that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

--- 

   

  



  

(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or associated Stockholder Right (to the
extent outstanding at the Effective Time) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, and the Stockholder
Rights associated with such shares (to the extent outstanding at the Effective
Time), pursuant to Section 3.01(c), without any interest thereon.

  



  

(iv) For the sake of clarity, to the extent any Stockholder Rights are
outstanding at the Effective Time, no shares of Company Common Stock or Book-
Entry Shares shall be accepted for payment without the associated Stockholder
Rights, and no Stockholder Rights shall be accepted for payment without the
associated shares of Company Common Stock or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights (including, without limitation, all Stockholder
Rights, to the extent outstanding at the Effective Time) pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Stockholder
Right is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, then such
Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Stockholder Right shall be canceled against
delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article III.

  



  

(d) Termination of the Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
by the Exchange Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the provisions of this Article III. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public
official in compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity)
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto, without any interest
thereon.

  



  

(f) Other. Parent shall have the right to require the Exchange Agent to
return to Parent any portion of the Merger Consideration made available
to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares.

  



  

Section 3.03 Company Stock Options.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such
actions that do not involve payments (other than as described in this Section
3.03(a)) as may be reasonably necessary to provide that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Company Stock Option") that is then outstanding and unvested shall
become fully vested and each unexercised Company Stock Option that is then
outstanding shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Company
Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash (the "Option
Amount") equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then subject to such Company Stock Option. If the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option
shall be canceled with no payment due to the holder thereof and shall have no
further force or effect. Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive
from the Surviving Corporation, with respect to such Company Stock Option, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the Option
Amount, net of any required withholding of Tax.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or releases, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from holders of Company
Stock Options and take all such other action, in all cases, without incurring
any liabilities in connection therewith, as Parent may reasonably deem to be
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
3.03. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 3.03 (unless such resolutions or actions have
been adopted or taken, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement).

  



  

(c) The actions provided for in this Section 3.03 shall be effected in a
manner which is consistent with Section 409A of the Code, to avoid any
violation thereof to the extent applicable, and the terms of the Company
Stock Option. At an appropriate time after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall mail to each holder of Company Stock Options a letter
describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options
pursuant to this Section 3.03 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Company Stock Options, to the extent applicable. Parent
shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, at all times from and after the
Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy their obligations
to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 3.03.

  



  

   

16 
--- 

 


--- 

   

  



  

Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(without duplication) from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options and from any other recipient
of a payment hereunder such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, applicable Treasury
Regulations or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options or to such other
payment recipient, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent.

  



  

Section 3.05 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor otherwise consented thereto in
writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
consideration described in Section 3.01(c)(i). Such holders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common
Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses any such appraisal rights or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to appraisal
rights, each such share of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall no
longer be considered a Dissenting Share and each such share and its associated
Stockholder Rights (if any) shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.01(c)(i), without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or
written threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware law received by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof shall,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to do
or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.06 Further Action. The Parties shall execute and deliver such
certificates and other documents and take such other actions as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Merger, including
making filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL. If at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary to vest in the
Surviving Corporation the title to all property or rights of Merger Sub or
the Company, then the directors and authorized officers of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of Merger Sub or the Company, as
the case may be, to take, and shall take, any and all such lawful action.

SEC Documents.

be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries to provide goods and services to their customers. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of such Permits, all fees and charges with respect to

Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no event
has occurred and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists with
respect to any Company Employee Plan that would subject the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, either directly or by reason of its
affiliation with the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, to any excise tax, fine,
lien or penalty imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws. Each
Company Employee Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code is the subject of an unrevoked favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS (or is based on a pre-approved prototype plan document and may
rely on the opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor which covers
the current form of the plan). To the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred with respect to any such Company Employee Plan that has resulted or
is likely to result in the revocation of such determination as to such
Company Employee Plan.

  



  

(d) No Company Employee Plan is or, at any time during the last six (6)
years, was (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii)
a multiple employer plan, multiple employer welfare arrangement, voluntary
employees' beneficiary association or a multiemployer plan within the meaning
of ERISA and the Code, (iii) required by its terms to provide
employee welfare benefits (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA),
including health and life insurance, to current or future retired or
terminated employees, independent contractors, directors, or their spouses or
dependents (other than in accordance with applicable Law, including, without
limitation, Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA), or (iv) funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as such term is
defined in Section 419(e) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any current or contingent liability or obligation under or
with respect to any "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that
is subject to, Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(e) No "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to
any Company Employee Plan that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened legal action, proceeding, or investigation, other than routine
claims for benefits, concerning any Company Employee Plan, which, if decided
adversely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) No employer securities, employer real property or other employer
property is included in the assets of any Company Employee Plan.

  



  

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, full payment has been made of all amounts which the Company was
required under the terms of the Company Employee Plans to have paid before
the Effective Time as contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions), premium payments or other payments
to such Company Employee Plans within the time period prescribed by ERISA.

  



  

(h) Except as provided in Section 4.15(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is not a party to
any Contract the amounts payable from which would fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or Section 162(m) of
the Code. With respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company has complied in good faith with all
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable
thereto, and each such plan has (if applicable) been operated in good faith
compliance with the transitional relief and all guidance and regulations
provided by the IRS under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company
Employee Plan mandated by a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or subject to the
Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States that is intended to
qualify for special tax treatment meets all of the requirements for such
treatment and has obtained all necessary approvals of all relevant
Governmental Entities.

  



  

(j) No equity awards, other than the Company Stock Options listed on
Section 4.02(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter are currently
outstanding, whether under the Company Stock Plans, under other equity plans
sponsored by the Company, or pursuant to individual grants.

(k) Any Company Employee Plan may be amended or terminated at any time
without any material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
subject to applicable Law and to the statutory and contractual obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay any earned and vested benefits
thereunder.

  



  

Section 4.16 Taxes.

  



  

(a) The Company and each Subsidiary thereof have timely filed all
material Tax Returns that they were required to file under applicable Laws,
subject to any applicable extensions. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
thereof is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to
file any such Tax Return. To the Knowledge of the Company, no claim is
pending or has been made since July 31, 2010, by any Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company or a Subsidiary thereof does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary thereof is or may be subject to
material taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) All Taxes due and owing by the Company and each Subsidiary thereof

(c) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due

(d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has received from any
Governmental Entity any written (i) notice indicating or request relating to
an intent to open an audit or other review related to any material Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, or (ii) notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment with respect to material Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof. No material proceedings are currently
pending or being conducted with respect to any Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
accurate copies of all material examination reports and material statements
of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company and each of its
Subsidiary since July 31, 2010. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
thereof has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to
any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency that
remains in effect nor has any request been made in writing for any
such extension or waiver. To the Knowledge of the Company, no requests for
ruling or determination letters or competent authority relief with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently pending with any
Governmental Entity with respect to a material amount of Taxes. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any private letter ruling of
the Internal Revenue Service or any comparable ruling of any other
Governmental Entity in the United States, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any other Governmental Entity, with respect to a material amount of Taxes.

corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the

(f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof is a party to any Tax
allocation, Tax sharing or similar agreement between the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof, on the one hand, and any other Person (other than the
Company and any Subsidiary thereof), on the other hand (other than customary
agreements with customers, vendors, lessors and/or other third parties entered
into in the ordinary course of business). To the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any material
Contract to pay, indemnify or make any Tax "gross-up" payments with respect
to any Tax Liabilities of any stockholder, director, officer or other
employee or contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof.

  



  

(g) During the last five (5) years, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which is the Company) for federal, state, local or foreign Tax
purposes. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has any material
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and any
Subsidiary thereof) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise, other than under customary agreements with customers,
vendors, lessors and other third parties entered into in the ordinary course
of business.

  



  

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has been either a

distribution as a distribution governed by Section 355 of the Code.

for which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has paid or is
obligated to pay all or part of the premiums (excluding any health insurance
policies or workers' compensation insurance policies, the "Material Insurance
Policies"). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
received written notice of any pending or threatened termination or premium
increase (retroactive or otherwise) with respect to any Material Insurance
Policy, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
all conditions contained in each Material Insurance Policy. There have been
no lapses (whether cured or not) in the coverage provided under the Material
Insurance Policies or any predecessor policies insuring similar risk, during
the term of any such policy, as extended or renewed. As of the date hereof,
the Company has disclosed to Parent all claims (whether pending, denied,

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens. Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure

any conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, amendments,
accelerations, cancellations or Liens, or where the failure to obtain any

respect to Parent or Merger Sub that Parent or any of its
Representatives supplies in writing to the Company expressly for use in the
Company Proxy Statement, if any (and any amendment or supplement thereto), at

stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, will contain any untrue statement

judgments promptly in accordance with their terms and all other obligations
of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable.

otherwise) or assets of the Company, and acknowledges that it has
been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, assets, premises,
books and records, and other documents and data of the Company for such
purpose. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that: (a) in
making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, it has relied solely upon its own
investigation and the express representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Article IV of this Agreement (including the related portions of
the Company Disclosure Letter); and (b) neither the Company nor any other
Person has made any representation or warranty as to the Company or this
Agreement, except as expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement

Takeover Proposal from any Person after the date of this Agreement that the
Company Board determines in good faith constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and after the Company Board having
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that

fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, (i) furnish confidential information
with respect to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary standstill

time prior to the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may, in
response to an unsolicited _bona_ _fide_ written Takeover Proposal from any
Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal if: (i) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least
five (5) days (together with any three (3) day notice period described below,
the "Notice Period") before making an Adverse Recommendation Change or
entering into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (or
material modification thereto), identifying the Person making such Superior
Proposal and stating that the Company Board has resolved to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or the Company or any Subsidiary thereof intends to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; (ii)

use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their financial and
legal advisors to, during each Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that, in the event of any material revisions to the Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this Section 6.02 (including a new Notice
Period pursuant to this Section 6.02(f), provided that such new Notice Period
must only be at least three (3) days in length) with respect to such new
written notice and the revised Superior Proposal contemplated thereby; and
(iii) at the end of the applicable Notice Period, the Company Board determines
that the Takeover Proposal described in such written notice constitutes a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed and irrevocably committed to by Parent during such Notice Period;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(f) during any Notice Period. None of the Company, the Company
Board or any committee of the Company Board shall (and none of the foregoing
shall permit any Subsidiary of the Company or any board of directors or
similar governing body or committee thereof to) enter into any agreement with
any Person to limit or not to give prior notice to Parent of the intention by
the Company, the Company Board and any committee of the Company Board (or any
Subsidiary of the Company or any board of directors or similar governing body
or committee thereof) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

(a) The Company shall afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, under the supervision of the Company's or its

as practicable to Parent all information concerning the business, properties
and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
provide access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably
determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the protection of
the attorney-client or any other privilege of the Company, contravene any
Law, any fiduciary duty or any Contract to which the Company is a party
or cause significant competitive harm to the Company and its business if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, so long as
the Company has taken all reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to
disclose such information on a basis that does not contravene the applicable
Law or Contract or waive the Company's privilege with respect thereto;
_provided_ , that such access and information shall be granted or made
available, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent (subject to
external counsel entering into a customary common interest agreement with the
Company, on terms mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company) to the extent
required for the purpose of complying with applicable Laws, including

consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not contact any suppliers to, or
customers of, the Company or its Subsidiaries and Parent shall have no right
to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of any owned or leased real
property of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to (and from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) honor in accordance with their terms and
conditions as of the date hereof (i) the employment and severance agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
director, officer or other employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, (ii) the existing Company Employee
Plans with respect to accrued and vested benefits thereunder, and (iii) the

performance under the existing performance criteria through the earlier of the
end of the fiscal year or the date of termination of such employee's
employment, provided that no employee who voluntarily terminates their

(b)  With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their

"Parent Benefit Plans") in which any employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Company Continuing Employees") will participate effective
on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, recognize all service
of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its

vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement
subsidies under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension
plan or (ii) benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation or other paid time
off, if applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;
_provided, that_ such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x)
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such
service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.

(c) With respect to each Company Continuing Employee who begins
participation in a group health plan maintained by the Parent, the Surviving

the Effective Time occurs, the Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of such Subsidiaries, as applicable, to take
into account any and all expenses incurred by such Company
Continuing Employee during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs under any previous group health plan in which the Company Continuing
Employees participated, for purposes of determining deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket limits under the Parent\'s, the Surviving Corporation\'s,
or any such Subsidiaries' group health plan for the remainder of that calendar
year. Parent shall waive or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to waive limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Company Continuing Employees to the
extent such limitations were not applicable to such Company Continuing

(d) This Section 7.03 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section

remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.03.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving

respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or
kind whatsoever.

execution and delivery of this Agreement) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time,
and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a "run-off" or
"tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail
Policy") for the directors and officers of the Company in respect of matters,
acts, omissions and occurrences existing or occurring prior to or at the
Closing, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for
six (6) years (the "Coverage Period") of not less than the existing coverage
under, and have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured
persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company ("DandO Insurance Policies");
_provided_ , that the Company shall not purchase a DandO Tail Policy for an
aggregate cost in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for the DandO Insurance Policies (the "Maximum
Premium"). Section 7.04(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the
current annual premium paid by the Company for the DandO Insurance Policies.
During the Coverage Period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
(i) maintain the DandO Tail Policy in effect ( _provided_ , that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may, in its sole discretion, substitute therefor
policies from an insurer with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts
and containing terms and conditions that are not, in the aggregate, less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company than the DandO
Insurance Policies) and (ii) if the DandO Tail Policy ceases to be in effect,
obtain and fully pay for a replacement "tail" insurance policy therefor,
which such replacement "tail" insurance policy shall have a claims period
covering the Coverage Period and be from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with at least
the same coverage and amounts and containing the same terms and conditions
that are not, in the aggregate, less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company, in each case, than the DandO Insurance Policies with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events that occurred before or
at the Effective Time (including, without limitation, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation or Parent be required to expend an aggregate
amount in excess of the Maximum Premium for such replacement "tail" insurance
policies.

  



  

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
cause proper provision to be made so that such successors and assigns shall
expressly assume (including by operation of Law) the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.04.

  



  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.04 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 7.04 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 7.04 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this

Company Proxy Statement) and any amendment or supplement to the preliminary
Company Proxy Statement. Except in the event of an Adverse Recommendation
Change specifically permitted by Section 6.02(f), the Company Proxy Statement

after the execution of this Agreement, and in any event no later than twenty
(20) days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall file with
the SEC the preliminary Company Proxy Statement and, thereafter, shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the preliminary Company Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable;  _provided_ , that the Company
shall furnish such preliminary Company Proxy Statement to Parent and give
Parent and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such
preliminary Company Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall
reasonably consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. The Company shall notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC staff with respect to the
preliminary Company Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
provide to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable, copies of all
written correspondence (and summaries of any oral comments) between the
Company or any Representative of the Company and the SEC with respect to the
Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent and its legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
response to any comment of the SEC staff and any amendment or supplement to

filing with the SEC and shall reasonably consider in good faith all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in
connection therewith. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the
Company with such information as may be required to be included in the
Company Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably required to respond to any
comment of the SEC staff. After all the comments received from the SEC have
been cleared by the SEC staff and all information required to be contained in
the Company Proxy Statement has been included therein by the Company, the
Company shall file the definitive Company Proxy Statement with the SEC and
cause the Company Proxy Statement to be disseminated (including by electronic
delivery if permitted) as promptly as reasonably practicable, to its
stockholders of record, as of the record date established by the Company
Board. Each of the Parties shall correct promptly any information provided by
it to be used specifically in the Company Proxy Statement, if required, that
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and shall take
all steps necessary to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any
amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement so as to correct the
same and to cause the Company Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case to the extent
required by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the

reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any
event, no later than thirty (30) days after the filing of the definitive
Company Proxy Statement with the SEC) for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") and, except in
the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by
Section 6.02(f), the Company shall include in the Company Proxy Statement the
Company Board Recommendation. Except in the event of an Adverse Recommendation
Change specifically permitted by Section 6.02(f), the Company Board shall use

Stock the Company Requisite Vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms

of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting even if the
Company Board shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified the Company
Board Recommendation or otherwise effected an Adverse Recommendation Change

(c) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its
terms pursuant to Article IX, neither the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to the Company of a Takeover Proposal (whether or
not a Superior Proposal), nor any furnishing of information, discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto, nor any decision or action by the Company
Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change shall give the Company any
right to delay, defer or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting with the consent of Parent (and shall so adjourn
or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting if requested to do so by Parent)
to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment
to the Company Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's stockholders or,
if as of the time the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (as set forth
in the Company Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

effective at the Effective Time. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cause the transfer of any shares of the capital stock or

the Company or its Subsidiaries to a Person or Persons designated by Parent

take all such steps as may be reasonably required to cause to be exempt under

Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
shares) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or
officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

  



  

Section 7.12 Takeover Provisions. Each of the Company and the Company Board
shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no
Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreements or the transactions provided for herein or therein, including the
Merger, and (ii) if any Takeover Provision becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, and their respective board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Takeover Provision inapplicable to the foregoing.

bankers, financial advisors or other similar agents (other than the Company
Financial Advisor) or (ii) amend its engagement letter, or otherwise modify
its relationship, with the Company Financial Advisor, in either case, to the
extent any such action would increase the amount of fees, costs,
commissions or other similar charges payable to any such parties in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 7.14 Confidentiality Agreements. Except as set forth in Section 6.02,
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,

or any agreement by a third party not to acquire assets or securities of the

Section 10.07 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, and any purported assignment without such
consent shall be null and void; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub may,
without the consent of the Company, assign their respective rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent so long as Parent continues to remain primarily liable
for all of such rights and obligations. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 10.08 Specific Enforcement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at Law or in equity.

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any such term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  



  

Section 10.10 Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this
Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.
