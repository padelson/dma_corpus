 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

 Section 1. Description of Transaction 

  

 1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined in  _Section 1.3_), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. By virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

   

 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place remotely via the exchange of signature pages, on a date to be designated by Parent which shall be not more than three Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ and _7_ (other than conditions that by their nature are only satisfied as of the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions), or such other Business Day as the Company 

   ##### 

  

   

and Parent may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually takes
place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, the Company shall execute a certificate of merger in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and concurrently with or as soon as
practicable following the Closing the Company shall cause such certificate to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall become effective at the time such certificate of merger is filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
Parent and the Company may agree and specify in such certificate of merger.
The time as of which the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the "
_Effective Time_." 

   

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

   

 (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to conform to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until amended in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read: "The name of the corporation is Peplin, Inc."; 

  

 (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Peplin, Inc.; and 

  

 (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 1.5 Conversion of Shares, Options and Warrants. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Stockholder: 

  

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; for the avoidance of doubt, shares of Company Common Stock held in escrow by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (" _JPMorgan_ ") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of June 9, 2008, by and among the Company, West Acquisitions Corporation, Neosil, Inc. and Nicholas J. Simon, III (the " _Neosil Merger Agreement_ ") and that certain Escrow Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2008, by and among the Company, Neosil, Inc., Nicholas Simon III and JPMorgan (the " _Neosil Escrow Agreement_ "), shall not be deemed to be held by the Company or by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to _Section 1.5(b),_ _Section 1.5(c)_ and _Section 1.5(d)_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company Options before the Effective Time but excluding any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "); 

  

 (iv) each outstanding and unexercised Company Option shall be treated as set forth in  _Section 5.3(a)_; 

  

 (v) each outstanding and unexercised Company Warrant shall be treated as set forth in  _Section 5.3(b)_; 

  

 (vi) each share of Company Common Stock held in escrow by JPMorgan pursuant to the Neosil Merger Agreement and the Neosil Escrow Agreement shall be converted into the Per Share Merger Consideration, but pursuant to Section 9 of the Neosil Escrow Agreement, such Per Share Merger Consideration shall remain in escrow with JPMorgan, until released pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the conditions of, the Neosil Merger Agreement and Neosil Escrow Agreement; and 

  

 (vii) each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if the Company declares a stock dividend during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event occurs during such period, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for in  _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_, but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as 

   ##### 

  

 

Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as if such shares
never had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the
holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 1.7_, the
total amount of cash consideration to which such holder would be entitled in
respect thereof under _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ as if such shares never had been
Dissenting Shares (and all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement to have become deliverable to such holder pursuant to  _Section
1.5(a)(iii)_). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL
and received by the Company, and (ii) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or
demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (d) In the event there is a breach by the Company of any of the representations of the Company in _Section 2.2(a)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_, and as a result of the facts giving rise to such breach, the aggregate amounts payable under _Section 1.5(a)_ and _Section 5.3_ or otherwise in respect of any other equity securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are entitled to receive consideration as a consequence of the Merger would exceed the sum of (i) $287.5 million plus (ii) the aggregate exercise price of any Company Options or Company Warrants exercised between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, to the extent actually received by the Company (such sum, the " _Maximum Aggregate Consideration_ "), then Parent at its election may adjust the Per Share Merger Consideration to be an amount determined as follows: the sum of (1) the Maximum Aggregate Consideration plus (2) the aggregate exercise price of all Company Options and Company Warrants outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, such sum then divided by the sum of the following: (X) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares held by Parent, Company, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; (Y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to all Company Options and Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming no net exercise thereof); and (Z) the number (based on the number of shares of Company Common Stock to which it is equivalent, calculated on a treasury stock method) of any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock, or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, Company Common Stock, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the effect of any change to the rate of exchange between Australian Dollars and United States Dollars after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded. 

  

 1.6 Payment Fund. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as paying agent under this Agreement for the purpose of distributing the aggregate cash consideration distributable pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ and _Section 5.3(b)_ (the " _Cash Consideration_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting 

   ##### 

  

   

Shares) and holders of Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Cash Consideration (the " _Payment Fund_ "). 

   

 1.7 Payment Procedures. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and each holder of a Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (such certificates and Company Warrants, collectively, the " _Certificates_ "), and each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (including Share CDIs held on an issuer-sponsored subregister or CHESS subregister, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "): (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effective, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably specify; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for such holders applicable portion of the Cash Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, in adherence with the applicable procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions to the letter of transmittal, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Cash Consideration as contemplated by _Section 1.5_. 

  

 (b) No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Cash Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company Warrant which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration otherwise payable with respect thereto shall be payable to such transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock or Company Warrant is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 1.8 Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not complied with the provisions of this _Section 1_ as of that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Warrants formerly represented thereby, and Parent shall, upon the request of any such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, promptly pay to such Persons the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration to which such Persons is entitled. Any such portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by a 

   #####

meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of
such Superior Offer (including a copy of any draft definitive agreement
relating to such Superior Offer to the extent such a draft definitive
agreement exists) and the identity of the Person making such Superior Offer;
(D) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that, in light of such
Superior Offer, the failure to so withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent the Company Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (E) the Company Board
Recommendation is not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent at
any time within the period of five Business Days after Parent receives written
notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board has determined that
the failure to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Board Recommendation in light of such Superior Offer would be reasonably
likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (F) during such
five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the offer that was determined to constitute a Superior Offer no longer
constitutes a Superior Offer or that no withdrawal or modification in a manner
adverse to Parent of the Company Board Recommendation is required as a result
of such offer; and (G) at the end of such five Business Day period, such
offer has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Offer and
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with
the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to constitute a breach
of the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements in light of such Superior
Offer (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement or any
alternative transaction proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(F)" or otherwise); or 

  

 (ii) if: (A) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material development or material change in circumstances that relates to the Acquired Corporations but does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (any such material development or material change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry being referred to as an " _Intervening Event_ "); (B) no Acquired Corporation, and no Representative of any Acquired Corporation, had knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that such Intervening Event was reasonably likely to occur or arise after the date of this Agreement; (C) the Company provides Parent, at least two Business Days prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which such board of directors will consider and determine whether such Intervening Event may require the Company to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation (or such lesser period as is provided to the directors), with a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a description of such Intervening Event; (D) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure to so withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (E) the Company Board Recommendation is not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent at any time within the period of five Business Days after Parent receives written notice from the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company confirming that the Company Board has determined that the failure to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation in light of such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (F) during such
five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
no withdrawal or modification in a manner adverse to Parent to the Company
Board Recommendation is legally required as a result of such Intervening
Event; and (G) at the end of such five Business Day period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Company Board Recommendation would still be reasonably likely to constitute
a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements in light of such Intervening
Event (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement or any
alternative transaction proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(F)" or otherwise). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 5.2(a)_, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be postponed or adjourned in order to enable the additional time to solicit proxies from the Company Stockholders. 

  

 (e) Prior to a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with  _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, making, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, by any Intervening Event or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation.

 (a) Each Company Option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the Effective Time with a per share exercise price less than the Per Share Merger Consideration (an " _In-the-Money Option_ ") (i) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the difference between (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such In-the-Money Option, and (B) the aggregate exercise price of such In-the-Money Option, and (ii) at the Effective Time, each In-the-Money Option will, to the extent not vested, accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not an In-the-Money Option will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the Effective Time without any consideration payable in respect thereof. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and if practicable by the next regularly scheduled payroll date; _provided, however,_ that it would be considered not practicable if such 

   ##### 

  

    

payroll date is within ten days following the Closing Date), Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay over to each holder of In-the-Money Options
the aggregate cash consideration payable to such holder of In-the-Money
Options pursuant to this _Section 5.3(a)_. Such cash consideration shall be
rounded down to the nearest cent and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such cash
consideration such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable Legal Requirement. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of In-the-Money Options in
respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) Each outstanding Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested, as of immediately before the Effective Time with a per share purchase price less than the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _In-the-Money Warrants_ ") (i) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the difference between (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Warrant, and (B) the aggregate purchase price of such Company Warrant, and (ii) at the Effective Time, each In-the-Money Warrant will, to the extent not vested, accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested, outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not an In-the-Money Warrant will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the Effective Time without any consideration payable in respect thereof. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such cash consideration such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of In-the-Money Warrants in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. To the extent required by the terms of the applicable Company Warrant, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will provide each holder of Company Warrants with a letter that conforms to the applicable notice and purchase requirements of such holders Company Warrant and sets forth the treatment of such holders Company Warrants as determined by this _Section 5.3(b)_. 

  

 5.4 Employee Benefits. 

   

 (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") will be eligible to participate in: (i) Parents employee benefit plans and programs, including any equity incentive plan, pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, Section 401(k) plan, bonus plan, profit sharing plan, severance plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time-off programs and disability plan, in each case to the same extent as similarly situated employees of 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent; and (ii) such Company Employee Plans as are continued by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, or are assumed by
Parent (for the purposes of this  _Section 5.3(b) _only, the plans referred
to in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this sentence being referred to as "
_Specified Parent Benefit Plans_ "). Each Continuing Employee shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, receive full credit
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and vacation (but not for purposes of
benefit accrual) under the Specified Parent Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employee participates for the years of continuous service by
such Continuing Employee recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time,  _provided, that,_ such credit (A) does not result in
a duplication of benefits, compensation, incentive or otherwise and (B) does
not result in an increase in the level of benefits beyond which a similarly
situated employee of Parent would be entitled. With respect to any welfare
benefit plans maintained by Parent for the benefit of Continuing Employees
located in the United States, subject to any applicable plan provisions,
contractual requirements or Legal Requirements, Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to: (A) cause to be waived any
eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations; and (B) give
effect, in determining any deductible maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to
amounts paid by such Continuing Employees with respect to substantially
similar plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries during the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 (b) If requested by Parent at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 (c) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Contemplated Transactions, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure that such notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not communicate with Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters, including post-Closing employee benefits and compensation, without the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

   

 (a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Acquired Corporations (" _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or in any indemnification agreement between an Acquired Corporation and an Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of an Acquired Corporation, as such agreement is in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, 

   ##### 

  

    

but only to the extent such rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses are available under and consistent with the laws of
the jurisdictions of the relevant Acquired Corporation. If, following the
Effective Time, Parent takes any action, or fails to take any action, that
results in the inability of the Company to satisfy its obligations under
this  _Section 5.5_, Parent shall thereafter be liable for the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section 5.5_. 

  

 (b) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former directors and officers of the Acquired Corporations than are set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, at no expense to the beneficiaries, either (i) maintain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Current D andO Insurance_") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Contemplated Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 250%, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions (subject to the foregoing) no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys and Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may and may cause the Subsidiaries to, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement; _provided_ , _that_ , the Company or Subsidiaries do not pay more than the Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, provided that Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, Parent shall be relieved from its obligations under the preceding two (2) sentences of this _Section 5.5(c)_. 

  

 (d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the persons referred to in this _Section 5.5_ in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this _Section 5.5_. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are intended to be in addition to, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, enforce and honor, to the fullest extent permitted by law for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Legal 

   ##### 

  

    

Requirement, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 (c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply as promptly as practicable with: (i) any inquiries or requests (including any "second request" for information) received from the Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice for additional information or documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters.

Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ , each party will promptly inform the

The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing or other submission made, each notice given and each Consent obtained by any Acquired Corporation during the Pre-Closing Period. 

  

 (e) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to: (i) contest, resist or resolve any such proceeding or action; and (ii) to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any injunction resulting from such proceeding or action, including, but not limited to, entering into negotiations withy any applicable Governmental Body. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation under this Agreement to take any of the following actions, if Parent determines in good faith that taking such actions would reasonably be expected to affect the business or interests of Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Corporations in any material adverse way: (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to dispose of or transfer any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available to any Person any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any Person any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to hold separate any assets or operations; or (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to make any commitment (to any

 (b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger has not been consummated by March 2, 2010 or any other date that Parent and the Company may agree upon in writing (the " _Outside Date_ ");  _provided, however,_ a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(b) _if the failure to consummate the Merger by the Outside Date is principally caused by the failure on the part of such party to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time; 

  

 (c) by either Parent or the Company, if a U.S., Australian or Irish court of competent jurisdiction or other U.S., Australian or Irish Governmental Body shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order, or shall have taken any other final and nonappealable action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; _provided, however,_ that (i) the party to this Agreement seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to resist or lift such Order; and (ii) a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ if the issuance of such Order is attributable to the failure of such party to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement; 

  

 (d) by either Parent or the Company, if: (i) the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements thereof) shall have been held and completed and the Company Stockholders shall have taken a final vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement; and (ii) this Agreement shall not have been adopted at the Company Stockholders Meeting (and shall not have been adopted at any adjournment or postponement thereof) by the Required Company Stockholder Vote;  _provided, however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(d)_ if the failure to have this Agreement adopted by the Required Company Stockholder Vote results from a failure on the part of such party to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time; 

  

 (e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote) if (i) a Company Triggering Event shall have occurred, or (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall no longer be unanimous, or any reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall not be unanimous; 

  

 (f) by Parent upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either case such that any of the conditions 

   ##### 

  

    

set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ would not be satisfied as of
the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty
shall have become untrue (it being understood that, for purposes of
determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date: (A) all "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and other materiality qualifications limiting the
scope of such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; and (B)
any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or
purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement shall
be disregarded); _provided, that,_ if any such breach of Companys
representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement or breach by the Company of a covenant or agreement is curable by
the Company within 30 days (but no later than the Outside Date) and the
Company is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such
breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(f)_ until the earlier of the date 30 days after delivery of written
notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or the Outside Date
(it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(f)_ if such breach by the Company is cured during such
period in a manner that does not result in a material breach of any covenant
of the Company); 

  

 (g) by the Company upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have become untrue, in either case such that any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date: (A) all "Parent Material Adverse Effect" and other materiality qualifications limiting the scope of such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; and (B) any update of or modification to the Parent Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded); _provided, that,_ if any such breach of Parents or Merger Subs representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or breach by Parent or Merger Sub of a covenant or agreement is curable by Parent or Merger Sub within 30 days (but no later than the Outside Date) and Parent or Merger Sub is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(g)_ until the earlier of the date 30 days after delivery of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach or the Outside Date (it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ if such breach by Parent or Merger Sub is cured during such period in a manner that does not result in a material breach of any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub); 

  

 (h) by the Company, if: (A) an offer that is a Superior Offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such offer was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a material breach by any Acquired Corporation of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, or as a direct or indirect result of a breach by any Acquired Corporation or any of its Representatives of any of the provisions set forth in _Section 4.3_; (C) the Company provides Parent, at least two Business Days prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which such board of directors will consider causing the Company to enter into a binding definitive acquisition agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes such Superior Offer (but not more than one Business Day after any director of the Company is first notified of such 

   ##### 

  

    

meeting), with a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting,
the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of such
Superior Offer (including a copy of any draft definitive agreement relating
to such Superior Offer to the extent such a draft definitive agreement
exists) and the identity of the Person making such Superior Offer; (D) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that, in light of such Superior
Offer, the failure to terminate this Agreement in order to permit the Company
to enter into such binding definitive acquisition agreement would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (E) such binding
definitive acquisition agreement is not entered into at any time within the
period of three Business Days after Parent receives written notice from the
Company confirming that the Company Board has determined that the failure to
terminate this Agreement in order to permit the Company to enter into such
binding definitive acquisition agreement would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements; (F) during such three Business
Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
offer that was determined to constitute a Superior Offer no longer
constitutes a Superior Offer or that no termination of this Agreement in order
to permit the Company to enter into such binding definitive acquisition
agreement is required as a result of such offer; and (G) at the end of such
three Business Day period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
that the failure to terminate this Agreement in order to permit the Company
to enter into such binding definitive acquisition agreement would continue to
be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of
the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements in light of such Superior Offer (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement or any alternative transaction
proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(F)"
or otherwise); _provided, that,_ for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
may provide the notices required by _Section 5.2(c)(i)_ and this _Section
8.1(h)_ concurrently and the five and three day notice periods required by
such respective sections may run concurrently; or 

  

 (i) by Parent if a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred following the date of this Agreement. 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.1_,
this Agreement may not be terminated by any party unless any fee required to
be paid (or caused to be paid) by such party at or prior to the time of such
termination pursuant to _Section 8.4_ shall have been paid in full. 

   

 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; _provided, however,_  that: (i) this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_, and _Section 9_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, and (iii) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any intentional or willful and material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision contained in this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 8.3 Expenses. Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid (or caused to be paid) by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, then the Company shall as promptly as practicable in light of the Companys then-current cash position (but in any event within 60 Business Days following such termination) reimburse Parent for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all attorneys fees, accountants fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees) that have been incurred or paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i) in connection with the preparation, negotiation and performance of this Agreement and all related agreements and documents, (ii) in connection with the due diligence investigation conducted with respect to the Acquired Corporations, and (iii) in connection with all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to a maximum of $2,000,000. 

   

 8.4 Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated: (a) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ ; (b) pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (i) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made and not withdrawn, at least five Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) by the first anniversary of such termination, either (A) the Company consummates a Specified Acquisition Transaction or (B) the Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to a Specified Acquisition Transaction and, following such first anniversary, the Specified Acquisition Transaction to which such definitive agreement relates (or any other Specified Acquisition Transaction among or involving the parties to such definitive agreement or any of such parties affiliates) is consummated; or (c) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_; then the Company shall pay Parent a nonrefundable fee equal to $10,000,000 _minus_ any amount actually previously paid by the Company to Parent as reimbursement pursuant to _Section 8.3_. Such fee shall be paid in immediately available funds and shall be due and payable on the date that is (A) two (2) Business Days after the date of termination in the event of a termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, (B) on or prior to the date on which the applicable Specified Acquisition Transaction is consummated in the event of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, or (C) prior to the effectiveness of any termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_. " _Specified Acquisition Transaction_ " shall have the same meaning as the term "Acquisition Transaction," except that, solely for purposes of the definition of Specified Acquisition Transaction, all references to "15%" or "85%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to refer instead to "50%". If the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under _Section 8.3_ or this _Section 8.4_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of legal counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by Parent of its rights under _Section 8.3_ or this _Section 8.4_, and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such amount was originally required to be paid. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 9\. Miscellaneous Provisions 

  

 9.1 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended with the approval of Parent and the Companys respective boards of directors at any time (whether before or after this Agreement is adopted by the Company Stockholders); _provided, however,_ that after any such adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, no amendment shall be made which pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements requires further approval of the Company Stockholders without the further approval of the Company Stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties to this Agreement. 

   

 9.2 Extension; Waiver. 

   

 (a) Subject to _Sections 9.2(b)_ and _9.2(c)_ , at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub on the one hand and the Company on the other hand may: (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party; (ii) waive any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the other party in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) waive compliance with any covenant, obligation or condition for the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. The agreement of Parent to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Merger Sub to such extension or waiver. 

  

 (b) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. 

  

 (c) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. 

  

 9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. 

   

 9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts; Exchanges by Facsimile or Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and the other agreements, exhibits and disclosure schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof;  _provided, however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully 

   ##### 

  

   

executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 9.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions: (a) each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware; and (b) each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury. 

   

 9.6 Attorneys Fees. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit. 

   

 9.7 Assignability; No Third Party Rights. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither this Agreement nor any partys rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties shall be void and of no effect, _provided, however_ , that either or both Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ( _provided, that,_ no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any obligation it may have hereunder). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the parties to this Agreement) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except that, from and after the Effective Time, the provisions of _Section 1_ shall be for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock, and the provisions of _Section 5.5_ shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties. In the event that the Company brings a Legal Proceeding for monetary damages for breach of this Agreement in which it is held that the right to obtain such monetary damages (including damages based on the loss of economic benefits of the Contemplated Transactions to the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants, if determined appropriate) is solely held by the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants, then such rights of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants may be enforced on their behalf by the Company as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants.

 9.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such 

   ##### 

  

   

term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it
in the prior sentence, the parties agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision. 

   

 9.10 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. Because the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if a provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek and obtain, if available, an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and the parties hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein. 

   

 9.11 Construction. 

   

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. 

  

 (b) The parties agree that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

 (d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits or Schedules to this Agreement. 

  

 (e) The bold-faced headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) For purposes of _Section 8_, references to the failure of a party to perform its covenants or obligations in this Agreement shall, in the case of Parent, include the failure of Merger Sub to perform its covenants or obligations in this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (g) To the extent this Agreement refers to information or documents to be made available, delivered, produced or provided by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied such obligation if the Company has made such information or document available by (i) posting such information or document at least two Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (or such shorter period as may be specified by email notice by the Company or its Representative to Parent or its Representative prior to the date of this Agreement, with respect to any specific information or documents posted within such two day period) to the "electronic data room" maintained by the Company and accessible by Parent or any of its Representatives for purposes of the Contemplated Transactions or (ii) delivering such information or document to Parent or its Representatives at least two Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement.
