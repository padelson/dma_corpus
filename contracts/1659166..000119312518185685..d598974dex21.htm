Re: Final Binding Offer

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



   1. | _Submission of Offer_. Fortive Corporation (" _Buyer_ ") is
pleased to submit this final, binding and irrevocable offer (this " _Offer_ ")
to Ethicon, Inc. (" _Seller_ ") for the acquisition of the Transferred Assets
and Transferred Equity Interests, and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, of the Business (in each case, as defined in the Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement referred to below) as a going concern (the " _Acquisition_
"), on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the Stock and
Asset Purchase Agreement attached to this Offer as _Exhibit 1_ and duly
executed and delivered by Buyer (including the Schedules and Exhibits
thereto, the " _Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used
in this Offer shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. Buyer hereby confirms
that if the Principal Closing Date occurred on the date hereof, the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ of the Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement would be satisfied and that Buyer will not take any action prior to
the earlier of (x) the Offer Acceptance (as defined below) and (y) the Offer
Termination Time (as defined below) which would cause such conditions to not
be satisfied. Buyer hereby further agrees that it will comply with, and will
cause its Affiliates that are or will be parties to any Transaction Document
to comply with, the covenants set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ and  _Section_
__ _ 8.01(a)_ of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement during the period
from the date of this Offer to the Offer Termination Time (or, if this Offer
is accepted by Seller in the manner contemplated herein, to the time as set
forth in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement). 
---|--- 



   2. | _Offer Termination Time_. This Offer will remain valid until
11:59 P.M., New York time, on the earlier of (a) the second business day after
the date on which each of the Specified Consultation Processes (as defined
below) have concluded, or are deemed to have concluded according to applicable
Law, and (b) October 4, 2018; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Specified
Consultation Processes have not concluded, or are not deemed to have
concluded according to applicable Law, by such date and Buyer or Seller, as
the case may be, shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations with respect to the Specified Consultation Processes pursuant to 
_paragraph_ __ _ 7_ below, then Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be
permitted to extend this date from time to time in consecutive increments of
up to 30 days each, but in any event not beyond 11:59 P.M., New York time, on
March 26, 2019 (this time, as such time may be so extended by Buyer or Seller,
the " _Offer Termination Time_ "). The party extending the Offer Termination
Time shall provide notice to the other party of any extension of the Offer
Termination Time no later than one business day prior to the then current
Offer Termination Time. 
---|--- 



   3. |

_Offer Acceptance and Extension_. Seller may accept this Offer by executing
and delivering to Buyer a countersignature to the Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement no later than the Offer Termination Time. 
 Asset Purchase Agreement may be made by Seller to Buyer in accordance with the
notice provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ of the Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement (the " _Offer Acceptance_ "). Seller agrees that, no later
than the second business day after the date on which each of the Specified
Consultation Processes have concluded, or are deemed to have concluded
according to applicable Law, Seller shall promptly make a decision whether or
not to accept the Offer, and following such decision, Seller shall promptly
communicate such decision to Buyer and, in the event such decision is to
accept the Offer, promptly deliver the Offer Acceptance. For purposes of this
Offer, the information and/or consultation processes with the competent
employees representative bodies of Seller and its Affiliates in connection
with the Acquisition are collectively referred to as the " _Consultation
Processes_ "; the Consultation Processes in the jurisdictions specified in
_Exhibit_ __ _ 2_ are referred to as the " _Specified Consultation
Processes_ ". 
---|--- 



   4. | _Acknowledgement_. Buyer hereby confirms to Seller that this
Offer is binding in accordance with its terms and, except in the event of
termination of this Offer pursuant to _paragraph 8_ below, may not be revoked
by Buyer in any respect or for any reason (other than in the case of a breach
by Seller of the terms of _paragraph_ __ _ 5_ below) prior to the Offer
Termination Time. Each of Seller and Buyer hereby acknowledges that the other
party is relying on this Offer and the promises, representations, warranties
and covenants contained herein. 
---|--- 



   5. | _Exclusivity_. 
---|--- 



     | a. | Seller hereby agrees that, during the period beginning on the
date hereof and continuing until the earlier of (x) the Offer Acceptance and
(y) the Offer Termination Time, Seller will not, nor will it permit any of
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Company) and its and their
respective directors, officers or employees, or any attorney, accountant or
other representative retained by any of them (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information),
or take any other action designed or reasonably likely to facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal (as defined below), (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with respect to, any
Alternative Proposal or (iii) enter into or approve any agreement with
respect to any Alternative Proposal. None of Seller nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Company) shall release any third party from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement with respect to
the Business to which it is a party and which was entered into with respect
to any potential Alternative Proposal. Seller and its Affiliates shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to, with respect to third parties
with whom discussions or negotiations with respect to an Alternative Proposal
have been terminated on or prior to the date of this Offer, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the return or destruction of, in accordance with the
terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, confidential information
previously furnished by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or its or their
Representatives, with respect to the Business and shall promptly terminate all
physical and electronic database access previously granted to each such third
party. Seller will promptly notify Buyer orally (and then in writing within 24
hours) after it or any of its Affiliates has received any proposal, inquiry,
offer or request relating to or constituting, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, any request for discussions or
negotiations, or any request for information relating to the Business in
connection with an Alternative Proposal or a potential Alternative Proposal
or for access to the properties or books and records thereof in connection
with an Alternative Proposal of which Seller or any of its Affiliates is or
becomes aware, or any amendments to the foregoing. Such notice to Buyer shall
indicate the identity of the person making such proposal and the terms and
conditions of such proposal, if any. Seller shall also promptly provide Buyer
with (A) a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any
person informing Seller or any of its Affiliates that it is considering
making, or has made a proposal regarding, an Alternative Proposal, (B) a copy
of any Alternative Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by Seller or
any of its Affiliates and (C) such other details of any such Alternative
Proposal that Buyer may reasonably request. Thereafter, Seller shall promptly
keep Buyer reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal.  
---|---|--- 
 



2 _Alternative Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any
expression of interest by any third party relating to Sellers or any of its
Affiliates willingness or ability to receive or discuss a proposal or offer,
other than a proposal or offer by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for any
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, acquisition or other business combination, in each
case relating to 25% or more of the assets of the Business. 
---|---|--- 



   6. | _Publicity_. With respect to this Offer and the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer and
Seller each hereby agree to comply with the restrictions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.04_ of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, without limiting either partys ability to make such
disclosures as may be required by applicable Law, in connection with the
Consultation Processes Seller may make available to the applicable employees
representative bodies of Seller and its Affiliates such information as Seller
determines is reasonably necessary to effect such Consultation Processes.  
---|--- 



   7. | _Consultation Process; Representations; Covenants._ 
---|--- 



     | a. | Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply in
all material respects with all appropriate requirements and procedures in
connection with the Consultation Processes and shall convene meetings of the
competent employees representative bodies as soon as reasonably practicable
with a view to obtaining expeditious delivery of the opinions of such
competent employees representative bodies. Seller shall keep Buyer regularly
informed of the status of matters relating to the delivery of such opinions,
including furnishing Buyer promptly with copies of notices or details of any
substantive material communications obtained by Seller, whether orally or in
writing, as part of the Consultation Processes. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Seller undertakes to inform Buyer in writing as
soon as possible (and in any event no later than two business days) after any
Consultation Process has concluded, or is deemed to have concluded according
to applicable Law; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything in this Offer or
in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall not
enter into any agreements, understandings or commitments with, or for the
benefit of, the employees representative bodies of Seller and its Affiliates,
that could reasonably be expected to result in any liability to Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Company) on or following the
Applicable Closing Date prior to providing Buyer with reasonable notice and
obtaining Buyers consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | Without limiting the generality of _paragraph 1_ of this
Offer, Buyer hereby agrees to cooperate and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Seller (as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ of the Stock
and Asset Purchase Agreement) in effecting the Consultation Processes,
including providing such information (including information in respect of
Buyers employee benefit plans, if any) to, and attending such meetings with,
the applicable employees representative bodies, in each case as may be
required by applicable Law or practices or as may be reasonably requested by
Seller or such employees representative bodies or their respective agents or
advisors in connection with the Consultation Processes. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Seller agrees that it will comply with, and will cause its
Affiliates that are or will be parties to any Transaction Document to comply
with, the covenants set forth in _Article VI_ (subject to _paragraph 6_  of
this Offer) and _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_ of the Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement during the period from the date of this Offer to the Offer
Termination Time (or, if this Offer is accepted by Seller in the manner
contemplated herein, to the time as set forth in the Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement). 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Seller hereby confirms that, if the Principal Closing Date
occurred on the date hereof, the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.01(a)_ of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement would be satisfied, and
Seller hereby agrees to not take any action prior to the earlier of (x) the
Offer Acceptance and (y) the Offer Termination Time which would cause such
condition to not be satisfied. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8. | _Termination_. This Offer may be terminated: 
---|--- 
 



3 ---|---|--- 



     | b. | by Buyer, by written notice to Seller (such notice to be
delivered in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.07_ of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement), at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance, if Seller shall have breached in any material respect any of
Sellers covenants or agreements contained in _clause_ __ _ (a)_ of
_paragraph_ __ _ 5_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer may only terminate
this Offer pursuant to this _clause_ __ _ (b)_ if at the time of termination
Buyer is not in breach in any material respect of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Offer. 
---|---|--- 



   9. | _Termination Fees_. 
---|--- 



     | a. | If (i) this Offer is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _clause
(b)_ of _paragraph_ __ _ 8_ or (ii) (A) any Person shall have made an
Alternative Proposal after the date hereof but prior to the Offer Termination
Time, (B) Seller fails to deliver the Offer Acceptance by the Offer
Termination Time and (C) within twelve months after the Offer Termination
Time, Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Alternative Proposal or shall have consummated a
transaction contemplated by any Alternative Proposal, then, in each of the
cases of _clause_ __ _ (i)_ or _(ii)_ , Seller shall pay to Buyer, in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Buyer, an amount equal to 4.0% of the Purchase Price (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _clause_
__ _ (i)_ shall be made no later than five business days following the
termination of this Offer by Buyer, and payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (ii)_ shall be made no later than five business
days following the earlier of the date on which Seller or its Affiliate
executes the definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative Proposal or
the date on which Seller or its Affiliate consummates any
transaction contemplated by any Alternative Proposal. In the event that
Seller shall have made the Expense Reimbursement payment to Buyer pursuant to
_paragraph_ __ _ 9(b)_ below, then the amount of any Termination Fee shall be
reduced by the amount of such Expense Reimbursement payment. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | If the Offer Acceptance has not been made for any reason
prior to the Offer Termination Time, Seller shall promptly (but in any event
not more than five business days following the Offer Termination Time) pay to
Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account
designated in writing by Buyer, an amount of cash in respect of Buyers
expenses equal to 1.0% of the Purchase Price (the " _Expense Reimbursement_
").  
---|---|--- 



     | c. | The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _paragraph 9_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Offer, and that, without these agreements, neither
Seller nor Buyer would have entered into this Offer. Accordingly, if Seller
fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this _paragraph_ __ _ 9_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences any action which results
in an award of, or a judgment against Seller for, the Termination Fee or the
Expense Reimbursement (or any portion thereof), Seller shall pay Buyers
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of enforcement) in connection with such action. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that this Offer terminates because (i) the Specified Consultation Processes
shall not have concluded, or shall not be deemed to have concluded
according to applicable Law, by the Offer Termination Time, and (ii) (x)
Buyer has breached its obligations with respect to the Specified Consultation
Processes pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (b)_ of  _paragraph_ __ _ 7_, and (y)
such breach by Buyer was the proximate cause of the failure of the Specified
Consultation Processes to conclude, or to be deemed to conclude according to
applicable Law, by the Offer Termination Time (and Seller shall have complied
with its obligations with respect to such Specified Consultation Processes),
then Buyer shall not be entitled to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to
_clause_ __ _ (ii)_ of  _paragraph_ __ _ 9(a)_ or the Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to _paragraph_ __ _ 9(b)_. 
---|---|--- 



   10. |

and Seller hereby agree that, upon acceptance of the Offer and the execution
and delivery of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement by Seller, (x) the date
of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement as used therein shall be deemed to
be the date hereof  

---|--- 
 



4 treated for all purposes as if executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller on

at a later date. Buyer and Seller hereby agree, as permitted by applicable
Law, to commence the filing and obtaining of consents, approvals,

other third parties as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ of the Stock and
Asset Purchase Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof. 
---|--- 
 



   11. | _Governing Law and Dispute Resolution_. This Offer, and all
claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Offer or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Offer, shall be governed by the
Law of the State of New York without reference to any provisions thereof that
would require the application of the Law of any other jurisdiction. Any
dispute, claim or controversy arising from or related in any way to this
Offer or the interpretation, application, breach, termination or validity

forth herein. The provisions set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 11.04_ through

Buyer or any of its Affiliates any portion of the Business or to execute the
Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement or any other agreements in respect of the
Acquisition, and, subject to _paragraph_ __ _ 9_ of this Offer, Seller shall

SECTION 1.02. _Interpretation and Construction_. (a) Unless otherwise provided
herein all monetary values stated herein are expressed in United States
currency and all references to "U.S. dollars", "dollars" or "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States.

 

(b) Each accounting term set forth herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meaning accorded it under GAAP. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
of any discrepancy between GAAP and the provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control.

 

(c) Except as provided in Section 2.03(b), whenever conversion of values from
any Foreign Currency for a particular date or period shall be required, such
conversion shall be made using the closing rate provided by Bloomberg at 5:00
P.M. New York City time three business days prior to the applicable date or
dates (the " _Exchange Rate_ ").

 

(d) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to a party or to a Section, Exhibit or Annex, such reference
shall be to a party to, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Annex to, this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Schedule with respect to a particular Section, such reference
shall be to a

 



16  Schedule to the Disclosure Letter with respect to such Section, unless
otherwise indicated. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have their
defined meanings when used in any Exhibit or Annex to this Agreement or any
Schedule to the Disclosure Letter or any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined therein. Whenever used in
this Agreement, "business day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or a
Sunday or a day on which banking and savings and loan institutions are
authorized or required by applicable Law to be closed in the State of New York
or in the country of the applicable Country Unit. Whenever the
words "include", "includes", "including" or "such as" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect as the word "shall". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". Whenever used in
this Agreement, any noun or pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as
well as the singular and to cover all genders. Any agreement, instrument or
statute defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, supplemented or modified, including (i)
(in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the
case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and (ii) all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. The words "asset"
and "property" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and permitted
assigns. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any Country
Transfer Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

expected to be available and the financial reporting requirements of the SEC
that are applicable to Buyer, in no event shall the Principal Closing take
place before December 1, 2018. The date on which the Principal Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Principal Closing Date_ ". The
Principal Closing and each Non-Principal Country Unit Closing shall be deemed
to take effect at 12:01 A.M., local time (in each Principal Country Unit and
each Non-Principal Country Unit, as applicable), on the Principal Closing
Date

 



17  or the Non-Principal Country Unit Closing Date, as applicable; _provided_
that, with respect to the United States, the Principal Closing shall
be deemed to take effect at 12:01 A.M. Pacific Time and, if the local time in
any other Country Unit includes more than one time zone, the Applicable
Closing of such Country Unit shall be deemed to take effect at 12:01 A.M.,
local time of the capital city of such Country Unit. The parties hereto
specifically acknowledge that time is of the essence because Sellers
intention to exit the Business is or will become known to its employees,
customers, suppliers and others having dealings with Seller.

(b) The closing of the transfer of the Transferred Assets relating to
each Non-Principal Country Unit and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
relating to such Non-Principal Country Unit will occur as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Principal Closing Date on the date agreed to by Buyer
and Seller within the period specified in _Exhibit D_ to the Transition
Services Agreement, but in no event before the third business day following
the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver) of
the conditions set forth in Article V with respect to such Non-Principal
Country Unit (excluding those conditions intended to be satisfied at such
Closing but subject to their satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver at such time) (each such date, a " _Non-Principal
Country Unit Closing Date_"). During the period from the Principal Closing
Date until the occurrence of the applicable Non-Principal Country Unit
Closing, none of the assets or liabilities of the applicable Non-
Principal Country Unit shall be transferred to or assumed by Buyer, as the
case may be, and Seller shall hold and operate such Non-Principal Country Unit
in a manner consistent with Sellers obligations under this Section 2.01 and
under Section 6.01. The parties shall enter into a distribution arrangement
giving effect to the foregoing with respect to such Non-Principal Country Unit
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

SECTION 2.02. _Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests/Excluded
Assets; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities_. (a) Transferred Assets and Transferred
Equity Interests. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Applicable Closing, Seller will, and will
cause the relevant Asset Selling Affiliates to, sell, convey, assign and
transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept, the
Transferred Assets related to the applicable Country Unit(s), free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Accordingly, (i) Seller will, or
will cause the relevant Asset Selling Affiliates to, execute and deliver at
the Principal Closing a general assignment and bill of sale in the form of
Exhibit B (the " _General Assignment_ "), a general patent assignment in the
form of Exhibit C (the " _Patent Assignment_ ") and a general trademark
assignment in the form of Exhibit D (the " _Trademark Assignment_ ") and at
each Applicable Closing such other instruments of conveyance, assignment and
transfer as Buyer reasonably requests (the " _Additional Assignments_ "), in
each case to convey to Buyer all of Sellers or each Asset Selling Affiliates
right, title and interest in and to the applicable Transferred Assets and
(ii) Buyer will execute and deliver at the Principal Closing counterparts to
the General Assignment, the Patent Assignment and the Trademark Assignment and
at each Applicable Closing counterparts to the Additional Assignments. In
addition, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Principal Closing, Seller will sell, convey, assign and
transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept,
the Transferred Equity Interests, free and clear of all Liens other than
transfer restrictions under applicable securities Laws. Accordingly, Seller
will deliver at the Principal Closing stock certificates representing the
Transferred Equity Interests (if such Transferred

 



18  Equity Interests are certificated), together with a stock power endorsed in
blank or other appropriate instrument of assignment in respect of the
Transferred Equity Interests. All risk of loss with respect to the
Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity Interests (whether or not covered by
insurance) shall be on Seller up to the time of the Applicable Closing,
whereupon such risk of loss with respect to the Transferred Assets
or Transferred Equity Interests conveyed at such Closing shall pass to Buyer.
For the avoidance of doubt, at the Principal Closing, by means of the
acquisition of the Transferred Equity Interests and not by means of a direct
acquisition of such assets by Buyer, Buyer shall acquire the Transferred
Assets of the Transferred Company.

(b) _Excluded Assets_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer
is not purchasing, pursuant to this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements
or any of the Transactions, Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) right, title
or interest in any asset that is not a Transferred Asset or Transferred
Equity Interest. Specifically, Sellers (and any of its Affiliates) right,
title or interest in any Excluded Asset is not being conveyed to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates.

 

(c) _Assumed Liabilities_. At the Applicable Closing, Buyer shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Unit(s) and shall agree
to satisfy and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities related to the
applicable Country Unit(s). After the Applicable Closing, Buyer shall pay all
Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Unit(s) as and when
such liabilities become due. Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller at the
Principal Closing an assumption agreement in the form of _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Assumption Agreement_ ") and at each Non-Principal Country Unit Closing such
other assumption agreements substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_
with such changes as may be required by local Law (the "
_Additional Assumptions_ "), whereby Buyer agrees to assume and undertakes to
pay, perform and discharge as and when due, the Assumed Liabilities related to
the applicable Country Unit(s). Seller will, or will cause the relevant Asset
Selling Affiliates to, execute and deliver to Buyer at the Principal Closing
a counterpart to the Assumption Agreement and at each Non-Principal Country
Unit Closing counterparts to the Additional Assumptions. For the avoidance of
doubt, at the Principal Closing, by means of the acquisition of the
Transferred Equity Interests and not by means of a direct assumption of such
liabilities by Buyer, Buyer shall be responsible for the liabilities of the
Transferred Company that would otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities
pursuant to _Annex 2.02(c)_.

(d) _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise
discharge any Excluded Liability. Seller and its Affiliates, as the case may
be, will remain liable to pay, perform and discharge when due, all Excluded
Liabilities.

(e)  _Country Transfer Agreements_. To the extent required by applicable Law,
the transfer of each Country Unit will be effected pursuant to a short-form
agreement or one or more instruments of transfer, such as a bill of sale,
share transfer agreement, business transfer agreement, real estate transfer
agreement or other asset assignment document, which agreement shall be
prepared by Seller and shall be on terms mutually agreed between the parties
consistent with the applicable terms of this Agreement and in the form of
_Exhibit F_ ,

 



19  with only such mutually agreed changes as may be required by local Law
(each, a " _Country Transfer Agreement_ "). If required, the parties shall
enter into the Country Transfer Agreements as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof and not later than the Applicable Closing.

(f)  _Designation of Affiliates_. To the extent that any of the Transferred
Assets or Transferred Equity Interests are under the control of any of
Sellers Affiliates, Seller shall cause its Affiliates to promptly take such
legal action as may be necessary to consummate the transfer to Buyer and its
Affiliates of such Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity Interests under
terms and conditions which are consistent with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement. Prior to, and in any event at least 30 days in advance of,
any Applicable Closing, Buyer may designate after reasonable consultation with
Seller, one or more Affiliates to, at the Applicable Closing, (i) acquire all
or part of the Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity Interests, (ii)
assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities or (iii) pay a designated
portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.03, in each case related
to the applicable Country Unit(s), as the case may be, in which event all
references herein to Buyer will be deemed to refer to such Affiliates, as
appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such designation will in any
event limit or affect the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement to
the extent not performed by such Affiliates.

(g) _Transferred Assets Subject to Third-Party Consent_. To the extent
that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) of any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals
(including Anti-Trust Approvals), consents or waivers and such authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the
Applicable Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, thereof. For a period of 18 months after the
Applicable Closing Date, the parties shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts (i) to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and to give any notices
required for the transfer of such Transferred Asset and (ii) to obtain from
third parties an approval or consent to establish a new contract with Buyer
or its designated Affiliate with respect to the portion of any Commingled
Contact related to the Business, the Business Interests in respect of which
were not transferred to Buyer at the Applicable Closing, pursuant to which
Buyer or its designated Affiliate will have access to the rights and benefits
of such portion of such Commingled Contract on substantially the same terms
and conditions provided to Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Applicable
Closing, or to assign such portion to Buyer or its designated Affiliate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be required to pay any
consideration or make any concession (other than customary filing and
application fees typically paid by a seller or transferee) therefor. If such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained, Seller shall promptly
assign, transfer, convey or deliver any such Transferred Asset or, if
applicable, that portion of any Commingled Contract, as the case may be, in
each case, to Buyer at no additional cost. Pending the earlier of obtaining
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver or the expiration of such 18
month period, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to
Buyer all economic benefits and burdens of any

 



20  such Transferred Asset. During such time period, Seller and its applicable
Affiliates shall comply with all applicable covenants and obligations with
respect to such Transferred Asset, including the payment of any costs or
expenses in connection therewith, which shall be performed by Seller or its
applicable Affiliate for Buyers account and Buyer shall promptly (but in no
event later than 30 days following receipt of an invoice from Seller)
reimburse Seller for any such out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments made
by Seller or its applicable Affiliate in respect of such Transferred Asset.
Subject to Sellers compliance with this Section 2.02(g), Buyer further
agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained in
this Agreement shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to
Buyers obligations to close the Transactions shall be deemed not satisfied
solely as a result of the failure to obtain any such authorization, approval,
consent or waiver (it being understood that this sentence shall not be deemed
to impair the rights of Buyer in respect of any breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.07).

(h) _Buyer_ __ _s Recording and Similar Responsibilities_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02, it shall be Buyers
responsibility (i) to prepare the applicable country patent assignments,
trademark assignments, copyright assignments and domain name transfers from
Seller or its applicable Asset Selling Affiliates to Buyer and to record such
assignments and transfers following execution thereof by Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate), (ii) to apply for its own marketing authorizations for
the Products to the relevant regulatory authorities where it is not within the
power of Seller to cause, by giving notice to the applicable regulatory
authority, the transfer directly to Buyer (or to a third-party designee of
Buyer) of the existing marketing authorizations that are Transferred Assets,
(iii) to bear the fees and other costs in connection with recording
instruments related to the Transferred Real Property Leases and (iv) to bear
the fees and other costs in accordance with Section 2.06(d) and Taxes
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes based on the net income of
Seller) arising from such activities.

 

(i) _Japan Corporate Split_. Seller may elect (on notice to Buyer no later
than 45 days after the date of this Agreement) to effect the sale,
conveyance, assignment and transfer to Buyer of the Transferred Assets
relating to Japan and the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities
relating to Japan, in each case on the Applicable Closing Date, by way of
an "absorption-type company split" pursuant to Japan Corporate-Split Law. If
Seller so elects, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
execute and deliver a Country Transfer Agreement or other document, the form
and substance of which shall be mutually agreed between the parties (it being
understood that, in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any
Country Transfer Agreement or other document, the terms of this Agreement
shall control) providing for the transfer of the Transferred Assets relating
to Japan to a newly formed wholly owned Subsidiary (" _Japan NewCo_ ") of
either Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (it being understood that Buyer may
request, subject to Sellers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), that such Subsidiary be a Japanese Godo Gaisha) and
for the assumption by Japan NewCo of the Assumed Liabilities relating to
Japan, and to take such other actions, as may be necessary or desirable to
give effect to the foregoing, including, if applicable, amending the
definition of "Transferred Company" to also include Japan NewCo, in which case
Japan NewCo shall be deemed to be a Transferred Company for all purposes
hereof and Seller shall update any applicable Annexes and Schedules as
necessary to reflect the inclusion of Japan NewCo as a Transferred Company.

 



21  Any Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) resulting from such absorption-type
company split shall be borne by Seller. In the event that Seller (or its
Affiliate) forms Japan NewCo as a Godo Gaisha, Seller shall, or shall cause
such Affiliate of Seller that is the owner of Japan NewCo to, elect timely
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(a) for Japan NewCo,
effective at the time of its formation, to be disregarded as an entity
separate from its owner for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes. In the event
that Seller (or its Affiliate) forms Japan NewCo as a Kabushiki Gaisha, Buyer
shall, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, be permitted to make
an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any comparable election
under state or local Tax Law) with respect to the acquisition of Japan NewCo.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Principal Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause one or
more of its Affiliates as Buyer may designate pursuant to Section 2.02(f) to)
pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller
may designate), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or
more bank accounts designated in writing by Seller at least two business days
prior to the Principal Closing Date, cash in U.S. dollars (subject to Section
2.03(b)) in an amount exclusive of any Transfer Taxes equal to (i)
$2,700,000,000  _plus_ (ii) the aggregate Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount (the
sum of clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 

(b) Buyer shall pay the portion of the Purchase Price applicable to the
Country Units identified on _Schedule 2.03(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter (as
allocated to such Country Units pursuant to the Allocation) in the applicable
Foreign Currency set forth on such _Schedule 2.03(b)_. The conversion rate
from U.S. dollars to the applicable Foreign Currency shall be the closing
rate provided by Bloomberg at 5:00 P.M. New York City time three business days
prior to the Principal Closing Date. In the event that the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to any Non-Principal Country Unit pursuant to the
Allocation is required by applicable Law to be paid in a Foreign Currency and
the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Country Unit pursuant to
the Allocation was previously paid by Buyer in U.S. dollars, (i) on the
Applicable Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates will pay to Seller an amount
in the applicable Foreign Currency equal to (x) the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to such Non-Principal Country Unit pursuant to the Allocation
in U.S. dollars multiplied by (y) the Exchange Rate with respect to each
Foreign Currency determined based on the closing rate provided by Bloomberg
at 5:00 P.M. New York City time three business days prior to the Applicable
Closing Date and (ii) upon receipt of Buyers or its Affiliates payment
pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i) Seller or its Affiliates
shall refund to Buyer the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such
Country Unit pursuant to pursuant to the Allocation in U.S. dollars.

 

(c) The Purchase Price shall be subject to the adjustment provisions of
Section 2.04 and shall be allocated as described in Section 2.05.

(d) No later than five business days prior to the Principal Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement (in its draft form, the "
_Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith estimate of the
Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount and reasonably detailed documentation evidencing
Sellers calculation of the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount as set forth in the
Estimated Statement.

 



22 SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) For the purposes of
clarification only, Seller is retaining all accounts payable and accounts
receivable with respect to each Country Unit arising out of the operation and
conduct of the Business before the Applicable Closing Date for such Country
Unit and the only purchase price adjustment with respect to changes in the
working capital of the Business after any Closing will be the adjustments
pursuant to this Section 2.04.

 

(b) Within 120 days after the Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement in the form of _Schedule_ __ _ 2.04(b)_ (in
its draft form, the " _Price Adjustment Statement_ "), setting forth its
calculation as of the Applicable Closing Date of the actual (i) Closing
Inventory for such applicable Country Units and (ii) only in the case of the
Principal Closing Date, the Prepaid Tax Amount (the " _Final Prepaid Tax
Amount_ "). To the extent that the Closing Inventory, with respect to the
applicable Country Unit (once final and binding pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.04(f)) is greater than the applicable Inventory Target, with respect
to such applicable Country Units, or less than the applicable Inventory
Target, with respect to such applicable Country Units, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as described in Section 2.04(f) below. To the extent that
the Final Prepaid Tax Amount (once final and binding pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.04) is greater than the Estimated Prepaid Tax
Amount or less than the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as described in Section 2.04(g) below.

 

(c) In connection with the preparation of each Price Adjustment Statement,
Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to assist, Seller, its
accountants, advisors and other representatives in its preparation of each
Price Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to Seller, its accountants, advisors
and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to
the personnel, properties, books and records of the Business in the possession
of Buyer or its Affiliates (and its and their accountants, subject to
executing customary access letters) to the extent relevant to the preparation
of any Price Adjustment Statement (including any taking and preparing of
physical counts of Inventory). For purposes of this Section 2.04, the
calculation of book value of the Inventory will be determined in a manner
consistent with Sellers inventory and other relevant accounting policies
used in the preparation of the 2015/2016/2017 Draft Financial Statements, as
set forth in _Schedule 2.04(c)_ (collectively, the " _Accounting Policies_ ").

 

(d) Each Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the 30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives
written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller
on or prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted. If a
timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the relevant Price
Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below)
shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x) the
date the parties hereto resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date
any matters in dispute are resolved in writing by an accounting firm
(in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Section 2.04) selected by

 



23  Seller and Buyer or, if the parties are unable to agree, an independent
accounting firm selected by Sellers and Buyers independent accounting firms
(such firm, the " _Accounting Firm_ ").

(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in Section 11.12 shall not apply to any dispute
described in this Section 2.04. During the 30-day period immediately following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day
period, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and resolution by the
Accounting Firm any and all matters which remain in dispute and which were
included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Accounting Firm shall make a
final determination in writing of the values set forth on the relevant
Price Adjustment Statement (and shall use such determination to prepare the
relevant final Price Adjustment Statement), which determination shall be
binding on the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the scope of such
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to: (i) those matters
that remain in dispute and that were included in the Notice of Disagreement,
(ii) whether, for each calculation of Inventory and the Prepaid Tax Amount,
such calculation was prepared in accordance with this Section 2.04, and
specifically, whether, in the case of Inventory, the Accounting Policies were
used, and (iii) whether there were mathematical errors in the relevant Price
Adjustment Statement, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted
to make any other determination. The parties shall jointly request that the
Accounting Firm render a written decision resolving the matters set forth in
this Section 2.04(e) within 30 days after such submission. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Accounting Firm is not authorized or
permitted to make any determination as to the accuracy of Section 3.06 or any
other representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by
Seller or any of its Affiliates with any of the covenants in this Agreement
(other than this Section 2.04). The relevant Price Adjustment Statement shall
become final and binding on Buyer and Seller on the date the Accounting
Firm delivers in writing the relevant final Price Adjustment Statement to the
parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
2.04 shall be borne one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

(f) If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the book value of the
applicable Closing Inventory exceeds the applicable Inventory Target, then
the amount of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the
Purchase Price. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the book
value of the applicable Closing Inventory is less than the applicable
Inventory Target, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount of such deficit. If the Price Adjustment Statement
discloses that the book value of the applicable Closing Inventory is equal
to the applicable Inventory Target, then there shall be no adjustment to the
Purchase Price in respect of the Applicable Closing.

 

(g) If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Final Prepaid Tax
Amount exceeds the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, then the amount of such
excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase Price. If
the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Final Prepaid Tax Amount is
less than the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be
reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such 

 



24  deficit. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Final Prepaid
Tax Amount is equal to the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, then there shall be
no Prepaid Tax Amount adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of the
Principal Closing.

(h) No payment pursuant to this Section 2.04 need be made by either party
until the date that is 15 business days after the determination of each final
Price Adjustment Statement (each, a " _Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date_ ");
_provided_ that, on or before each Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date, (i)
Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by Buyer) shall
pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be
designated by Seller), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one
or more bank accounts designated in writing by Seller at least two business
days prior to such Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date, cash in U.S. dollars
(or, with respect to any Purchase Price adjustment for any Country Unit for
which the portion of the Purchase Price allocated thereto pursuant to the
Allocation was paid in a Foreign Currency pursuant to Section 2.03(b), and to
the extent payment in a Foreign Currency is required by applicable Law, in
such Foreign Currency at the Exchange Rate as determined pursuant to Section
1.02(c)) in an amount equal to the positive Purchase Price adjustment under
Section 2.04(f) or Section 2.04(g), if any, or (ii) Seller (or one or more of
its Affiliates as may be designated by Seller) shall pay or cause to be paid
to Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by Buyer), in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Buyer at least two business days prior to such
Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date, cash in U.S. dollars (or, with respect to
any Purchase Price adjustment for any Country Unit for which the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated thereto pursuant to the Allocation was paid in a
Foreign Currency pursuant to Section 2.03(b), and to the extent payment in a
Foreign Currency is required by applicable Law, in such Foreign Currency at
the Exchange Rate as determined pursuant to Section 1.02(c)) in an amount
equal to the negative Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.04(f) or
Section 2.04(g).

SECTION 2.05.  _Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) Buyer and Seller shall
agree on an allocation of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities (and any
other amounts treated as paid in consideration for the Transferred Assets and
the Transferred Company for applicable Tax purposes) among Seller, the
Transferred Company and the Asset Selling Affiliates (the " _Allocation_ ").
The Allocation shall be consistent with this Section 2.05, applicable Tax Law,
including Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code and any Laws relating to Transfer
Taxes, and _Schedule 2.05(a)_.

(b) Within 15 business days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a schedule containing an estimate of the percentage of the
Purchase Price allocable to each of the ten countries that Seller estimates to
have the ten highest such percentages. Such schedule will be for
informational purposes only and will not be binding on either Buyer or Seller
for any purpose, including with respect to the Proposed Allocation described
in the immediately following sentence. Within 60 days after the date of
this Agreement, Seller shall deliver a draft of the Allocation (the "
_Proposed Allocation_ ") to Buyer. Except as provided in Section 2.05(c) and
Section 2.05(d), at the close of business on the 45th day after delivery of
the Proposed Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon
Buyer and Seller as the Allocation, including for purposes of determining the
"Purchase Price" with respect to each Country Transfer Agreement.

 



25 (c) Buyer shall raise any objection (so long as such objection is reasonable)
to the Proposed Allocation in writing within 45 days of the delivery of the
Proposed Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any dispute within 45 days after delivery of any objection to the Proposed
Allocation. If Buyer and Seller resolve in writing all such disputes
concerning the Proposed Allocation within 45 days after delivery of such
objection, the Proposed Allocation, as amended to reflect such resolution,
shall become binding upon Buyer and Seller as the Allocation, including for
purposes of determining the "Purchase Price" with respect to each Country
Transfer Agreement.

 

(d) If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the Allocation within 45 days after
delivery of any objection to the Proposed Allocation, then all remaining
disputed items shall be submitted for resolution by an independent appraisal
firm mutually selected by Buyer and Seller or, if the parties are unable to
agree, an independent appraisal firm selected by Sellers and Buyers
independent accounting firms (such firm, the " _Appraisal Firm_ "). Buyer and
Seller shall each request that the Appraisal Firm make a final determination
in writing as to the disputed items within 30 days after such submission. The
Proposed Allocation shall be amended in accordance with the written findings
of the Appraisal Firm, and the Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall
become binding upon Buyer and Seller as the Allocation, including for purposes
of determining the "Purchase Price" with respect to each Country Transfer
Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Appraisal Firm pursuant to this
Section 2.05 shall be borne one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

(e) The Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustments (including
those described in Section 2.04) to the Purchase Price under this Agreement,
and any other adjustments mutually agreed to between the parties. If, after
all adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with respect to the
Closing Inventory or the property, plants and equipment of Seller, the
Transferred Company or any Asset Selling Affiliate, when expressed in the
relevant local currency at the Exchange Rate used to determine the Closing
Inventory and the property, plants and equipment, is different from the local
currency net book value recorded on the statutory books for the Transferred
Assets of Seller or such Asset Selling Affiliate as of the Applicable Closing
Date, then the Allocation with respect to the Closing Inventory or
the property, plants and equipment (as applicable) of Seller or such Asset
Selling Affiliate shall be adjusted so that it is equal to such local currency
net book value, and the parties will mutually agree to a corresponding upward
or downward adjustment (as appropriate) elsewhere in the Allocation.

(f) Each of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall prepare and
timely file its Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) on
a basis consistent with the Allocation and shall take no position inconsistent
with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any
Taxing Authority or otherwise, except as required by applicable Law. In the
event that the Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto,
and both Seller and Buyer agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to defend such Allocation in any audit or similar proceeding, and the dispute
shall be governed by the procedures for Claims in Section 10.05.

 



26 (g) To the extent that the amounts paid to Seller or any Asset Selling
Affiliate on the Principal Closing Date are not equal to the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to Seller or such Asset Selling Affiliate in the
Allocation, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05(e) (with respect to Seller or
any Asset Selling Affiliate, the " _Allocated Purchase Price_ "), the parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take all necessary
actions to refund, repay and redistribute as promptly as reasonably

Affiliate shall be equal to Sellers or such Asset Selling Affiliates
Allocated Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05(e).

 

SECTION 2.06. _Transfer Taxes and Other Costs_. (a) All Transfer Taxes payable

borne and paid solely by Buyer when due in compliance with applicable Transfer
Tax laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller determines (in its sole
reasonable discretion) that it is required by applicable Law to pay any
Transfer Taxes, then Seller shall pay such Transfer Taxes, and Buyer shall,
subject to receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of Sellers payment
thereof, promptly reimburse Seller in U.S. dollars (or, at Sellers request,
reimburse an Asset Selling Affiliate in local currency), whether or not such
Transfer Taxes were correctly or legally imposed by the applicable
Governmental Entity.

 

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall timely file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all Transfer
Taxes that such party is responsible to file under applicable Laws, and, if
required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.
Furthermore, each party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate the amount of any Transfer Tax
with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including
by executing and filing any forms or certificates reasonably required to
claim an available reduced rate of, or exemption from, Transfer Taxes.

 

(c) Buyer shall provide Seller with a preliminary list of Buyers Affiliates

30 days after Seller receives such list and (x) 45 days after the date of this
Agreement, Seller will provide to Buyer a memorandum describing the estimated
expected Transfer Taxes with respect to the Principal Closing in sufficient
detail so as to reasonably inform Buyer of the basis on which such expected

Unit Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a memorandum describing the
estimated expected Transfer Taxes with respect to each Non-Principal Closing

Subject to Buyer providing Seller, at Sellers request, with a list of Buyers
Affiliates that Buyer has designated pursuant to Section 2.02(f) to purchase
the Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests at least 30 days prior
to the Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer at least 20 days
before the Applicable Closing Date an updated memorandum describing in the
aforementioned detail the expected Transfer Taxes with respect to the
Applicable Closing by Seller or any Asset Selling Affiliate as reasonably
determined by Seller. The determination of whether any exemption from (or
reduction in) Transfer Taxes is available with respect to the consummation of
the Transactions shall be made by Seller in its reasonable discretion after
having reasonably consulted with Buyer during the time periods provided above
in this Section 2.06(c) and taking into account any reasonable comments made
by Buyer as part of such consultation. In making such determination, Seller
shall take into account any duly completed exemption certificates delivered to
it from Buyer no later than 10 days prior to the Applicable Closing Date to
which the certificate relates.

(d) All costs and fees associated with transferring to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates the Transferred IP, the Transferred IT and marketing authorizations
for the Products conveyed to Buyer or its Affiliates at the Applicable Closing

thereof by Seller or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, promptly reimburse
Seller or such Affiliate.

Transferred Asset to a location designated by Buyer shall be borne and paid

shall be incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates, Buyer shall, subject to
receipt of satisfactory evidence of the payment thereof by Seller or any of
its Affiliates, as applicable, promptly reimburse Seller or such Affiliate.

 

SECTION 2.07. _Withholding Taxes_. Each party is permitted to deduct or
withhold amounts from all amounts payable hereunder as required under
applicable Law. However, within 20 days of the expected Principal Closing
Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule of expected withholding amounts
with written explanations for each. Furthermore, each party shall reasonably
cooperate to reduce the amount of withholding Taxes imposed on amounts
payable hereunder, including by executing and filing any forms or certificates
reasonably required to claim an available reduced rate of, or exemption from,
withholding Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
pursuant to this Section 2.07 and paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Closing, Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless

AGREES THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES GIVEN HEREIN BY SELLER ARE IN
LIEU OF, AND BUYER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO, ANY IMPLIED

 



30  WARRANTIES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE APPLICABLE BECAUSE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE
UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY OTHER STATUTE, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Subject to the foregoing and except as set forth in the Schedules to the
Disclosure Letter (each of which relates to the corresponding Section or sub-

organizational power and authority to own or lease and operate its respective

communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is required in connection with the Transactions and (c) any effect,
event, occurrence, circumstance or change that, to the knowledge of Seller,
would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty or covenant of
Seller contained in this Agreement that could reasonably be expected to
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b) not to be
satisfied, it being understood and agreed, however, that if Seller fails to

party, based on the advice of its counsel, determines that this Agreement, or
any of the other Transaction Documents, must be publicly filed with a
Governmental Entity (other than filings required to be filed with the SEC),
then such party, prior to making any such filing, shall provide

 



56  the other party and its counsel with a redacted version of this Agreement

limit or otherwise modify Buyers agreements and obligations under Section
6.05(d)). In addition to the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide such evidence
as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be
reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought
hereunder. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of the

necessary information and assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. As soon as reasonably practicable,
Buyer shall form or otherwise identify to Seller the Affiliate of Buyer in
each Principal Country Unit that will acquire all or part of the Transferred
Assets or the Transferred Equity Interests or assume all or part of the
Assumed Liabilities, in each case, related to such Principal Country Unit.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event
later than ten business days after the date hereof with respect to filings

as reasonably practicable with respect to all other Anti-Trust Filings
(unless, in each case, a later date is mutually agreed between the parties),
Seller and Buyer shall file the Anti-Trust Filings and any other filings
required under any applicable Laws. Seller and Buyer shall provide to any
Governmental Entity whose consent, authorization, order or approval is

is a possibility, from the applicable Governmental Entities. The parties also
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate by providing
information reasonably requested by the other party in order to fulfill the
foregoing obligations.

(c) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Buyer
and Seller and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any
filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions,

 



57  (ii) promptly inform each other of any communication (or other
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions, (iii) consult with the other
party, and consider in good faith the views of the other party, prior to
entering into any agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the

filings and written communications between them or their Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or its respective staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Transactions. Buyer and Seller shall, to the

advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any in-person
discussion or meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions and to
participate in the preparation for such discussion or meeting. Each party also
agrees to keep the other party fully informed about any anti-trust issues
raised by any Governmental Entity.

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.05, to the extent necessary to obtain the
waiver or consent from any Governmental Entity required to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 5.01(e) or 5.02(e), as applicable, to obtain
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or orders of Governmental
Entities or to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any
Principal Closing Legal Impediment or Non-Principal Closing Legal Impediment,
Buyer shall: (i) propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such
offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, and in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, the sale, divestiture or disposition (including by licensing any
intellectual property rights) of any assets of the Business and/or any other
assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or equity interests
held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in entities with assets or businesses);
(ii) terminate or modify any existing relationships and contractual rights
and obligations; (iii) otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
action which it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take or
commit to take such action, that limits its freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets of the Business and/or any
other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or equity
interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in entities with assets
or businesses); and (iv) take promptly, in the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the Transactions unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
Transactions, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of
a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) of this
subsection (d)) necessary to avoid the entry of or to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or order. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers
obligations under this Section 6.05(d) shall be absolute and shall not be
qualified or limited by what may be considered commercially reasonable.

(e) To assist Buyer in complying with its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.05, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with
Buyer and its Affiliates to effect any of the actions described in Section
6.05(d), including by entering into one or more agreements reasonably
requested by Buyer to be entered into by any of them prior to the Applicable
Closing with respect to any of the matters contemplated by clauses (i) and
(ii) of subsection (d) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such actions
shall relate exclusively to the Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity
Interests, (ii) the effectiveness of

 



58  such actions shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Applicable
Closing, (iii) all rights and obligations of Seller and its Affiliates
pursuant thereto shall be assumed by Buyer effective at the Applicable

indemnify for and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from all Damages
arising from or relating to any such actions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Damages arising from or relating to any of the actions Seller and
its Affiliates may take pursuant to the immediately following sentence), it
being the intent of the parties that Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer
and its Affiliates shall be treated as if any such transaction was effected
for the account of Buyer and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that
none of the provisions of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the immediately
preceding proviso shall be construed to affect Buyers rights with respect to
Seller hereunder or under the Ancillary Agreements, including its rights to
indemnification under Article X hereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if and promptly after being requested by Buyer, Sellers and its
Affiliates obligation to cooperate with Buyer pursuant to this Section
6.05(e) shall include (A) entering into confidentiality agreements containing
customary terms with any Persons who Buyer identifies to Seller as potential
purchasers in a potential transaction of a type described in clauses (i) and
(ii) of Section 6.05(d) (" _Potential Purchasers_ "), (B) providing to Buyer
and Potential Purchasers such business and financial information (to the

a Potential Purchasers financing sources authorizing the distribution of

Sellers auditors or other agents, as applicable, and (E) negotiating and
entering into transitional service and manufacturing agreements required to
obtain approval by the Federal Trade Commission with buyers of divested
products as to which Seller retains assets, as necessary to facilitate
effective transition of products to new owners ( _provided_ that such
transitional service and manufacturing agreements are of no greater scope and
on no less favorable terms to Seller and its Affiliates than the scope and
terms reflected in the applicable Ancillary Agreements).

 

SECTION 6.06. _Access_. Seller shall give Buyer and its accountants, legal
counsel and other representatives reasonable access, for the sole purpose of
allowing Buyer to successfully transition the Business, during normal business
hours and without undue interruption to Seller, any of its Affiliates or the

the properties, books and records to the extent relating to the Business and
will furnish, at Buyers expense, Buyer, its accountants, legal counsel and
other representatives during such period such information to the extent

other representatives to contact any third party doing business with Seller or
access the properties, books or records of any such third party or of Seller
or its Affiliates to the extent related to any business of Seller or its
Affiliates other than the Business, in each case without Sellers prior
written consent. Buyer will hold in confidence all information so obtained

Principal Closing, Seller, at Sellers sole cost and expense, shall take or
cause to be taken those actions that are necessary to transfer, assign or
convey (a) the assets that are owned or held by the Transferred Company other
than those that would constitute Transferred Assets or (b) the liabilities or
obligations of the Transferred Company other than those that would constitute
Assumed Liabilities, in each case, to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller such
that, as of the Principal Closing, (i) the assets owned or held by the
Transferred Company consist solely of assets that would otherwise constitute
Transferred Assets pursuant to clauses (i) through (xix) of _Annex 2.02(a)_
and (ii) the liabilities and obligations of the Transferred Company consist
solely of liabilities and obligations that would otherwise constitute Assumed
Liabilities pursuant to clauses (i) through (x) of _Annex 2.02(c)_. Seller

these transfers, assignments or conveyances and shall reasonably consult with

liabilities, other than with respect to assets of the type referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) of _Annex 2.02(b)_ and liabilities of the type referred

otherwise expressly provided herein, Seller and its Affiliates will have no
recourse against the Transferred Company with respect to any such transfer,

with respect to any potential Alternative Proposal. Seller and its
Affiliates shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, with
respect to third parties with whom discussions or negotiations with respect to
an Alternative Proposal have been terminated on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or
destruction of, in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement, confidential information previously furnished by Seller or any of
its Affiliates, or its or their Representatives, with respect to the
Business.

 



61 (b) Seller will promptly notify Buyer orally (and then in writing within
24 hours) after it or any of its Affiliates has received any proposal,
inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, any request for
discussions or negotiations, or any request for information relating to the
Business in connection with an Alternative Proposal or a potential Alternative
Proposal or for access to the properties or books and records thereof in

means any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any expression of interest by any
third party relating to Sellers or any of its Affiliates willingness or
ability to receive or discuss a proposal or offer, other than a proposal or
offer by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for any merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,

"144A-for-life" basis) for the purpose of financing the Transactions, the fees
and expenses incurred in connection therewith and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Debt Financing_ ") as may be reasonably requested

out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection
with such cooperation. Buyer and its Affiliates shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against
any Damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement

other party for the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of any

resolution of any Product Claims or other legal, administrative, arbitration,
suits, litigation, proceeding or investigation relating to the Business that
arises after the Applicable Closing but relates to the conduct of the
Business during the period prior to the Applicable Closing (collectively, "
_Post-Closing Claims_ "), Seller will forward, as promptly as practicable, any
and all correspondence, notices or other documents received by Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with such Post-Closing Claims (subject to, in
each case, any applicable attorney client privilege, work product

 



65  doctrine or other similar legal privilege, unless Buyer shall have entered

Seller, pursuant to which such privilege or work product doctrine would not
be waived with respect to third parties). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither party nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to cooperate with
the other party or any of such other partys Affiliates pursuant to this
Section 7.03(b) with respect to a particular matter in the event that such
other party or any of its Affiliates asserts a defense or claim with respect

delivered by Seller under this Agreement and (y) required to be filed by
Buyer under Item 9.01(a) of Form 8-K, (B) cooperate with Buyer to obtain a
consent from Sellers independent certified public accountants to the
inclusion of their audit report with respect to the 2015/2016/2017 Audited
Financial Statements and the 2018 Audited Financial Statements (as applicable)
pursuant to S-X 3-05, to the extent such financial statements are (x)
required to be delivered by Seller under this Agreement and (y) required to be
filed by Buyer in any other public filing with the SEC and (C) otherwise
cooperate with Buyer in connection with any reasonable requests from Buyer to
Sellers independent certified public accountants in connection with any
required use of the financial statements referred to in the foregoing clauses

necessary acknowledgments, releases and consent requests requested by Sellers
independent certified public accountants).

 

(d) For a period of 18 months after the Principal Closing Date and at Sellers
sole cost and expense, Buyer shall make the Transferred Employees available
to Seller to assist Seller, and shall otherwise cooperate with Seller, in the
preparation and submission of

 



66  any financial statements or other financial information of the Business
required to be prepared by Seller under this Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement and the satisfaction of Sellers obligations hereunder or
thereunder, as well as in the preparation and submission of any of Sellers
financial statements, in each case to the extent such Transferred Employees
have provided such information or such assistance prior to the Principal
Closing.

SECTION 7.04. _Insurance_. Except with respect to insurance proceeds that
constitute Transferred Assets under clause (xvi) of _Annex 2.02(a)_ , the
coverage under all insurance policies related to the Business and arranged or
maintained by Seller or its Affiliates is only for the benefit of Seller and
its Affiliates, and not for the benefit of Buyer or the Business. As of the
Applicable Closing Date and consistent with Section 2.02(a), Buyer agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business as it
deems appropriate and agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from
any of Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies which may provide
coverage for claims relating in any way to the Business.

 

SECTION 7.05. _Payments from Third Parties_. In the event that, on or after
the Applicable Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other
funds due to the other pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction
Documents, then the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such
funds to the proper party. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right
of offset regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received
from third parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a
dispute regarding any other issue under any of the Transaction Documents.

 

SECTION 7.06. _Assurances_. Subject to Section 2.02(g), for a period of up to
the later of (i) 18 months after the Principal Closing Date and (ii) six
months after any Applicable Closing Date, if either Buyer or Seller becomes
aware that any of the Transferred Assets with respect to which the Applicable
Closing has occurred has not been transferred to Buyer or that any of the
Excluded Assets has been transferred to Buyer, it shall promptly notify the
other and the parties hereto shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, ensure
that such property is transferred, with any necessary prior third-party
consent or approval, to:

(a) Buyer, in the case of any Transferred Asset with respect to which the
Applicable Closing has occurred and which was not transferred at the
Applicable Closing; or

(b) Seller, in the case of any Excluded Asset which was transferred at the
Applicable Closing.

SECTION 7.07. _Returned Goods_. For a period of one year after the Applicable
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to adhere to the returned goods policy set forth
on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.07_ with respect to all Products of the Business
received from customers, whether sold by Buyer or Seller, to the extent any
such returned Product has the name or trademark of Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller on it.

SECTION 7.08. _Tax Matters_. (a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns;
Payment of Taxes_. (i) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all Tax Returns of the Transferred Company for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods that are due (including applicable

 



67  extensions) on or before the Applicable Closing Date. Seller shall also
prepare and file all Tax Returns for the Transferred Company that are required
to be included in (or filed with) a Tax Return of an Affiliated Group. Any
such Tax Returns described in this Section 7.08(a)(i) (other than Tax Returns
for the Transferred Company that are required to be included in (or filed
with) a Tax Return of an Affiliated Group) shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Company (other than any
United States federal income Tax Return containing the Section 338(h)(10)
Election and any state income Tax Return giving effect to such Section
338(h)(10) Election) unless Seller notifies Buyer in writing that a different
position is required by applicable Law, and the parties mutually agree on the
resolution of such issue (and each party shall reasonably endeavor to reach
such mutual agreement).

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns (other than (A) those relating to Transfer Taxes,
which are addressed by Section 2.06, and (B) those that are required to be
included in or filed with a Tax Return of an Affiliated Group, which will be
filed by Seller) required to be filed by the Transferred Company, or in
respect of the Transferred Assets or the Business, and which are required to
be filed after the Applicable Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns as are filed
by the Transferred Company that include a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Transferred
Company, unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing that a different position is
required by applicable Law, and the parties mutually agree on the resolution
of such issue (and each party shall reasonably endeavor to reach such mutual
agreement). With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Buyer for
or including a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller for its
approval, at least thirty days prior to the due date for the filing of such
Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 7.08(d)(i) and a copy of such Tax Return, together with
any additional information that Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall
have the right to review such Tax Return, statement and additional
information, if any, prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and Buyer shall
reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted by Seller at
least five days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Any Tax Return of
the Transferred Company or an Asset Selling Affiliate for a Straddle Period
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on the basis that
the relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on the Applicable
Closing Date. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Company) shall file an amended Tax Return, or agree to any waiver
or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes, with respect to
the Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets, or the Business for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
Seller. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall file an amended Tax
Return, or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of limitations
relating to Taxes, with respect to the Transferred Company, the Transferred
Assets, or the Business for a Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Buyer; _provided_ , that no such consent shall be required where
such Tax Return, or such waiver or extension, relates to a Tax Return of an
Affiliated Group (or does not otherwise solely relate to the Transferred
Company, Transferred Assets or the Business).

 



68 (iii) Each of Seller and Buyer shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid,
all Taxes due and payable with respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by
it under Section 7.08(a), without limiting or altering any reimbursement
obligation by the other party pursuant to Section 7.08(d); _provided_ that,
with respect to any Tax Return described in Section 7.08(a)(ii) relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall pay any Taxes for which Seller has an
indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 7.08(d) to Buyer no later than
five days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return.

(b)  _Carrybacks_. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, hereby waives any right to use
or apply in any Pre-Closing Tax Period any Tax asset, including any net
capital loss, net operating loss, foreign Tax credit, charitable contribution
credit or research and development credit, of the Transferred Company arising
in any taxable period ending after the Applicable Closing Date.

 

(c) _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Company) with
respect to, any refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit received or
realized with respect to Taxes attributable to the Transferred Company, the
Transferred Assets or the Business for any taxable period ending on or before
the Applicable Closing Date, including any such amounts arising by reason of
amended Tax Returns filed after the Applicable Closing Date (but excluding any
amounts taken into account under the proviso in Section 7.08(d)(i)), net of
any unreimbursed costs (including Tax costs) Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Company) incurred in respect of any such refund,
credit, offset or other similar benefit received or realized, but only to the
extent that such refund (or credit) is not a refund (or credit) with respect
to the Final Prepaid Tax Amount. In connection with the foregoing, if Seller
determines that the Transferred Company is entitled to file or make a formal
or informal claim for a refund of Taxes (including by filing an amended Tax
Return) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall be entitled, at
Sellers expense, to file or make, or, at Sellers expense, to require that
Buyer cause the Transferred Company to file or make, such formal or informal
claim for refund, and Seller shall be entitled to control the prosecution of
such claim for refund. Buyer will cooperate, and cause the Transferred
Company to cooperate, with respect to such claim for refund, and will pay, or
cause the Transferred Company to pay, to Seller the amount (including
interest) of any related refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit
received or realized by Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (including the
Transferred Company), net of any unreimbursed costs (including any Tax costs)
incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in respect of such refund, credit, offset
or other similar benefit, within five days of receipt (or realization)
thereof. Buyer and the Transferred Company shall be entitled to retain, or
receive prompt payment from Seller with respect to, any refund, credit, offset
or other similar benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes
attributable to the Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Business for a taxable period beginning after the Applicable Closing Date.
Buyer and Seller shall equitably apportion any refund, credit, offset or other
similar benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to
the Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business for a Straddle
Period in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in Section
7.08(d)(v). If, as a result of the resolution of any Tax Proceeding, the
amount of any such refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit paid over
to Seller is reduced, Seller shall repay to the Buyer an amount equal to any
such reduction.

 



69 (d) _Tax Indemnification_. __

 

(i) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless
from and against all liability for (A) Taxes imposed on the Transferred
Company, or for which the Transferred Company may otherwise be liable, as a
result of having been a member of an Affiliated Group (including Taxes for
which the Transferred Company may be liable pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 or 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2) and any Taxes resulting from the
Transferred Company ceasing to be a member of any Affiliated Group), (B)
Taxes imposed on the Transferred Company, or for which the Transferred
Company may otherwise be liable, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including (x)
any Taxes attributable, relating, or with respect, to any transfer,
assignment and/or conveyance contemplated by Section 6.07 and (y) any Taxes as
a result of, or relating or attributable to, any obligation of the Transferred
Company under any Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or Tax sharing agreement
entered into prior to the Principal Closing, or as a result of the Transferred
Company being a transferee or successor in a transaction occurring prior to
the Principal Closing), (C) Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities, (D)
Taxes arising out of, attributable to, relating to, or resulting from, a
breach by Seller or its Affiliates of any of its covenants or agreements in
this Agreement, (E) any Taxes resulting from any action of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (including prior to the Principal Closing Date, the
Transferred Company) that causes the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be invalid
and (F) any Taxes described in Section 2.02(i); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Sellers indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to this Section 7.08(d)
shall be reduced by the amount of any refunds of Taxes with respect to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods to the extent received after the Applicable Closing Date
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Company) and not
remitted to Seller prior to the date on which Seller is required to make the
applicable indemnity payment hereunder.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 7.08(d)(i) above, Seller shall not indemnify,
defend or hold harmless Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Company) from any liability for Taxes to the extent directly
attributable to (A) any election made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates under
U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law effective for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (and the costs attributable to any such election shall be borne
solely by Buyer), which election is made after the Applicable Closing Date
and is not expressly required by this Agreement, (B) any action or failure to
act by Buyer or any of its Affiliates that causes the Section 338(h)(10)
Election to be invalid or (C) any other action taken or failure to act, in
each case after the Applicable Closing Date and outside of the ordinary course
of business, by Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Company), or any transferee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Company), but excluding any such action or failure to act
expressly required by this Agreement, effected with the written consent of
Seller or required by applicable Law (including the filing of any Tax Return
and any position reflected thereon) (such action or failure to act, together
with the preceding clauses (A) and (B), a " _Buyer Tax Act_ "), which Buyer
Tax Act would otherwise give rise to a Seller Tax indemnity obligation under
this Section 7.08(d) or reduce any Tax asset of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Section 338(h)(10)
Election nor any Code Section 338(g) election (or any comparable election
under state or local Tax Law) expressly permitted by Section 2.02(i) shall
constitute a Buyer Tax Act.

 



70 (iii) Notwithstanding Section 7.08(d)(i) above, Seller shall not
indemnify, defend or hold harmless Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Company) from any liability for (A) Transfer Taxes for which
Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section 2.06(a) or (B) Taxes attributable to
a breach by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Company) of
any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement.

(iv) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Company) shall
indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against
all (A) Tax liabilities of the Transferred Company, or with respect to the
Transferred Assets or the Business, other than any such Tax liabilities that
Seller must indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates for under Section 7.08(d)(i),
(B) liabilities for Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to
Section 2.06(a), (C) Tax liabilities attributable to a Buyer Tax Act, or (D)
Tax liabilities attributable to any breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Company) of any covenant or other agreement
hereunder;

 

(v) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 

(A) The periodic Taxes of the Transferred Company, Seller and the Asset
Selling Affiliates, that are not based on income or receipts ( _e.g._ ,
property Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed based upon
the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number
of days in the entire Tax period; and

(B) Taxes of the Transferred Company, Seller and the Asset Selling Affiliates
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than Taxes described in Section
7.08(d)(v)(A) above, shall be computed as if such Tax period ended as of the
close of business on the Applicable Closing Date and, in the case of any
Taxes of the Transferred Company, Seller and the Asset Selling Affiliates
attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or
other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable state, local or
foreign Law), as if the Tax period of such partnership, other "flowthrough"
entity or "controlled foreign corporation" ended as of the close of business
on the Applicable Closing Date.

(vi) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section
7.08(d) shall be made within 30 days after the indemnified party makes written
demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than five business
days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to
the applicable Taxing Authority.

(vii) The indemnification obligations under this Section 7.08(d)
shall survive the Applicable Closing until the date that is 60 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and shall thereafter
expire and be of no force or effect.

 

(e) _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(i) Buyer shall notify Seller within 15 business days after Buyer becomes
aware of a Tax Proceeding for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to the
Transferred

 



71  Company ( _provided_ that any failure by Buyer to do so shall not affect
Sellers indemnification obligations under Section 7.08(d)(i) except to the
extent that Seller is materially prejudiced by such failure). With respect to
any Tax Proceeding relating to (A) Taxes that are subject to indemnification
under Section 7.08(d)(i), (B) any Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities or (C) a
Tax Return for an Affiliated Group, Seller may choose in its sole discretion
(at its expense) to control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken
in connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel), and,
without limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund or contest the
Tax at issue in such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the progress and developments of any
material Tax Proceeding described in this Section 7.08(e)(i) (other than one
described in clause (C) above) that is relevant to the Transferred Company
and, with respect to any such material Tax Proceeding that Buyer reasonably
determines may have a material effect on Buyer in a Post-Closing Tax Period,
Seller shall communicate and consult with Buyer regarding any potential
settlement, which obligation shall not affect Sellers discretion under this
Section 7.08(e)(i).

 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided herein, including Section 2.05(f), Buyer
shall control all other Tax Proceedings not described in Section 7.08(e)(i)
with respect to Taxes of the Transferred Company or Taxes otherwise relating
solely to the Transferred Assets or the Business, in each case, for any Post-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(iii) Buyer, the Transferred Company and each of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall cooperate in contesting any Tax Proceeding, which cooperation shall
include the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting party
of records and information, including copies of any relevant Tax Returns and
supporting work schedules, which are reasonably relevant to such Tax
Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Proceeding.
Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section 7.08(e).

 

(f) _Miscellaneous_. __

 

(i) Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate (including
the Transferred Company) to, take any action on the Applicable Closing Date
other than in the ordinary course of business except as required by this
Agreement or applicable Law or with Sellers consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(ii) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 

(A) Buyer and Seller shall join in timely making a valid election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state or
local Tax Law) (the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_") with respect to
the Transferred Company.

 



72 (B) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, following
the Principal Closing, the Transferred Company) not to, undertake any action
or engage in any transaction that would jeopardize the validity of the Section
338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including, following the Principal Closing, the Transferred Company) not to,
undertake any action or engage in any transaction that would jeopardize the
validity of the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 

(C) Seller shall prepare and file all Section 338 Forms in accordance with
applicable Tax Law. At least 45 days prior to the date the Section 338 Forms
are required to be filed, Seller shall (x) deliver a draft of such Section 338
Forms to Buyer and (y) Seller shall make any changes to such forms as
reasonably requested by Buyer. Buyer shall execute and deliver to Seller such
Section 338 Forms (as amended) at least 20 days prior to the date such Section
338 Forms are required to be filed. Nothing in this Section 7.08(f)(ii) shall
affect the rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller under Section 2.05.

(D) Buyer and Seller agree to report the transfers under this Agreement
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law.

 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.08, with respect to the
Transferred Company, Buyer shall not make or change any election with respect
to Taxes that would give rise to a Seller Tax indemnity obligation under
Section 7.08(d)(i) or reduce any Tax asset of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(iv) Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the other with such information
and records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection
with any Tax compliance obligations, any reasonable Tax-related questions
relating to Business Records or Contracts, or the conduct of any Tax
Proceeding relating to the Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be permitted to make any such reasonable
requests prior to any Applicable Closing Date. Buyer shall, within 120 days
after the end of the applicable Tax period, prepare, or cause the Transferred
Company to prepare, in either case in a manner consistent with the
Transferred Companys past practices, all Tax work paper preparation packages
necessary to enable Seller to prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax
Returns that Seller is obligated to prepare, or cause to be prepared, with
respect to such Tax period under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be required to provide Buyer with a
copy of, or otherwise disclose the contents of, any Tax Return for an
Affiliated Group.

 



73 (v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any claims for any and
all Tax matters (including with respect to any Tax Proceedings described in
Section 7.08(e) but not with respect to Tax Proceedings described in Section
2.05(f), which shall be governed by Section 10.06) shall be made only pursuant
to, and the procedures with respect thereto shall be governed exclusively by,
this Section 7.08 and shall not be governed by the provisions of Article X;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sections 10.01, 10.07, 10.08 and 10.09
shall apply to such claims and such procedures with respect thereto and, for
the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any conflict between any provision of
this Section 7.08 and any provision of Article X, the provisions of this
Section 7.08 shall control; _provided, further_ , that any claim by Buyer
under Section 10.02 arising out of or as a result of any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18(d) or Section 3.18(l)
shall be subject to the procedures of Section 7.08(e) and this Section
7.08(f) and shall not be subject to Section 10.05 and Section 10.06 (it being
understood that, in the event of any conflict between any provision of this
Section 7.08 and any provision of Article X, the provisions of this Section
7.08 shall control). For purposes of Sections 10.07, 10.08 and 10.09, (A) a
party entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.08 shall be an
Indemnified Party and (B) a party with an indemnification obligation under
this Section 7.08 shall be an Indemnifying Party.

(vi) Any Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or Tax sharing agreement (other than
(A) agreements a primary purpose of which is not the allocation or
indemnification of Taxes, (B) agreements for the borrowing of money and (C)
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document) between the Transferred
Company, on the one hand and any Person, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as to the Transferred Company on or prior to the Principal Closing
Date, and after the Principal Closing Date, none of the Transferred Company,
Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall not have any liability thereunder.

(g) _Survival_. The obligations set forth in this Section 7.08 shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby until 60 days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations except for
such claims for indemnification asserted prior to such date, which claims
shall survive until final resolution thereof.

SECTION 7.09. _Ancillary Agreements_. At the Principal Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall enter into, execute and deliver the Transition Services
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit G_ (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ "), the Transition Manufacturing Services
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit H_ (the "
_Transition Manufacturing Services Agreement_ ") and the Reverse Transition
Services Agreement, substantially in the form of the Transition
Services Agreement (as applicable to Administrative Services (as defined
therein)), _mutatis mutandis_ , __ with respect to the provision of the
services described on _Schedule 7.09_ by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (the "
_Reverse Transition Services Agreement_ ").

SECTION 7.10. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the
Asset Selling Affiliates have not taken, and do not intend to take, any
action required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws
or similar Laws of any jurisdiction. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller
and the Asset Selling Affiliates with the provisions of any

 



74  bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or similar Laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that the foregoing
acknowledgement and waiver shall not be deemed to limit, waive, or otherwise
modify the representations and warranties of Seller as set forth in Article
III of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.11. _Replacement of Seller Guaranties_. On or prior to Principal
Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts (and Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in good faith) so as to cause the replacement,
effective as of the Principal Closing, of all guaranties, letters of credit
and other sureties provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the
Transferred Company to the Business (the " _Credit Support Items_ ") on a
like-for-like basis; _provided_ that if any Credit Support Item is not
replaced effective as of the Principal Closing, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to replace such Credit Support Item promptly
after the Principal Closing and shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates
against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages (including
all out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates to
maintain such Credit Support Item) incurred or suffered by Seller or any of
its Affiliates related to or arising out of such Credit Support Item.

 

SECTION 7.12. _Confidentiality; Other Transaction Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Principal Closing, each of Seller and Buyer shall not,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their respective
representatives not to, disclose to any Person other than their respective
authorized officers, directors and employees, any Confidential Information (as
defined below), except, in the case of Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective representatives, to the extent necessary to perform their
respective obligations pursuant to any of the Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller, Buyer, their respective
Affiliates or their respective officers, directors and employees shall have
any obligation to keep confidential any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law or made
in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy related to this
Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any of the Transactions;
_provided_ that in the event disclosure is required by applicable Law, the
disclosing party shall, to the extent legally permissible and feasible,
provide the other party with reasonable prior notice of such requirement prior
to making any disclosure so that such other party may, at such other partys
sole cost and expense, seek an appropriate protective order. For purposes
of this Section 7.12(a), " _Confidential Information_ " means, (A) in the
case of Sellers obligations hereunder, any information specifically related
to the Business, including methods of operation, customers, customer lists,
products, prices, fees, costs, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, software,
marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other
specialized information or proprietary matters, and (B) in the case of
Buyers obligations hereunder, any confidential or proprietary information
related to Seller or any of its Affiliates that is unrelated to the Business;
_provided_ , that Confidential Information does not include, and there shall
be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is generally
available to the public on the date of this Agreement, (ii) becomes generally
available to the public prior to or after disclosure hereunder other than as
a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder, (iii) is
independently developed or derived by the disclosing party or any of its
Affiliates without use of or reference to any Confidential Information
or (iv) becomes available to the disclosing party or its Affiliates or

 



75  representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the
other party or its Affiliates or representatives) which, to its knowledge,
after due inquiry, is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to the other party or its
Affiliates. Both parties understand that in accordance with the Defend Trade
Secrets Act of 2016, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under
any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (i) is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government
official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, solely for the
purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) is
made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding,
if such filing is made under seal. Both parties shall be responsible for any
actions of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers and employees in
violation of the confidentiality restrictions in this Section 7.12(a). 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply with the
obligations set forth on _Schedule 7.12._

 

ARTICLE VIII

_Employees _

SECTION 8.01. _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller
advance copies of, and consult with Seller and obtain Sellers consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
distributing any communications to any Employee of the Business whether
relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise
relating to the Business; _provided_ that (i) Sellers consent shall not be
required (but the remainder of this Section 8.01(a) shall apply) with respect
to the form or content of offer letters or other individual communications
regarding post-Closing employment of Employees of the Business (including
proposed terms of employment, compensation and employee benefits or role
or organizational structure) and (ii) this Section 8.01(a) shall not apply to
individual conversations or communications regarding matters not covered by
the Transaction Documents. Seller shall provide the Buyer with advance copies
of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on, all communications with
Employees of the Business relating to post-Closing employment with Buyer and
its Affiliates. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Applicable
Closing Date, Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate (i) to establish, no later
than 30 business days following the date of this Agreement, a communications
plan for purposes of communicating details regarding the Transactions and the
actions contemplated by this Article VIII to Employees of the Business,
including the anticipated delivery of the employment offers contemplated by
Section 8.01(c) (the " _Communications Plan_ ") and (ii) to periodically
update the Communications Plan prior to the Applicable Closing Date;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any communications to any
Employee of the Business pursuant to the Communications Plan shall remain
subject to the first two sentences of this Section 8.01(a).

 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list on
Schedule 8.01(b) containing an identification number, date of hire (or
recognized service date), position,

 



76  location, and base salary, wage rate, target bonus (and, for sales
employees, sales incentive targets), the bonuses or sale incentives paid for
the prior fiscal year, outstanding equity awards (including grant date,
vesting schedule and exercise price, as applicable, and the information
required by Section 8.01(k)), expatriate status and any additional information
that is necessary for Buyer to establish payroll systems or employee benefit
plans as of the Transfer Time, as applicable, of each individual identified by
Seller as expected to be an Employee of the Business, and Seller shall update
such information periodically prior to the Applicable Closing Date to reflect
new hires, leaves of absence and employment terminations and any other
material changes thereto and provide copies of such updated lists and
information to Buyer.

 

(c) In the event the employment of an Employee of the Business does not
automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the
Applicable Closing by operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer of the
Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer or its Affiliates, (i) Seller shall
take, or cause its respective Affiliates to take, all actions required
in accordance with applicable Law in respect of the transfer of employment of
such Employees of the Business to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and Seller
shall encourage each Employee of the Business to accept any offers of
employment pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) in its communications with such
individuals; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall
be interpreted as requiring Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide any
such Employee of the Business with any additional compensation or benefits or
otherwise incur any material liability; and (ii) not less than 10 business
days prior to the Applicable Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates will
offer employment, effective at 12:01 A.M., local time, on the day of the
Applicable Closing Date (the " _Transfer Time_ "), to such Employee of the
Business in accordance with this Agreement. Offers pursuant to this Section
8.01(c) shall (A) be for a position substantially comparable to the position
held by such Employee of the Business immediately prior to the Transfer Time
and either requiring a commute of not more than 50 miles from his or her
office location as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date or
allowing such Employee of the Business to work out of his or her home (a "
_Home Relocation_ "), provided that such Home Relocation does not result in
Seller incurring any additional severance obligations, (B) provide for (i)
the payment of base wages and bonus opportunities that are not less than as
provided to such Employees of the Business immediately prior to the Applicable
Closing Date, (ii) employee benefits (including defined benefit pension
benefits and equity compensation benefits, but excluding retiree medical
benefits) that in the aggregate have a value that is no less favorable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer may satisfy by providing cash payments or other
benefits in lieu of equity compensation or other benefits) and (C) otherwise
comply in all respects with applicable Law (including with respect to
compensation and benefits). With respect to any Employee of the Business to
whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates is required to make an offer of employment
pursuant to this Section 8.01(c), and who, as of the Applicable Closing Date,
is on approved leave of absence from work with Seller or its Affiliates (each,
an " _Inactive Employee_ "), Buyer shall offer employment to such individual
on the earliest practicable date following the return of such individual to
work with Seller and its Affiliates and otherwise on terms and conditions
consistent with this Article VIII; _provided_ that such employee returns to
work within 180 days following the Applicable Closing Date or such later time
as required by applicable

 



77  Law or the terms of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement upon
presenting themselves for duty to the Business. Seller shall promptly notify
Buyer of the occurrence and end of any such leave of absence. In the case of
any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee on or after the day
following the Applicable Closing Date, all references in this Agreement to (A)
the Applicable Closing Date (other than in the first sentence of Section
8.01(i) and Section 8.01(m)) shall be deemed to be references to the day prior
to the date on which such individual becomes a Transferred Employee and (B)
the Transfer Time shall be deemed to be references to 12:01 A.M., local time,
on the date that such individual becomes a Transferred Employee. In any
jurisdiction where the employment of an Employee of the Business can transfer
automatically to Buyer and its Affiliates upon the occurrence of
the Applicable Closing by operation of Law, (x) Buyer and Seller agree to
take, or cause their respective Affiliates to take, all actions required under
applicable Law and all other actions as are necessary or appropriate such that
the employment of such Employee of the Business will transfer to Buyer or its
Affiliates automatically as of the Transfer Time and (y) in respect of
Employees of the Business who are principally employed in Mexico, such
Employees of the Business will be transferred to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates as of the Applicable Closing Date through "employer substitution
mechanics".

 

(d) (i) Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations
and costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the Business
for any statutory or common law severance or other separation benefits, any
contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any other legally
mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable during a
mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a Judgment of
a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto) and for any other claim,
cost, liability or obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or
otherwise), in each case, directly or indirectly arising out of (A) Buyers
breach of its obligations under this Article VIII or (B) any claims for
severance or other separation benefits in connection with an involuntary
termination of employment by Buyer or its Affiliates of any Transferred
Employee after the Transfer Time (including any such termination that occurs
or is deemed to have occurred by reason of a Home Relocation).

(ii) Buyer and its Affiliates on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates
on the other hand, shall each bear 50% of the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to any claims made by any Employee of the Business for any
statutory or common law severance or other separation benefits and any other
legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable
during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a
Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto) and for any
claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether related to compensation,
benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of (A) the transfer of the
Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer or its Affiliates, (B) a voluntary or
involuntary termination of employment at the Transfer Time, (C) the Employee
of the Business objection to the automatic transfer of employment to Buyer
and its Affiliates or (D) any claims made by any Employee of the Business in
the Peoples Republic of China for any statutory severance or
other separation benefits that arise as a result of any such employee who
accepts an offer of employment from Buyer or any of its

 



78  Affiliates making a request that such severance or other separation benefits
be paid or provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates, but in each case
excluding any claims, costs, liabilities or obligations, in each case,
covered by clause (i) of this Section 8.01(d). With respect to each claim
covered by the immediately preceding sentence, each of the parties and their
respective Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party and
its Affiliates from and against such claim to the extent necessary so that
neither party and its Affiliates bears in excess of 50% of the liabilities,
obligations and costs relating to such claim. Neither Buyer nor Seller
shall encourage any Employee of the Business regarding a request described in
clause (D) of this Section 8.01(d)(ii).

 

(iii) Seller and its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations
and costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the Business
for any statutory or common law severance or other separation benefits, any
contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any other legally
mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable during a
mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a Judgment of
a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto) and for any other claim,
cost, liability or obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or
otherwise), in each case, not covered by clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section
8.01(d), including any such claim arising out of the applicable Employee of
the Business refusal to accept an offer of employment made in compliance
with this Article VIII from Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

(e) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, for the 18-month period
immediately following the Applicable Closing Date (the " _Compensation
Protection Period_ ") Buyer or its Affiliates: (i) shall provide to each
Transferred Employee a base salary, wage rate and bonus opportunities, as
applicable, that are not less than as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(b)_
and employee benefits (including defined benefit pension benefits and equity
compensation benefits, but excluding retiree medical benefits) under plans,
programs and arrangements that will provide benefits to such Transferred
Employee that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits
provided by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Applicable
Closing Date; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may satisfy
its obligations pursuant to this clause (i) by providing cash payments or
other benefits in lieu of equity compensation or other benefits, and (ii)
shall either provide an office within a commute of no more than 50 miles from
his or her office as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date or
provide for a Home Relocation; _provided_ that if a relocation beyond that
distance or a Home Relocation is required and such employees employment
terminates as a result of his or her desire not to accept such a relocation,
such employee shall receive the severance benefits at the level set forth in
Section 8.01(f). Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, the value of any Make-Whole Compensation provided to the
Transferred Employees shall not be considered in determining whether Buyer and
its Affiliates have satisfied their obligations pursuant to this Section
8.01(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this
Agreement shall be construed as requiring either Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee or,
other than Sections 8.01(k) or 8.01(l), maintaining any compensation or
employee benefit plan, policy or program for any period after the Applicable
Closing Date; _provided_ that such employee shall receive the severance
benefits at the level set forth in Section 8.01(f).

 



79 (f) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the
Compensation Protection Period, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide
severance benefits to each Transferred Employee that are no less favorable
than the better of (i) those severance or termination benefits applicable to
such Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing
Date and (ii) those provided under Buyers severance plan, program, policy or
practice (whether contractual or otherwise) on the date of such Transferred
Employees termination;  _provided_ that such severance benefits shall be
provided only if the Transferred Employee executes (and does not revoke) a
release of claims in favor of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. 

(g) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under all
plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (" _Buyer Plans_ "),
service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Transfer Time to the
extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Listed Plan
covering such Transferred Employees, including for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit levels and accruals, but excluding accruals under a
defined benefit pension plan, and in each case, except (x) where it would
result in a duplication of benefits, including, subject to applicable Law,
with regard to severance that is required to be paid out to employees upon
transfer or (y) with respect to newly established Buyer Plans that do not
provide credit for past service to similarly situated employees of Buyer and
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Employees or newly hired
employees) and in which at least a comparable number of such similarly
situated of employees of Buyer and its Affiliates participate, (ii) waive
any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting
period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans established
or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Listed Plan, and (iii) provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Transfer Time
for the plan year in which the Applicable Closing occurs.

(h) If permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall pay to the
Transferred Employees (i) all accrued but unpaid vacation for periods prior
to the Transfer Time, and (ii) all base salary, wages, commissions or other
amounts (but not including any annual bonuses or incentives) in respect of
services performed by each Employee of the Business for Seller or its
Affiliates that are earned and accrued but unpaid as of the Transfer Time, as
applicable, in each case, to be paid as soon as administratively practicable
after the Transfer Time or as required by applicable Law, but in no event
later than 30 business days after the Transfer Time. If, under applicable Law,
Seller cannot pay the amounts described in the preceding sentence to
Transferred Employees, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any such amounts that
Buyer pays or credits to such Transferred Employees. Buyer will cooperate in
good faith with Transferred Employees with respect to vacation commitments
purchased or reserved by such Transferred Employees prior to the applicable
Transfer Time in respect of periods occurring subsequent to such applicable
Transfer Time; it being understood that any such vacation commitments
ultimately honored by Buyer shall count against the applicable Transferred
Employees paid time off credited by Buyer or accrued during his or her
service with Buyer or shall be unpaid.

 



80 (i) Subject to Seller providing all reasonably necessary support and
information in a timely manner (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
information reasonably necessary for Buyer to assume the Assumed Benefit
Plans, including, where they exist, plan documents reasonably requested by
Buyer which Seller agrees to make reasonable best efforts to provide within
15 Business Days after receipt of such a request), no later than the
Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or cause to be established (or
utilize existing Buyer Plans), at its own expense, all necessary retirement,
pension, employee welfare and employee benefit plans for Transferred
Employees, as applicable. Effective as of the Transfer Time, each Transferred
Employee shall cease to be an employee of Seller and its Affiliates and
shall cease to participate in any Business Employee Benefit Plan (other than
any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee. Seller shall be, or shall
cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (i) medical, vision, dental
and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred
Employee or his or her dependents, (ii) claims for short-term and long-term
disability income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, (iii) claims
for group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment
insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (iv) claims
relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to
any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents, in each
case, prior to the Transfer Time. Buyer shall be, or shall cause its
Affiliates to be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or
his or her dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability
income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, (C) claims for group
life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment
insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (D) claims
relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to
any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents, in each
case, on or after the Transfer Time. Except in the event of any claim for
workers compensation benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following
claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical,
vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital
expenses), upon provision of the services, materials or supplies comprising
any such benefits and (2) short-term and long-term disability, life,
accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance
benefits, upon the death, illness, injury or accident giving rise to such
benefits. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for
workers compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the Transfer Time by
any Transferred Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the
Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. A claim for workers compensation
benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the
claim (the " _Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs. If the Workers
Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following the
Transfer Time, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and liability of
Seller and Buyer and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Buyer
based upon the relative periods of time that the Workers Compensation Event
transpired preceding and following the Transfer Time.

 



81 (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.01 to the contrary,
with respect to each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, during the Compensation
Protection Period, or such longer period required by applicable Law, Buyer or
its Affiliates shall provide to such employee (i) terms and conditions of
employment (including seniority and other service credit) that individually,
are no less than as required by applicable Law, and in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than those provided by Seller and its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Transfer Time and (ii) amounts (and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, types, including defined benefit pension benefits, where
applicable) of compensation and benefits (including severance and
equity compensation benefits) that, individually, are no less than as
required by applicable Law and, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than
those provided by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may satisfy its obligations pursuant
to the preceding sentence by providing cash payments or other benefits in lieu
of equity compensation benefits (unless otherwise required by applicable Law).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the value of any
Make-Whole Compensation provided to the Transferred Employees shall not be
considered in determining whether Buyer and its Affiliates have satisfied
their obligations pursuant to this Section 8.01(j). Without limiting the
generality of this Section 8.01 or Buyers obligations hereunder, with respect
to Transferred Employees covered by any Collective Bargaining Agreement,
effective from and after the Transfer Time, Buyer and its Affiliates shall
comply with applicable Law concerning such Collective Bargaining Agreement in
the context of this Agreement.

 

(k) If a Transferred Employee holds any Unvested LTI Awards as of immediately
prior to the Transfer Time, then, for each such Unvested LTI Award, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide such Transferred
Employee with Make-Whole Compensation as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than 90 days, following the Transfer Time. With respect to any Unvested
LTI Award, " _Make-Whole Compensation_ " means one or more types of
compensation, which may be either cash based or equity based, vested or
unvested, that (i) provides the Transferred Employee with an aggregate
economic value that is at least equal to the value of the applicable Unvested
LTI Award and (ii) vesting and payment terms and schedules that, in each case,
are no less favorable than those of the applicable Unvested LTI Award;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such Make-Whole Compensation may vest on a
schedule that corresponds to the vesting schedule of awards granted by Buyer
in the ordinary course of business, so long as any extension to the vesting
period is less than 12 months. For purposes of clause (i) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the value of any Unvested LTI Awards that are (A) in the
form of restricted stock or restricted stock units shall be determined based
on the trading price of Parent common stock as of the close of trading on the
business day immediately prior to the Transfer Time and (B) in the form of
stock options shall be determined based on the intrinsic value (i.e., spread
value) of the stock options based on the difference between the applicable
exercise price and the trading price of Parent common stock as of the close of
trading on the business day immediately prior to the Transfer Time. Seller
shall include on _Schedule 8.01(b)_ all long term incentive awards held by
Employees of the Business that Seller expects to be Unvested LTI Awards listed
on _Schedule 8.01(b)_ , including, with respect to each such long term
incentive award, (x) the vesting schedule and (y) the applicable holders
Retirement Eligibility Date, and Seller shall update the applicable portion of
_Schedule 8.01(b)_ prior to the Transfer Time to reflect the grant, vesting
and forfeiture of long term incentive awards.

 



82 (l) For each Transferred Employee who participated in an annual
incentive compensation plan of Seller or one of its Affiliates (each, a "
_Seller Bonus Plan_ ") as of immediately prior to the Transfer Time, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, pay such Transferred Employee
an amount that is within his or her bonus opportunity range, as set forth on
_Schedule 8.01(b)_ , at the time prescribed by the applicable Seller Bonus
Plan and subject to such Transferred Employees continued employment with
Buyer and its Affiliates through the time prescribed by the applicable Seller
Bonus Plan (each such amount, a " _Transferred Employee Bonus Amount_ ");
_provided_ that, the aggregate amount of the Transferred Employee Bonus
Amounts paid in respect of any calendar year shall be equal to the aggregate
of the target bonuses (such aggregation, the " _Target Bonus Pool_ "), as set
forth on _Schedule 8.01(b)_ , for all Transferred Employees who receive a
Transferred Employee Bonus Amount in respect of such calendar year. As soon
as practicable following the date on which all Transferred Employee Bonus
Amounts have been paid in any country, Buyer shall provide Seller with a
schedule (the " _Paid Bonus Schedule_ ") that sets forth the name of each
Transferred Employee in such country who received a Transferred Employee Bonus
Amount and the amount so paid to such Transferred Employee, and not later than
30 business days following the receipt of such Paid Bonus Schedule, Seller,
or one of its Affiliates, shall reimburse Buyer for a portion of each
Transferred Employee Bonus Amount set forth on such Paid Bonus Schedule equal
to (i) such Transferred Employee Bonus Amount multiplied by (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the applicable
performance period of the applicable Seller Bonus Plan that elapsed prior to
the Transfer Time, and the denominator of which is 365.

 

(m) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Applicable Closing
Date (and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to transfer any such permit, pass or other
approval to Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to cooperate
with Buyer or its applicable Affiliate with respect to any ongoing approval
processes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, in the
event an applicable work permit for an Employee of the Business is not in
place with Buyer or its applicable Affiliate as of the Applicable Closing
Date, such Employee of the Business shall be treated as an Inactive Employee
hereunder; _provided_ , however, that Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, continue to use its and their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the applicable work permit; _provided_ , further, that
Seller shall not be obligated to provide for the services of such Employee of
the Business to be made available to Buyer or to provide any substitute for
such services.

(n) As of the Transfer Time, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its Affiliates
copies of all employment records for each Transferred Employee required to be
provided to Buyer and its Affiliates under applicable Law or as necessary for
Buyer to establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as of the
Transfer Time. Seller shall be permitted to retain copies of such employment
records, except where prohibited by applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates
shall ensure that all such records are used only in connection with the
employment of such Transferred Employee and shall keep such employment
records confidential.

 



83 (o) To the extent applicable, the parties hereto acknowledge the application
of the European Council Directive of March 12, 2001 (2001/23/EC) (the "
_Directive_ "), relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event
of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses and
any country legislation implementing the Directive and any other similar Law
(collectively, the " _Transfer Regulations_ "). Buyer shall take all such
actions that may be necessary or required in order to cause the Transfer
Regulations to apply to the Transactions, and Buyer shall refrain from taking
any action that could cause the Transfer Regulations not to apply to the
Transactions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that they shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with the Transfer
Regulations to the extent applicable.

(p) In the United States, pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Buyer
and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall apply the "standard" method
for purposes of employee payroll reporting with respect to any Employee of
the Business.

(q) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any Employee of
the Business are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including any
Employee of the Business (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any Employee of the Business.

(r) (i) To the extent permitted by applicable Law or any applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties shall provide that the services
of each Transferred Employee who is principally employed in Japan as of the
Applicable Closing Date and whose services Seller reasonably deems to be
necessary in order to fulfill Sellers obligations under the Transition
Manufacturing Services Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement (each
such employee, a " _Seconded Japan Employee_ ") shall be made exclusively
available, as of immediately following the Applicable Closing Date, to Seller
through an employee secondment arrangement; _provided_ that the number of such
Seconded Japan Employees shall not exceed 10 without Buyers written consent.
The services of the Seconded Japan Employees shall continue pursuant to the
terms of such secondment agreement until Seller reasonably determines that
they are no longer necessary in order to fulfill Sellers obligations under
the Transition Manufacturing Services Agreement and the Transition Services
Agreement, which period shall not, without Buyers written consent, exceed 36
months, in the case of the Transition Manufacturing Services Agreement, or 18
months, in the case of the Transition Services Agreement (each period
beginning on the Applicable Closing Date and ending on the date that such
services are no longer necessary, a " _Secondment Period_ ").

 

(ii) During the applicable Secondment Period, Buyer and its Affiliates agree
not to terminate the employment of the applicable Seconded Japan Employee,
other than for "cause" (as reasonably determined following consultation with
Seller). If the employment of any Seconded Japan Employee terminates for any
reason during the applicable Secondment Period, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall replace such Seconded

 



84  Japan Employee with an employee who it is determined, following consultation
with Seller, has the requisite skills, experience and, if applicable, licenses
to perform the necessary services following the termination of such Seconded
Japan Employee, and the employee who replaces such terminated employee shall
be made exclusively available to Seller and such employee shall become a
Seconded Japan Employee and the other provisions of this Section 8.01(r)
shall apply to such arrangement, _mutatis mutandis_.

(iii) During the applicable Secondment Period, Seller and its Affiliates
shall be responsible for all the economic costs of the applicable Seconded
Japan Employees compensation and benefits (including reimbursement for any
expenses incurred by such Seconded Japan Employee, all applicable fees, Taxes
and other amounts owed to third parties and all applicable social or national
insurance contributions), which economic costs may be considered in the
determination of any fees payable to Seller and its Affiliates pursuant
to the Transition Manufacturing Services Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement. Immediately following the applicable Secondment Period, the
applicable Seconded Japan Employee shall be available to perform services for
Buyer or its Affiliates, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all the economic costs of such Seconded Japan Employees compensation and
benefits (including reimbursement for any expenses incurred by such Seconded
Japan Employee, all applicable fees, Taxes and other amounts owed to third
parties and all applicable social or national insurance contributions);
_provided_ that if Buyer and its Affiliates do not continue the employment of
any of the Seconded Japan Employees immediately following the applicable
Secondment Period, Seller and its Affiliates may employ such Seconded Japan
Employee and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do so in a manner
that avoids or minimizes any severance expenses incurred in connection with
the Seconded Japan Employees termination of employment with Buyer and its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall be
responsible for any statutory severance or other separation benefits, any
contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any other legally
mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable during a
mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a Judgment of
a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto) and for any other claim,
cost, liability or obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or
otherwise), in each case, directly or indirectly arising out of the
termination of any Seconded Japan Employees employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates; _provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for any of the foregoing obligations that arise out of a
termination of any Seconded Japan Employees employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates for good cause as a result of Sellers breach of its
applicable work regulations or employment laws applicable to such Seconded
Japan Employee.

(a) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if (i) Seller shall have
failed to comply, in any material respect, with any of Sellers covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (ii) any one or more of the
representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement shall
prove to have been inaccurate in any material respect when made and, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), such failure or inaccuracy (A) would give rise,
if occurring or continuing on the Principal Closing Date, to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 5.01(a) or Section 5.01(b), as applicable, and
(B) has not been cured or is incapable of being cured by Seller or its

_provided_ that such 20th business day shall be extended (up to the Outside
Date) so long as Seller is using its commercially reasonable efforts to cure
any such breach;

(b) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if a Principal Closing Legal
Impediment exists that is final and non-appealable; or

(c) if the Principal Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside
Date;

_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may only terminate this Agreement pursuant
to the preceding clauses (a), (b) or (c) if at the time of termination Buyer
is not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.02.

SECTION 9.02. _Seller Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated by
Seller:

 

(a) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if (i) Buyer shall have failed

condition set forth in Section 5.02(a) or Section 5.02(b), as applicable, and
(B) has not been or is incapable of being cured by Buyer or its Affiliates

warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.01.

SECTION 9.03. _Notice of Termination_. Any party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Article IX shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party.

SECTION 9.04. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated

effect, with no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement (or any
of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents), except that the provisions of this Section 9.04 and Article XI will
survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for Damages incurred or
suffered by any other party as a result of any fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X

_Indemnification _

SECTION 10.01. _Survival_. All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement and the covenants contained in Article VI of this Agreement
shall survive the Principal Closing until the date that is 18 months from the
Principal Closing Date, and shall then expire and be of no force or effect;
_provided_ , _however_ that (a) the Seller Fundamental Representations and
the Buyer Fundamental Representations (together with the Seller Fundamental
Representations, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive
indefinitely and (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.10 (Intellectual Property Rights) shall survive until the date that is two
years from the Principal Closing Date. Any representation or warranty that is
the subject of any Claim with respect to which notice is delivered by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in this Section 10.01 shall survive with
respect to such Claim until such Claim is fully and finally resolved. The
other covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive
indefinitely.

SECTION 10.02. _Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_
") against and from any and all Damages which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur
or suffer to the extent such Damages arise out of or result from (i) the
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement as
if made on the Principal Closing Date, (ii) the breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation of Seller or its Affiliates set forth in this
Agreement or (iii) any of the Excluded Liabilities.

 



87  Notwithstanding that a claim for Damages may fall into multiple categories
of this Section 10.02, a Buyer Indemnitee may recover such Damages one time
only. Buyer shall take, and shall cause the other Buyer Indemnitees to take,
all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware
of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.
This Section 10.02 shall not apply to Damages arising out of or as a result
of Taxes other than Damages arising out of or as a result of any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18(d) or Section
3.18(l).

 

SECTION 10.03. _Indemnification by Buyer_. In addition to the indemnification
set forth in Sections 6.05(e), 6.11, 7.01(b), 7.01(c), 7.08(d)(iv) and
8.01(d), Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates,
and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and
from any and all Damages which any Seller Indemnitee may incur or suffer to
the extent such Damages arise out of or result from (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement as if made on the
Principal Closing Date, (ii) the breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation of Buyer or its Affiliates set forth in this Agreement or (iii) any
of the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding that a claim for Damages may fall
into multiple categories of this Section 10.03, a Seller Indemnitee may
recover such Damages one time only. Seller shall take, and shall cause the
other Seller Indemnitees to take, all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably
be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. This Section 10.03 shall not apply
to Damages arising out of or as a result of Taxes.

 

SECTION 10.04. _Limitations on Liability_. (a) Except with respect to claims
related to breaches of Fundamental Representations or any representation or
warranty contained in either Section 3.18(d) or Section 3.18(l),
indemnification shall be available to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees under clause (i) of Section 10.02 or clause (i) of Section 10.03
(as applicable) with respect to breaches of representations or warranties only
to the extent the aggregate amount of Damages otherwise due to the Buyer
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, for all claims for
such indemnification exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price and then such
indemnification shall be available to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, respectively, for the amount of all such payments due to the
Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, in excess of such
amount, but only for all such Damages up to 1% of the Purchase Price. Except
with respect to claims related to breaches of Fundamental Representations,
Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) of Section 10.02 with
respect to breaches of representations or warranties for any individual item
or series of related items arising out of the same or similar facts, events or
circumstances where the Damages relating thereto are less than $200,000. For
the avoidance of doubt, limitations of the scope of Sellers or Buyers
liability under this Section 10.04(a) do not apply to indemnification
obligations available to Buyer Indemnitees under clauses (ii) and (iii) of
Section 10.02 or to Seller Indemnitees under clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section
10.03.

 

(b) The amount of Damages resulting from any inaccuracy or breach of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
determined without references to the terms "material", "materially", "Material
Adverse Effect", "material adverse effect" or other similar qualifications as
to materiality (including specific monetary thresholds) (other than any
instances in which such qualifications or monetary thresholds

 



88  qualify any list (rather than disclosing exceptions to the relevant
representations) of Contracts, Product Registrations or Business Employee
Benefit Plans to be set forth on the Disclosure Letter) contained or
incorporated in any such representation or warranty, but such qualifications
and monetary thresholds, to the extent contained or incorporated in any such
representation or warranty, shall apply for the purposes of
determining whether any such inaccuracy or breach has occurred.

(c) The right of the Indemnitees to seek indemnification pursuant to this
Article X shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that,
based on any facts or circumstances known, or that should have been known, to
Seller, Buyer or any other Indemnitee, including from any investigation made
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, the information provided in the
Management Presentation, the Data Room or given in writing to such Indemnitee
prior to the date of this Agreement (except, for the avoidance of doubt, any
disclosure of any fact or item in any portion to the Disclosure Letter), such
Indemnitee or any of its representatives knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

 

SECTION 10.05. _Claims_. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article X (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, action, cause of action, claim,
demand, fact or other circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a
" _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect
to each Claim, such facts and information as are then reasonably available,
including the estimated amount of Damages and the specific basis for
indemnification hereunder, to the extent known. Failure to give prompt notice
of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure.

SECTION 10.06. _Defense of Actions_. The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys option and expense, within 30
days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of any Claim, to assume the
complete defense of any Claim based on any action, suit, proceeding, claim,
demand or assessment by any third party with full authority to conduct such
defense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, and to settle or otherwise dispose of the
same and the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in such defense;
_provided_ the Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such action,
suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to the entry of any
Judgment or enter into any settlement (a) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages for which Indemnifying Party has
confirmed in writing to the Indemnified Party that it is obligated to
indemnify Indemnified Party hereunder for the full amount of such damages, (b)
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
third-party claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability
in respect thereof and/or (c) which includes any admission of wrongdoing or
misconduct by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, in
accordance with this Section 10.06, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be liable
to the Indemnified Party only for such legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof at
the request of the Indemnifying Party

 



89  and (ii) the Indemnifying Party will afford the Indemnified Party an
opportunity to participate in such defense through counsel chosen by the
Indemnified Party ( _provided_ that the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be paid by such Indemnified Party). As to those third-party actions,
suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense, the
Indemnified Party will afford the Indemnifying Party an opportunity to
participate in such defense, at its cost and expense, and will consult with
the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or otherwise disposing of any of the
same. The Indemnified Party will not settle any Claim without the prior
consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
10.06 to the contrary, (x) the Indemnifying Party shall not be permitted to
assume the defense of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or
assessment if (1) the Claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal Action; (2) the claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party (other than an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that is incidental to monetary
damages as the primary relief sought); or (3) the amount of Damages suffered
or expected to be suffered with respect to such Claim has or would reasonably
be expected to result in Damages in excess of the amounts available for
indemnification pursuant to this Article X, and (y) the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ one separate co-counsel and to participate in
the defense in such action or proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel, if,
based on advice from counsel, there exists any actual or potential conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the defense of the third-party Claim. In any event, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their respective counsel
shall cooperate in the defense of any third-party Claim subject to this
Article X and keep each other informed of all significant developments
relating to any such third-party Claim, and provide copies of all relevant
correspondence and documentation relating thereto.

SECTION 10.07. _Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery_. No Claim for
indemnification shall be made or have any validity unless the Indemnified
Party shall have given written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party
prior to the date set forth in Section 10.01 for such Claim (or Section
7.08(g) with respect to any claim made pursuant to Section 7.08). This Article
X and Sections 6.05(e), 6.11, 7.01(b), 7.01(c), 7.08 and 8.01(d) provide the
exclusive means by which a party may assert and remedy claims for monetary
relief pursuant to this Agreement following the Principal Closing Date (other
than disputes related to the Price Adjustment Statement or Allocation, which
shall be governed by the terms of Sections 2.04 and 2.05, respectively),
including any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, and Section 11.12 provides the exclusive means by
which a party may bring actions against the other party under this Agreement.
Each party hereby waives and releases any other remedies or claims that it may
have against the other party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to the
matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or relating to
the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Equity Interests or the Transferred
Company, except that any limitations herein shall not apply (a) for the
remedies of injunctive relief or specific performance set forth herein; (b)
with respect to the covenants that by their respective terms anticipate
performance following the Applicable Closing Date; and (c) as otherwise
expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreements. With respect to any Damages
arising under this Agreement, (x) Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such
Damages from Seller and the Asset Selling Affiliates (other than in connection
with claims for successor liability or fraudulent

 



90  conveyance), and Buyer hereby waives the right to seek Damages from or
equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, against any Affiliate of Seller
(other than the Asset Selling Affiliates) ( _other than_ in connection with
claims for successor liability or fraudulent conveyance) or any director,
officer or employee of Seller (or any of its Affiliates) and (y) Seller agrees
that it shall only seek such Damages from Buyer, and Seller hereby waives the
right to seek Damages from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief,
against any Affiliate of Buyer or any director, officer or employee of Buyer
(or any of its Affiliates). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled
to indemnification under this Article X or under Section 7.08(d) with respect
to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.04.

SECTION 10.08. _Calculation of Damages_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Article X (or, in the case of any and all Tax matters, in Section 7.08(d)), in
any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from third parties
any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnifying Party
has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X (or, in the case of any and all
Tax matters, to Section 7.08(d)), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay
over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
matter. The computation of the amount of any indemnity payment required to be
made pursuant to this Article X (or, in the case of any and all Tax matters,
to Section 7.08(d)) shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax benefit, if any,
actually realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of incurring the
liability at issue net of any Tax costs incurred by the Indemnified Party
relating or attributable to the receipt of such indemnity payment; _provided_
that, if such net Tax benefit is determined after the applicable indemnity
payment is made pursuant to this Article X (or, in the case of any and all Tax
matters, to Section 7.08(d)), the Indemnified Party shall repay to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the
Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article X (or,
in the case of any and all Tax matters, to Section 7.08(d)) had such
determination been made at the time of such payment

 

SECTION 10.09. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law.

ARTICLE XI

 

 _Miscellaneous_

SECTION 11.01. _Own Due Diligence_. Buyer is conducting its own
investigation, examination and valuation of the Business, including the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Equity Interests, in effecting the
transactions covered by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
Buyer has made all inspections and investigations of the Business and the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Equity Interests deemed necessary or
desirable by Buyer. In light of these inspections and investigations and the
representations and warranties made to Buyer by Seller herein, Buyer is
relinquishing any right to any claim based on any representations and
warranties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



91 SECTION 11.02. _Financial Information and Projections_. (a) In connection
with Buyers investigation of the Business, Buyer has received from Seller
various forward-looking statements regarding the Business (including the
estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and plans furnished to it)
(the " _Forward-Looking Statements_ "). Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i)
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make the Forward-Looking
Statements, (ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and (iii)
Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to, and Buyer is not
relying on any representations, express or implied, with respect to, the
Forward-Looking Statement or the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
any Forward-Looking Statement.

SECTION 11.03. _To the knowledge_. "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Affiliates means
the actual knowledge of those individuals set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
11.03_.

 

SECTION 11.04. _Waivers_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Applicable Closing, the parties hereto may by written agreement signed by
both parties, (a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the
performance of any obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or statement of any
party hereto or (c) waive any condition or compliance with any covenant
contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 11.05. _Modifications and Amendments_. This Agreement shall not be
altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Assignability, Beneficiaries, Governing Law and Enforcement_.
(a) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but this Agreement shall not be assignable
by either party hereto without the express written consent of the other party
hereto, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ that, without such consent, either party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate at any time, or to a third party
in connection with a sale or transfer (by means of a merger, stock sale or
otherwise) of all or substantially all of Buyers business or Sellers
business, respectively; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that such
assigning party shall not be relieved of its obligations hereunder in the
event of such assignment to an Affiliate. Other than as explicitly set forth
herein, including in Sections 10.02 and 10.03, nothing contained herein is
intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement, and all claims or causes
of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by the law of the State of
New York without reference to the choice of law doctrine of such state.

 



92 (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement without proof of actual damages, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party further
agrees that (i) no other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 11.06, and
each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument and
(ii) it will not oppose the granting of such remedy.
