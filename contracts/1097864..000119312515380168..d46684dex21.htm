corporation (" _Parent_ "), Falcon Operations Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ ")
and Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ "). All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in _Annex I_ or as otherwise defined
elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise.
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein
as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to commence a
tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ " or, such shares, " _Company Shares_ ") for the
consideration and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, the Parties wish to effect the acquisition of the
Company by Parent through the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, this Agreement expressly requires the Merger to be governed by
Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ") and provides that the Merger shall be effected as soon as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer if the Merger is effected
under Section 251(h) of the DGCL (unless Section 251(h) of the DGCL is
inapplicable);

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of the Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ "), including the
Offer, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement,
(iii) adopted and approved the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements
contained herein and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and
(iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Acquisition
Sub pursuant to the Offer or, solely in the case that Section 251(h) of the
DGCL is inapplicable, adopt the Agreement (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ "); WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition Sub have approved
this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective stockholders;
and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also
prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to applicable law and
provided that this Agreement shall not have been validly terminated pursuant
to _Article IX_, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no
event later than December 4, 2015), Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the
Company Shares. In the Offer, each Company Share accepted by Acquisition Sub
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall
be exchanged for the right to receive $20.00 in cash (the " _Offer Price_ ").
The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of the holders of Company Shares and
contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in _Annex
II_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and
thereof. The Offer shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the expiration
of the Offer, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with
the terms of the Offer a number of Company Shares that, together with the
Company Shares then owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub (if any), represents
at least a majority of all then outstanding Company Shares (excluding Company
Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been "received," as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by
the depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures); and

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex II_.

(b) Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company in its sole discretion, Acquisition Sub shall not (and Parent
shall not permit Acquisition Sub to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, or

 



-2-  any of the conditions set forth in clauses (A), (B) or (D)(1) of _Annex II_
and (ii) make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A)
changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B) except as
contemplated by Section 3.1(d), decreases the Offer Price or the number of
Company Shares sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other than in a
manner required by the provisions of _Section 1.1(c)_, (D) imposes
conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex II_, (E)
modifies the conditions set forth in _Annex II_ or (F) amends any other term
or condition of the Offer in any manner that is adverse to the holders of
Company Shares.

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, at the
time that is one (1) minute following 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after
the date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall
expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.1(c)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, without the consent of the Company:

(A) Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend
the Offer for any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ, in any such
case, which is applicable to the Offer;

 

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex
II_ (including the Minimum Condition) have not been satisfied or waived as of
any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend the Offer for successive extension
periods of up to ten (10) business days each (or, in the case that any such
ten (10) business day extension would extend beyond the Outside Date, then
such extension shall be made only to the second (2nd) business day prior to
the Outside Date) in order to further seek to satisfy such conditions
(including the Minimum Condition); and

(C) (1) in the event that (in the case of the initial Financing Extension
Notice) all of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex II_ (including
(x) the Minimum Condition and (y) the condition set forth in clause (D)(5) of
_Annex II_ that the Company shall have furnished Parent with a certificate
signed on its behalf of any of the Companys chairman of the board, its chief
executive officer or any individual listed on _Section A_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the effect that the conditions set forth in clauses
(D)(2), (D)(3) and (D)(4) of _Annex II_ have not occurred) have been satisfied
or waived as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, and (2) in the
event that Parent and Acquisition Sub are in compliance in all material
respects with their respective covenants and agreements under _Section 7.13_
and Parent or Acquisition Sub have been and remain unable to obtain proceeds
of financing in an amount sufficient (together with any funds available
to Parent or Acquisition Sub) to consummate the Transactions on the date on
which the Acceptance Time would otherwise occur (such financing, the "
_Requisite Financing_ "), Acquisition Sub shall be entitled (A) by written
notice from the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer of Parent
to the Company no later than 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the next business day
after the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer that certifies that (1)
Parent and Acquisition Sub have complied in all material respects with their
respective covenants and agreements in _Section 7.13_, (2) Parent has been
and remains unable to obtain the Requisite Financing as of the date that the
Acceptance Time would otherwise be required to occur and (3) Acquisition Sub
is delivering such notice solely to extend the Offer to obtain the Requisite
Financing (such certified written notice, a " _Financing Extension Notice_ "),
to extend the Offer to such later time specified by Parent in the Financing
Extension Notice (except that in no event shall such extension exceed ten (10)
business days and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not be entitled to extend
the expiration to a date that is later than two (2) business days prior to
November 18, 2016). Acquisition Sub shall be permitted to deliver multiple
Financing Extension Notices to the Company (except that in no event shall any
extension pursuant to any such Financing Extension Notice exceed ten (10)
business days and Parent shall not be entitled to extend the expiration to a
date that is later than two (2) business days prior to November 18, 2016);

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that any such extension shall not be deemed to
impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parties
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_ and if, at
the time of the applicable expiration date, all of the conditions to the Offer
set forth on _Annex II_ (other than the Minimum Condition) are
satisfied, all comments of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or
the Offer Documents have been resolved and no rule, regulation or
interpretation of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer would require
Parent or Acquisition Sub to extend the Offer, then Acquisition Sub shall
only be required to extend the Offer and its expiration date beyond the then-
existing expiration date for up to two additional periods not to exceed an
aggregate of twenty (20) business days to permit the Minimum Condition to be
satisfied.

 



-3- (iii) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 1.1(c)(ii)_ without the prior written
consent of the Company.

(iv) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Acquisition
Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one
(1) business day) after such termination of this Agreement.

(d)  _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company
Shares that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended
in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)(ii)_) (such time, the " _Acceptance Time_
"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary
to pay for any Company Shares that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the
prior written consent of the Company, Acquisition Sub shall not accept for
payment or pay for any Company Shares if, as a result, Acquisition Sub would
acquire less than the number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the
Minimum Condition. The consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall
be paid net to the holder thereof in cash subject to reduction for any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof. If payment of the
Offer Price is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered certificate evidencing Company Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Offer Price to a Person other than the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Acquisition Sub that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

(e)  _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_.

(i) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is first commenced (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall:

(1) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which
Schedule TO shall contain (A) as an exhibit or incorporate by reference the
Offer to Purchase and forms of the letter(s) of transmittal and summary
advertisement, if any, and other customary ancillary documents, in each case,
in respect of the Offer and (B) notice to holders of Company Shares informing
such holders of their rights of appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ");

 



-4- (2) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to the
Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act;

 

(3) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Schedule TO, to NASDAQ in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

 

(4) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company
Shares as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.2_, the Offer Documents may
include a description of the determinations, approvals and recommendations of
the Company Board of Directors set forth in _Section 1.2(a)_ that relate to
the Offer. The Company shall furnish in writing to Parent and Acquisition Sub
all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required
by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Acquisition Sub or Parent to be
included in the Offer Documents so as to enable Parent and Acquisition Sub to
comply with their obligations under this _Section 1.1(e)_.
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to
determine the information regarding the Company that is necessary to include
in the Offer Documents in order to satisfy applicable Law. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or any of its respective Representatives for use in the Offer
Documents to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Company Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Law, or by the SEC or
its staff or NASDAQ. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made
by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall (A) provide
in writing to the Company and its counsel any and all written comments that
Parent, Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after such receipt, (B)
provide a reasonably detailed description of any oral comments Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after such receipt, and (C) unless
there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide the Company and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any such response, to which Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made
by the Company and its counsel) and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and the SEC and its staff, to participate in any discussions with the SEC
or its staff regarding any such comments.

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 3.1. _Treatment of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The holders of
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-_

 



-9-   _Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Company Share shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Share other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement, the
Merger Consideration, or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Each Company Share held by the
Company as treasury stock (or by any wholly owned subsidiary thereof) or held
by Parent or Acquisition Sub (or by any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such Company Shares
collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement and other than as contemplated by
this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), division or
subdivision of shares or other similar transaction, or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), the identity and the terms of
appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the
payment of the funds to which holders of such shares of Company Common Stock
shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Parent (or the Surviving
Corporation, after the Effective Time) shall pay the fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent. At or prior to each of the Acceptance Time and the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause
Acquisition Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent all of the funds necessary
to make the aggregate payments of the Merger Consideration due under _Section
3.1_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1_, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to
make such payments. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) applied
promptly to making the payments pursuant to  _Section 3.2(c)_ hereof. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

 



-10- (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the third (3rd) business day
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (or
to make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares and whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (x)
a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify, and (y) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
applicable merger consideration into which the number of Company Shares
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide
that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be collected by hand by the
surrendering holder or by wire transfer to the surrendering holder). In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered are registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be
properly transferred and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other
documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in
an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of
the number of Company Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.2(c)_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Company
Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any
interest thereon.

 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter

 



-11-  there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of Company Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise provided herein. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed,
or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents
routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and in compliance with the procedures in
_Section 3.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger
Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and in
compliance with the other procedures set forth in this Section 3.2 (other than
the surrender of the Certificate) and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ hereof.

Section 3.3. _Dissenter s Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has properly exercised
appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect
to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of such consideration
as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Company Shares shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificates formerly representing
such Company Shares or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be.

 



-12- (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demand, or agree to do any such appraisal demands.

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) Each option to purchase Company Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested) and be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Company Share of such Company Option by (ii) the total
number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option. Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Options the
cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any other
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
such payment, within five (5) business days following the Effective Time.

(b) Each award of restricted stock units denominated in Company Shares (each,
a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the
extent unvested) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the total number of Company
Shares subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of
Company RSU Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding
sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to such payment, within five (5) business days following the
Effective Time (or, if applicable, such later date required by Section 409A of
the Code).

 

(c) Each award of performance units denominated in Company Shares (each, a "
_Company PU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent
unvested) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the total number of Company
Shares subject to such Company PU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration. In
the case of Company PU Awards that are subject to performance periods that are
ongoing as of the Effective Time, performance conditions shall be deemed
satisfied at the greater of target and actual performance (as determined by
the Company Board) as of the Effective Time. Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company PU Awards the
cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less

 



-13-  such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect
to such payment, within five (5) business days following the Effective Time
(or, if applicable, such later date required by Section 409A of the Code).

(d) Each award of deferred stock units denominated in Company Shares (each, a
" _Company DSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the
extent unvested) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the total number of Company
Shares subject to such Company DSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of
Company DSU Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding
sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to such payment, within five (5) business days following the
Effective Time (or, if applicable, such later date required by Section 409A of
the Code).

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or
appropriate action to effectuate the actions contemplated by this  _Section
3.4_.

Section 3.5. _Withholding_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards pursuant to this
Agreement, any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with
respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes

officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (a) all

Time and at the Closing, all funds necessary to consummate the Transactions
and satisfy all of their obligations hereunder, including the payment of the
aggregate Offer Price and aggregate Merger Consideration and the obligations
of Parent pursuant to  _Section 3.4_, and to pay any fees and expenses of or
payable by Parent, Acquisition Sub, and the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Aggregate Cash Amount_ "). In no event shall the receipt or availability of
any funds or financing by Parent or Acquisition Sub or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Acquisition Subs
obligations hereunder.

 

(b) Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter
dated November 18, 2015 (attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , and together with
the fee letters referred to in the following sentence, the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ ") from the financial institution or institutions identified therein
(in their capacity as such, the " _Debt Providers_ ") pursuant to which the
Debt Providers have agreed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt
Financing_ "). Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and any fee letters related
thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee
and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection
with transactions of this type and that could not in any event affect the
availability or amount of the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, the respective obligations
and commitments contained in such letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect, and to the knowledge of Parent, no

 



-34-  such amendment, modification, withdrawal, or rescission is contemplated. The
existence or exercise of the "flex" provisions contained in the fee letters
delivered to the Company with respect thereto shall not constitute an
amendment or modification of the Commitment Letter. Parent or Acquisition Sub
has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with
the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and
will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date.

effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
subject to Enforceability Limitations. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
failure to satisfy a condition by Parent or a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Acquisition Sub or any other parties thereto under the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any fact,
occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect, nor
does it have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or that the
Debt Financing will not be available to Parent or Acquisition Sub on or
before the date of the Closing; _provided_ that Parent is not making any
representation regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV or compliance by the Company with its
obligations hereunder. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Providers to make the Debt
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein, and there are no other
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing or
contingencies that would permit the Debt Providers to reduce the total amount
of the Debt Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating
to the availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision.
As of the date hereof, there are no side letters, understandings,
arrangements, or Contracts (other than the Debt Commitment Letter) between
Parent or any of its affiliates and any of the Debt Providers or
their respective affiliates related to the Debt Financing, except for any
customary engagement letters in respect of the Debt Financing that do not
impact the availability, conditionality or amount of the Debt Financing.

 

(d) The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with the funds available to Parent, will provide Parent with
cash proceeds at the Acceptance Time and on the Closing Date sufficient to pay
the Aggregate Cash Amount.

Section 5.8.  _Finders and Brokers_. Other than Deutsche Bank Securities,
Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or
finder in connection with the Transactions who might be entitled to any fee
or any commission in connection with this Agreement or upon consummation of
the Offer and the Merger.

 

Section 5.9. _Stock Ownership_. Parent is not, nor at any time for the past
three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
directly or indirectly owns, and at all times for the past three (3) years,
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has owned, beneficially or
otherwise, any Company Shares.

 



-35- Section 5.10. _No Acquisition Sub Activity_. Since the date of Acquisition
Subs formation, Acquisition Sub has not engaged in any activities other than
in connection with its formation and this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

Section 5.11. _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by any applicable Law, Parent Governing Documents or the
applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in
order for Parent to consummate the Transactions.

 

Section 5.12. _Solvency_. As of the Closing Date, immediately after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Debt Financing), and assuming (i) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Article IV and (ii) the performance in all material respects by the Company
of its obligations hereunder:

(a) neither the Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis nor
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis are
insolvent (whether because its financial condition is such that the sum of its
debts is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair
saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts as they mature, or otherwise);

(b) each of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis taken as a

notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no

In addition, for the sake of clarity, Parent does not have the right to direct

Section 6.2.  _Solicitation by the Company_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Acceptance Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, and except as otherwise specifically
provided for in this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall not (and
shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to), and that it shall not authorize
or knowingly permit its directors, officers, employees and other
Representatives to: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes or would be
reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (other than the
Company Board Recommendation), (iv) enter into any letter of intent, merger

Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 6.2_), (v) take any action to make
any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any Person or any Acquisition Proposal,
other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, the Offer and the Merger, (vi)
otherwise make any Change of Recommendation, or (vii) agree to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Companys
Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms
and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any Person to determine
whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal and (B) inform a
Person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this  _Section 6.2_.
Subject to _Section 6.2(b)_, the Company and its officers and directors
shall, and the Company shall instruct the Companys Representatives, the
Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives to, immediately cease all
discussions and

 



-41-  negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an actual
or potential Acquisition Proposal and promptly request each such Person to
return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person on
behalf of the Company in connection with any such actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_, but
subject to compliance with _Sections 6.2(c)_ and _Section 6.2(e)_ hereof, if
the Company receives, following the date hereof but prior to the
Acceptance Time, an unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal from any Person
that did not result from a breach by the Company of _Section 6.2(a)_ and that
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, then in either event the Company may take the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall notify Parent orally
and in writing promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours)
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any proposals or inquiries that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected
to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and the
material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of
the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request and shall attach
a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal (or summary of the terms of any
oral Acquisition Proposal) and related materials provided to the Company or
its Representatives. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status (including by providing notice of any meeting of the Company Board of
Directors at which the Company Board of Directors considered any Acquisition
Proposal as soon as practicable (including prior to such meeting if
practicable) and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours thereof) and
material terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such
material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal (including promptly after receipt providing to Parent copies of
any additional or revised written proposals or indications of intent) and
keep Parent reasonably informed as to the nature of any information requested
of the Company with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly provide to
Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the Company provided to
any other Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not
previously provided to Parent.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section 6.2(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation in
connection with an Intervening Event (other than for a Superior Proposal) if
the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, or (ii) make a Change of

 



-42-  Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(g)_ in order to enter into an definitive agreement in connection
with an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, which the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and financial advisors, in light of such Superior Proposal,
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
6.2(d)(i)_, (A) the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Change
of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor,
and during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall make its
Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith any proposal
by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (B) at the
end of the three (3) business day period, the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation,
in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account any adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to or proposed by Parent, as
a result of any discussions or negotiations, would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, or (ii) under _Section 6.2(d)(ii)_, (A) the Company shall
provide Parent with three (3) business days prior written notice advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and
attaching the most current draft of any written agreement providing for the
transactions contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal (including all
ancillary agreements and any financing commitments), and during such three (3)
business day period, the Company shall make its Representatives available to
discuss and negotiate in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) at the end of the three (3)
business day period, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith
that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation, after taking into account
any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to or
proposed by Parent as a result of any discussions or negotiations, would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach by the Company Board of Directors of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , each time a
material modification to the terms of an Alternative Proposal determined to be
a Superior Proposal is made (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms shall be deemed to be
a material modification), the Company shall notify Parent of such modification
and the time period set forth in _Section 6.2(e)(ii)(B) _shall recommence
and be extended for three (3) business days from the day of such notification.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), or
making a statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making
any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors has
reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the Company Board of Directors fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under 

 



-43-  applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 6.2(g)_ shall not permit the
Company Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation except to the
extent permitted by  _Section 6.2(d)_ or _Section 6.2(e)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation.

ARTICLE VII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 7.1. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section
9.1_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to afford to Parent and
to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, employees, offices, books and records and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish
reasonably promptly to Parent all information (financial or otherwise)
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by
this _Section 7.1_ to provide the other Party or the Representatives of such
other Party with access to or to disclose information (A) the disclosure of
which would violate the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the extent that such access or
disclosure does not result in such violation), (B) the disclosure of which
would violate any Law or duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or
duty) or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the
maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege). Each of the Company and
Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption
to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the requests for
access, data and information hereunder.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger

 



-44-  or other Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the
other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such Party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any legal proceeding or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any investigation, commenced or, to any Partys
knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case in connection with,
arising from or otherwise relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other
Transaction or (iii) any representation or warranty made in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in _Annex II_
would not be satisfied or of any failure to comply with any covenant to be
complied with under this Agreement such that the conditions in _Annex II_
would not be satisfied. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in _Annex II_ or give rise to any
right to terminate under _Article IX_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, at Parents expense, in (but not control) the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation or claims against the
Company or any of its directors relating to the Offer or the Merger, in each
case which seek to prohibit, restrain or modify the terms of the Transactions.
The Company shall not settle or agree to settle any litigation against the
Company or any director by any stockholder relating to this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger, without the prior written consent of Parent.

 

(d) The Company and Parent shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to)
use their respective reasonable best efforts to not take any action that may
cause, directly or indirectly, Section 251(h) of the DGCL to be in applicable
to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to
_Sections 7.2(b)_ , _7.2(c)_ and _7.2(d)_ , each Party will cooperate with
each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to use) its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i)
preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as
practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents
and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, registrations, approvals, and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,

not limited to, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and to supply as
promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Entity pursuant
to any applicable Antitrust Law, including, but

 



-45-  not limited to, the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods and to obtain
any other required consents, clearances, registrations, approvals, and
authorizations as soon as practicable. Subject to _Sections 7.2(b)_ , _7.2(c)_
and _7.2(d)_ , neither Parent nor Company shall take or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.2(d)_, applicable Law and all
applicable privileges (including the attorney-client privilege) and except as
prohibited by any Governmental Entity, each of Parent and the Company shall,
in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 7.2(a)_ to obtain all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for
the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate
in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing
the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other
Party of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party
to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "),
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental
Entity, by promptly providing copies to the other Party of any such written
communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent not prohibited by the
DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person,
give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-
person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or
other Person;  _provided_ , _however_ , that materials required to be
provided pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in
_Section 7.2(a)_ and _Section 7.2(b)_, the Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to contest and defend against the entry of, or to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the Outside Date,
including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any
court with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private
party.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in 
_Section 7.2(a)_ and _Section 7.2(b)_, the Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law so as to enable the Closing to 

 



-46-  occur as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking
or committing to take actions or accept conditions that after the Closing
Date would limit Parents, the Companys and their respective Subsidiaries
freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or
more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
Closing. Parent and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to
divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take
any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or Parent or
the Parent Subsidiaries ability to retain, any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any such action is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary shall be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect,
or accept any of the actions specified in this _Section 7.2(d)_ if such
actions would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material and adverse effect on the business, product lines, or
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B)
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be required to propose,
negotiate, commit to, effect, or accept any obligation to, divest, dispose of
or hold separate any assets, product lines or businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries if such divestitures, dispositions or holding separate
requirements would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a divestiture,
disposition or holding separate of assets, product lines or business
accounting for five percent (5%) or more of the consolidated gross revenues of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries during the last completed fiscal year period.

 

Section 7.3. _Publicity_. Subject to _Section 6.2(f)_, neither the Company
nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates or Representatives, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without
the prior consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by
any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis
reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the
other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement in advance and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be required by this  _Section 7.3_ to provide any
such review or comment to Parent following a Change of Recommendation and
matters related thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties shall not
be required by this _Section 7.3_ to provide any such review or comment to
the other Party in the event of any material dispute between the Parties
relating to this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party and their
respective affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section 7.3_.

 



-47- Section 7.4. _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all
past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law; _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to
return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not
ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions), asserted or claimed against the applicable Indemnified
Party, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director,
employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time or of any Person if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company
Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary
or any indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of
the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in
any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified
Party notifies Parent or the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.4_, the provisions of
this _Section 7.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until
the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto.

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company
Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary
and (ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such
provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified
Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions).

 



-48- (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D
andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy
or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium
tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement. 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.4_. The rights and obligations under
this  _Section 7.4_ shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Merger
and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

(e) The Indemnified Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.4_.

 

Section 7.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 7.6. _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.7. _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the date of this Agreement. Effective as of the Effective Time and for a
period of no less than one (1) year thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company
and/or the Company Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the

 



-49-  Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "): (i) annual rates of base salaries or wage levels and annual
target cash incentive opportunities (and in respect of which, for the
Companys fiscal year ending in 2016, the applicable performance metrics shall
be adjusted reasonably and in good faith to reflect the fact that the Company
shall cease to be a publicly traded entity) which, in each case, shall be no
less favorable than those provided to the Continuing Employees by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) equity-incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no
less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries and (iii) all other compensation and employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided
to employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for such one (1)-year period following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide any Continuing Employee who experiences a termination of employment
under circumstances that would have entitled such Continuing Employee to
severance benefits under either the severance plan or policy of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or a severance plan or policy of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries applicable to similarly situated employees
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries at the time of such termination,
with severance benefits at a level at least equal to the greater of those
that would have been provided under the either such severance plan or policy.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and Parent Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent will ensure that each
Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that
the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) with respect to benefit accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare benefit plan, or (iii)
with respect to any newly established New Plan for which prior service is not
taken into account for employees of Parent or any of its affiliates. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and to the
extent permitted under applicable Law, (x) each Continuing Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), and (y) for purposes of each New Plan providing welfare
benefits (including medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits) to
any Continuing Employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date

 



-50-  such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

(d) Prior to the date on which the Company becomes an ERISA Affiliate of
Parent (but not earlier than ten (10) business days prior to such date), the
Company shall (unless otherwise instructed by Parent at least fifteen (15)
business days prior to the date on which the Company becomes an ERISA
Affiliate of Parent) terminate each Company Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a " _401(k) Plan_ ") that includes
a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code effective as of no later than the day immediately prior to the date on
which the Company becomes an ERISA Affiliate of Parent, with such termination
subject to the Company becoming an ERISA Affiliate of Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
New Plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to promptly accept
rollovers of account balances from such 401(k) Plan, inclusive of any
outstanding loan balances thereunder and related promissory notes of Company
Employees. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such plan(s) have been terminated by providing resolutions
approving such termination. The form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to the review and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) Each cash-based long-term award (each, a " _Company LTIP Award_ ") listed
on Section 7.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested as of the
Effective Time and shall be settled within five (5) calendar days following
the Effective Time. In the case of Company LTIP Awards that are subject to
performance periods that are ongoing as of the Effective Time, performance
conditions shall be deemed satisfied at the greater of target and actual
performance (as determined by the Company Board) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (and any Company RSU Award that may be issued as a result
thereof shall be treated in the same manner as all other Company RSU Awards
in accordance with Section 3.4(b) above).

(f) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate
amount of $15 million to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to
consummate the Closing (the " _Retention Program_ ") with any such payments
from such Retention Program to be paid immediately prior to the
Effective Time or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment.
Amounts under the Retention Program shall be allocated among the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries identified, and in the amounts and on
such other terms as determined, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
(or his designees). If a retention award or portion thereof under the
Retention Program is forfeited by a participant, the Chief Executive Officer
of the Company (or his designees) may reallocate the retention award (or
unpaid portion thereof) to existing employees or new hires of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

 



-51- (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan of any of Acquisition Sub, or (ii) create any third party rights
in any current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates
(or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 7.8.  _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and
Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.9.  _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each
director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and effective upon the Effective Time.

Section 7.10. _14d-10 Matters_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments
have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are
to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans
(collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of Company Shares
and holders of Company Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (a) at
a meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will duly adopt
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act (i) each Arrangement presented to the Company Compensation
Committee on or prior to the date hereof, (ii) the treatment of the Company
Equity Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement, and (iii) the terms of _Section 7.4_ and _Section 7.7_, and (b)
will take all other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with
respect to the foregoing arrangements. Each member of the Company Compensation
Committee is an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.11. _Stockholder Meeting_. In the event that Section 251(h) of the
DGCL is inapplicable to the Merger, then Parent and the Company shall as
promptly as practicable, (a) prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement in connection with noticing and convening a
meeting of the holders of Company Shares for purposes of obtaining from such
holders of the Company Shares the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger (a " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), (b) resolve any comments to such
preliminary proxy statement (if any) from the SEC (and the Company shall
notify Parent of any such comments from, or correspondence with, the SEC
regarding the proxy statement and afford Parent and its

 



-52-  counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such SEC
comments and responses thereto prior to filing with the SEC) and mail the
definitive proxy statement to holders of Company Shares, (c) set a record
date for a Stockholders Meeting, (d) vote all Company Shares received by
Acquisition Sub in the Offer in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger, and (e) cause the meeting to be held in
accordance with applicable Law and cause the Merger to be effected pursuant to
Section 251 or Section 253 of the DGCL. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company shall include in the proxy statement, and not
subsequently withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board of
Directors that the stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
and the other Transactions and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain such approval. From the Acceptance Time until the consummation of the
Merger, in no event shall Parent amend (or permit to be amended) any provision
of this Agreement in any manner which would (i) alter or change the amount or
form of the Merger Consideration or (ii) otherwise adversely affect the
holders of Company Shares. All holders of Company Shares after the Acceptance
Time shall be express third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 7.11_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the
Merger cannot be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and Parent,
Acquisition Sub and any other Parent Subsidiary holds in the aggregate at
least ninety percent (90%) of the then issued and outstanding Company Shares
immediately following the consummation of the Offer, then each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

Section 7.12. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall take such actions reasonably required to cause the Company Shares to be
de-listed from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.13. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not permit any amendment, modification,
supplement, or replacement to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without the consent of the Company if
such amendment, modification, supplement, replacement or waiver (i) reduces
(or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing)
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands or adversely amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing, (iii) would modify the confidentiality
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter in any respect or (iv) would
reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay, prevent, or impede the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Financing) or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Definitive Financing Agreements (as defined below) ( _provided_ that
Parent and Acquisition Sub may amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letter to
add or replace lenders, arrangers or similar entities so long as such action
would not reasonably be expected to materially delay, prevent, or impede the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Financing) or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the

 



-53-  other Transactions, or adversely impact Parents or Acquisition Subs
ability to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter). Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of
this Agreement, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended or
modified by this _Section 7.13(a)_ and references to "Definitive Financing
Agreements" or "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as
amended or modified in accordance with this  _Section 7.13(a)_.

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter by
the Acceptance Time (assuming, for the purposes hereof, that (a) in the event
that no Financing Extension Notices have been delivered, that no such
Financing Extension Notices will be delivered and that the Acceptance Time
will occur on the date, as reasonably estimated by the Parties, on which all
conditions set forth on _Annex II_ related to Antitrust Laws have been
satisfied, and (b) in the event that one or more Financing Extension Notices
have been delivered, that the Acceptance Time will occur no later than 9:00
a.m. Eastern Time on the business day immediately following the then scheduled
expiration date of the Offer), including by using their reasonable best
efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii)
to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms (subject
to the limitations contained in _Section 7.13(a)_) that would not reasonably
be expected to materially prevent or delay the Offer, the Merger, and the
other Transactions or the date on which the Debt Financing could be obtained
or make the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing less likely to
occur on or prior to the Acceptance Time (assuming, for the purposes hereof,
that (a) in the event that no Financing Extension Notices have been delivered,
that no such Financing Extension Notices will be delivered and (b) in the
event that one or more Financing Extension Notices have been delivered, that
the Acceptance Time will occur no later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the
business day immediately following the then scheduled expiration date of the
Offer), (iii) to comply on a timely basis with (or obtain any waiver of) their
covenants and obligations set forth in, and satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on
a timely basis all conditions to the funding in, the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Debt Financing Agreements, in each case, as necessary to consummate
the Transactions and satisfy all obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub
pursuant to this Agreement, including to pay the aggregate Offer Price at the
Acceptance Time and the aggregate Merger Consideration on the Closing Date and
satisfy the obligations of Parent under _Section 3.4_, and to pay any fees
and expenses of or payable by Parent, Acquisition Sub, and the
Surviving Corporation. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements have been satisfied,
Parent shall cause the Debt Providers thereunder to comply with their
respective obligations, including to fund the Debt Financing required to
consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date, including to pay the
aggregate Offer Price at the Acceptance Time and the aggregate Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date and satisfy the obligations of Parent under
_Section 3.4_, and to pay any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent,
Acquisition Sub, and the Surviving Corporation (including by promptly
commencing a litigation proceeding against any breaching Debt Provider to
compel such Debt Provider to provide its portion of the Debt Financing or
otherwise comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter or
Definitive Financing Agreements). Parent and Acquisition Sub shall comply with
their obligations, and enforce their rights, under the Debt Commitment Letter
and Definitive Financing Agreements in a timely and diligent matter. In each
case promptly upon the Companys request to Parent and Acquisition Sub, Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall (A) provide to the Company copies of all
substantially final drafts and executed definitive agreements for the Debt
Financing Agreements (excluding any provisions related solely to fees and
other economic terms), and (ii) keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

 



-54- (c) In the event that, at any time prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter is terminated for any reason, (ii) Parent or Acquisition
Sub becomes aware of any material breach or default by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreement, (iii) a counterparty
provides notice that it will not provide, or it refuses to provide, all or
any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, or (iv) any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable for any reason, Parent will (A) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Debt
Financing, to consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date and satisfy all
of the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder, including the
payment of the aggregate Offer Price at the Acceptance Time and the aggregate
Merger consideration on the Closing Date and Parents obligations under 
_Section 3.4_, and to pay any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent,
Acquisition Sub, and the Surviving Corporation) from the same or other sources
and which does not include any conditions to the consummation of such
alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and Definitive Financing Agreements and
(B) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason
therefor; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Acquisition Sub be
under any obligation to disclose any information that (A) is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a manner
that would not waive such privilege, or (B) would contravene any Law. In
furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (1)
any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield bond financing
shall become unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor and (2) all
conditions contained in _Annex II_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than (x) any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
expiration of the Offer, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the expiration of the Offer, and (y) those conditions the
failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent or
Acquisition Sub of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), and (3) the term loan credit facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or alternative facilities obtained
in accordance with this Section 7.13) are available on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (or replacements thereof),
then each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause the proceeds of such term
financing to be used immediately in lieu of such affected portion of the high
yield bond financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include any alternative financing arranged in compliance
herewith (and any Debt Financing pursuant to any Debt Commitment Letter or
Definitive Financing Agreement remaining in effect at the time in question),
and references to "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Definitive Financing
Agreements" shall include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with
respect thereto and any definitive documents or agreements with respect
thereto, respectively (and any Debt Commitment Letter and Definitive Financing
Agreements, respectively, remaining in effect at the time in question).
Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of any breach or
default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing
Agreements and the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Debt Provider or other financing source with respect
to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement of any provision
thereof.

 



-55- (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) Parents
and Acquisition Subs obligations hereunder shall not constitute a condition
to the consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) compliance by Parent and
Acquisition Sub with this _Section 7.13_ shall not relieve Parent of
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Debt Financing is available.

 

Section 7.14. _Financing Cooperation._

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall provide,
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, to Parent and
Acquisition Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Acquisition
Sub in connection with the consummation, arrangement, marketing and
syndication of the Debt Financing or any replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing permitted by this Agreement (collectively with the Debt
Financing, the " _Available Financing_ "), including by using its reasonable
best efforts (i) promptly upon request by Parent, to furnish Parent and
Acquisition Sub the Required Financial Information and such other financial
information other pertinent information and disclosures regarding the Company

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries contained therein),

obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any
agreement, certificate, document or instrument (and no security interest in
any assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) executed in
connection with the Available Financing shall be effective until the Closing,
and (vii) upon the reasonable request of Parent and Acquisition Sub, to
assist Parent and Acquisition Sub in obtaining customary accountants comfort
letters customary for financings similar to the Available Financing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ that would (i) contravene any applicable Law
or require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to disclose
information subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other

cause any officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is not
continuing in such capacity after the Closing to execute any certificate,
document, instrument or agreement), (vii) cause any director, officer, or
employee or stockholder of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any
personal liability, or (viii) unreasonably interfere with the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Nothing in this  _Section 7.14_ or
otherwise shall require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, prior
to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to any of the
Available Financing. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its
and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Available
Financing; _provided_ , that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that
is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise
adversely affect the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company

with such cooperation pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Available Financing, any action
taken by them at the request of Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to this

 



-57-   _Section 7.14_, and any information used in connection therewith (other
than information provided in writing by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 7.14_).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree

obligation of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of any financing (including any Available Financing) to be obtained by Parent
or Acquisition Sub with respect to the Transactions and no other provision of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed
to expand or modify such obligations.

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Acquisition Sub, or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company, as the parties to the
Confidentiality Agreement, hereby agree that the sharing of such confidential
information with, and the use of such information by, the Debt Providers shall
be permitted subject to the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter so
long as such information is disclosed subject to customary confidentiality

-59-  this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action or
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement (including such Partys
obligations set forth in  _Section 7.2_) has been a principal cause of or
resulted in (i) any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex II_
having failed to be satisfied and such action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach of this Agreement or (ii) the expiration or termination of
the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer without

include the benefit of the bargain lost by (x) the Company or its
stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including the total
amount payable to such stockholders under this Agreement and the time value of
money) which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company
(including on behalf of stockholders as third party beneficiaries hereof,
which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall only be enforceable on behalf of such
stockholders by the Company), or (y) Parent, as applicable);
_provided further_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, except in the event that this Agreement
is terminated (1) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ as a result of a
Willful Breach by Parent of _Section 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ or _7.2(c)_ , (2) by
the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ if a Willful Breach by

Transactions to be consummated by the Outside Date and (3) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ if a primary cause of the applicable order,
injunction, decree or ruling (or applicable failure to issue an order,
injunction, decree or ruling) was, or the applicable order, injunction, decree
or ruling (or applicable failure to issue an order, injunction, decree or
ruling) resulted from, Parents Willful Breach of _Section 7.2(a)_ , 
_7.2(b)_ or _7.2(c)_ , the Company (including on behalf of stockholders) shall
not be entitled to recover any amounts, and neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub

), in the event that the Company is entitled to the payment of the Regulatory
Fee and the Regulatory Fee is paid in accordance with _Section 9.2(c)_ );
_provided further_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that the Company is
entitled to payment of and is paid the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.2(d)_ (unless (x) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_  (other than as a result of Parents or
Acquisition Subs inability to obtain the Requisite Financing, except in the
circumstance described in clause (y) of this proviso), or (y) Parents or
Acquisition Subs Willful Breach of  _Section 7.13_ is a material cause of
the failure of such Requisite Financing to be available), the Company
(including on behalf of stockholders) shall not be entitled to recover any
amounts in excess of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

relates to any Antitrust Laws) has been satisfied at the time this Agreement
is terminated, (D) there is no Parent Terminating Breach and (E) any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated within twelve (12) months of such
termination, within two (2) business days after the date any such Acquisition
Proposal is consummated the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $72,000,000
in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Solely for purposes of this _Section
9.2(b)(i)_, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in _Annex I_, except that all references to "15%" or
"85%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(ii) If (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ as
a result of a breach of the Companys covenants or agreements under this
Agreement, and (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been received by the
Company after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, and
(C) any Acquisition Proposal is consummated within twelve (12) months of such
termination, within two (2) business days after the date any Acquisition

Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Annex I_, except
that all references to "15%" or "85%" therein shall be deemed to be references
to "50%".

 



-61- (iii) If (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_
within ten (10) business days following the date on which Parent shall have
become aware of the matter giving rise to the termination right pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)_, then promptly (and in any event within two (2) business
days) after such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to
Parent the Termination Fee; or (B) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_, then immediately prior to (and as a condition
to) such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the
Termination Fee.

(iv) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, payment
of the Termination Fee is not a penalty and shall constitute liquidated
damages as a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Acquisition Sub
in the circumstances upon which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunity foregone with respect to the
consummation of the Transactions which would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision, and from and after such termination as described in
this _Section 9.2(b)_, the Company shall have no further liability or
obligations of any kind in connection with this Agreement or the termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 9.2(b)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) _Regulatory Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, or (ii) (A) by the Company pursuant to

Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_ and, in the case of this
clause (ii), any condition set forth in _Annex II_ (as it relates to any

terminated and all other conditions set forth in  _Annex II_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than the Minimum Condition or any conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer (so long as
such conditions are then capable of fulfillment)), then Parent will, within
two (2) business days following any such termination, pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Company a
fee in the amount of $180,000,000 (the " _Regulatory Fee_ "). In the event
any amount is payable by Parent pursuant to this _Section 9.2(c)_, such
amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall Parent be obligated to pay the Regulatory Fee on more than one
occasion. Except as provided in _Section 9.2(a)_, payment of the Regulatory
Fee is not a penalty and shall constitute liquidated damages as a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances upon which the
Regulatory Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunity foregone with respect to the consummation of the Transactions
which would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and, except
as provided in _Section 9.2(a)_, from and after such termination as described
in this _Section 9.2(c)_, the Company shall have no further liability or
obligations of any kind in connection with this Agreement or the termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 9.2(c)_.

 



-62- (d) _Parent Termination Fee_. If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ , or (ii) (x) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company for any reason (other than a termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or a termination by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_ as a result of a Willful Breach by the Company of its covenants after
the date of any Financing Extension Notice) and (y) prior to such termination,
Parent shall have delivered a Financing Extension Notice, then Parent shall
pay to the Company a termination fee of $215,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "). In the event any amount is payable by Parent pursuant to
this _Section 9.2(d)_ , such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to
pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Except as provided
in _Section 9.2(d)_ , payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.2(d)_ (unless (x) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ (other than as a result of Parents or
Acquisition Subs inability to obtain the Requisite Financing, except in the
circumstance described in clause (y) of this sentence), or (y) Parents or
Acquisition Subs Willful Breach of _Section 7.13_ is a material cause of the
failure of such Requisite Financing to be available) is not a penalty and
shall constitute liquidated damages as a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company in the circumstances upon which the Parent Termination
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunity
foregone with respect to the consummation of the Transactions which would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and, from and after such
termination as described in this sentence, the Company shall have no
further liability or obligations of any kind in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 9.2(d)_.

 

(e) _Integral Part of the Transactions_. Each Party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and that without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent
fails to promptly pay amounts due pursuant to this  _Section 9.2_ and, in
order to obtain such payment Parent or the Company, respectively, commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, respectively,
for the amount of the Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the
Regulatory Fee, respectively, set forth in this _Section 9.2_, the Company or
Parent, respectively, shall pay Parents or the Companys, respectively,
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in the _Wall Street Journal_ from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent or the
Company, as applicable.

hereof. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed
to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation,

Section 10.7. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by

Section 10.8. _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the

by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the

hereof, neither this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and

to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this sentence and
Sections _10.1(c)_ ,  _10.10(a)_ , _10.10(c)_ , _10.11_ , _10.12_ and _10.14_

the extent relating to the Debt Providers).

Section 10.9.  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this

public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offers and the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.10. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state;
provided, however, except as otherwise provided in the Debt Commitment Letter,
that any legal suit, action, litigation, proceeding or claim against any Debt
Provider (whether in law or equity or in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect
to any choice of law or conflicts of laws rules or provisions (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and
only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate
court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively

 



-66-  do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of

maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 10.10(b)_ in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 10.5_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

Parties irrevocably agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or nature
(whether in law, in contract in tort or otherwise) relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby against any Debt Provider in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating to the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby, anywhere other than in the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (and, in each case, the appellate courts
thereof) and agrees that it will not (and will not support anyone else) in

the aforesaid courts. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such
court exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties for the purposes
of any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in this Agreement or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING, IN
EACH CASE, ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY DEBT PROVIDER ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE DEBT FINANCING. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

 



-67- Section 10.12. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, except that Parent and the Acquisition
Sub may assign any or all of their rights under this Agreement to any Debt
Provider (or any agent or representative thereof) in connection with the Debt
Financing as collateral security. Subject to the preceding sentence, but
without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.13. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order
of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, Parents and Acquisition Subs
obligations under _Section 7.13_ and the Companys obligations under _Section
7.14_ ).

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 10.13_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.13_ (including any objection on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). Each Party agrees
that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by
any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this
_Section 10.13_, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or
provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any such remedy.

 

Section 10.14. _No Recourse; Waiver of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company hereby irrevocably waives any
rights or claims against any Debt Provider in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the Company agrees not to commence any action or
proceeding against any Debt Provider in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and agrees to cause any such action or proceeding asserted
by the Company in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Debt Provider shall
have any liability for any claims or damages to the Company in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

it in the foregoing roles. It is agreed that DBSI will have "left side"
designation and shall appear on the top left of the cover page of any
marketing materials for any of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and will
have all rights and responsibilities customarily associated with such position
and such name placement.

 

In connection with the syndication of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, at
the Joint Lead Arrangers option, any Agent and/or one or more affiliates
thereof may also be designated as "Syndication Agent", "Documentation Agent"
or such other titles as may be deemed appropriate or desirable by the Joint
Lead Arrangers. In addition, the Joint Lead Arrangers shall have the right
(in consultation with you) to award one or more of the roles or titles
described above, or such other titles as may be determined by the Joint Lead
Arrangers, to one or more other Lenders or affiliates thereof reasonably

compensation (other than that expressly contemplated by this Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letter referred to below) will be paid in connection with
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities unless you and we shall so agree;
_provided_ that, at any time on or prior to the 15th business day following
your execution and delivery of this Commitment Letter, you may (in
consultation with the Joint Lead Arrangers) appoint up to four additional
agents, co-agents, arrangers, bookrunners, or managers reasonably acceptable
to the Joint Lead Arrangers for each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
(any such agent, co-agent, arranger, bookrunner or manager, an " _Additional
Agent_ ") and the aggregate economics payable to the Additional Agents in
respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall not exceed the sum of
(x) the TL Fee Re-Allocation Percentage (as defined below) of the total
economics in respect of the Term Loan Facility which would otherwise be
payable to the Agents party hereto on the date hereof pursuant to the Fee

Additional Agents (or their affiliates) in respect of the RCF Additional

Facility Increase Amount, and the commitments of each Additional Agent (or

Amount shall become effective, in each case upon the execution of customary
joinder documentation satisfactory to the Joint Lead Arrangers,

     | 3. | _Syndication._ 
---|---|--- 

We reserve the right, prior to and/or after the execution of

banks, financial institutions and other lenders (together with the Initial
Lenders, the " _Lenders_ ") identified by us in consultation with you pursuant
to a syndication to be managed exclusively by the Joint Lead Arrangers,
_provided_ that we will not syndicate to (i) those persons identified by you
in writing to us prior to the date hereof or (ii) bona fide competitors of the
Borrower, any of its subsidiaries or the Acquired Business that are identified
in writing by you prior to the date hereof (such persons, together with any
person that is clearly identifiable as an affiliate of such person on the
basis of its name, collectively, the " _Disqualified Institutions_ ");
_provided_ , that the Borrower, upon reasonable written notice to the Joint
Lead Arrangers after the date hereof (or, after the Closing Date, the
Administrative Agent), shall be permitted to supplement in writing the list of
persons that are Disqualified Institutions to the extent such supplemented
person is or becomes a bona fide competitor of the Borrower, any of its
subsidiaries or the Acquired Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
supplementation shall not apply retroactively to disqualify any parties
that have previously acquired an assignment or participation interest in the
Loans; and _provided_ , _further_ , that a competitor or an affiliate of a
competitor shall not include any bona fide debt fund or investment vehicle
(other than a person which is excluded pursuant to _clause (i)_ above). All
aspects of the syndication of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including,
without limitation, timing, potential syndicate members to be approached,
titles, allocations and division of fees, shall be determined by (and
coordinated through) the Joint Lead Arrangers in consultation with you.

We intend to commence our syndication efforts with respect to the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities following your execution and delivery to us of this
Commitment Letter and, until the earlier to occur of (i) a Successful
Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter) and (ii) 60 days after the Closing
Date (such period, the " _Syndication Period_ "), you agree actively to assist
(and to use your commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired
Business to actively assist) us in completing a syndication that is
reasonably satisfactory to us. Such assistance shall include (a) your using
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any syndication efforts benefit
from

 



-82-  your existing lending and investment banking relationships, (b) direct
contact between your senior management, representatives and advisors (and, to
the extent not in contravention of the Acquisition Agreement, your using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause direct contact between senior
management, representatives and advisors of the Acquired Business) on the one
hand and the proposed Lenders and rating agencies identified by the Joint
Lead Arrangers on the other hand, at times and places reasonably requested by
the Joint Lead Arrangers, (c) assistance by you (and, to the extent not in
contravention of the Acquisition Agreement, your using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the assistance by the Acquired Business) in the
prompt preparation of a Confidential Information Memorandum for the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and other marketing materials and information
reasonably deemed necessary by the Joint Lead Arrangers to complete a
Successful Syndication (collectively, the " _Information Materials_ ") for
delivery to potential syndicate members and participants prior to the
commencement of the Marketing Period, including, without limitation,
estimates, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking financial
information regarding the future performance of the Borrower and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Projections_ "), (d) the hosting, with
the Joint Lead Arrangers, of one or more meetings and/or conference calls
with prospective Lenders at such times and places as the Joint Lead Arrangers
may reasonably request, (e) your ensuring (or, in the case of the Acquired
Business, to the extent not in contravention of the Acquisition Agreement,
your using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure) that there will not be
any announcement, offering, placement or arrangement of issues of debt
securities or credit facilities of, or on behalf of, you, your subsidiaries
or the Acquired Business (including refinancings and renewals of debt but
excluding the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, incurrences of revolving loans
and other extensions of credit under the Existing Credit Agreement, debt
expressly permitted to be incurred by the Acquired Business under the
Acquisition Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof) and other indebtedness
that has otherwise been consented to by the Joint Lead Arrangers), without
the consent of the Joint Lead Arrangers, if such announcement, offering,
placement or arrangement would reasonably be expected to impair the primary
syndication of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and (g) your using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) public ratings for the Term
Loan Facility (of any level), from each of Standard and Poors Ratings Services
(" _S andP_") and Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (" _Moody s_"), and (ii) a
public corporate rating and a public corporate family rating of the Borrower
(of any level) from SandP and Moodys, respectively, in each case prior to the
launch of the primary syndication of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Commitment Letter
or the Fee Letter, (i) none of the foregoing (including the obtaining of the
ratings referenced above) shall constitute a condition to the commitments
hereunder or the funding of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the
Closing Date and (ii) except as expressly provided in paragraph 8 of the
Summary of Additional Conditions, neither the commencement nor the completion
of the syndication of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall constitute a
condition precedent to the Closing Date.

You hereby acknowledge that (a) the Agents will make available Information
(as defined below) and Projections, and the documentation relating to the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities referred to in the paragraph below, to the
proposed syndicate of Lenders (which will exclude Disqualified Institutions)
by transmitting such Information, Projections and documentation through
Intralinks, Debtdomain, SyndTrak Online, the internet, email or similar
electronic transmission systems and (b) certain of the Lenders may be "public
side" Lenders ( _i.e._ , Lenders

 



-83-  that (i) have personnel that wish only to receive information and
documentation that is publicly available and (ii) do not wish to receive
material non-public information with respect to the Borrower and its
subsidiaries, the Acquired Business or their respective securities). You
further agree, at the request of the Joint Lead Arrangers, to assist in the
prompt preparation of a version of the Confidential Information
Memorandum and other marketing materials and presentations to be used in
connection with the syndication of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
consisting exclusively of information and documentation that is either (i)
publicly available and (ii) not material with respect to the Borrower, the
Acquired Business or their respective subsidiaries or any of their respective
securities for purposes of foreign, United States Federal and state securities
laws (all such information and documentation being " _Public Lender
Information_ " and with any information and documentation that is not Public
Lender Information being referred to herein as " _Private Lender Information_
").

 

It is understood that in connection with your assistance described above,
customary authorization letters will be included in any such Confidential
Information Memorandum that authorize the distribution thereof to prospective
Lenders, represent that the additional version of the Confidential Information
Memorandum does not include any material non-public information and

---|---|--- 

You represent and warrant (and with respect to Information (as defined below)
relating to the Acquired Business, to the best of your knowledge prior to the
Closing Date) that (a)(i) no written information which has been or is
hereafter furnished by you or on your behalf in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than the Projections, other forward-
looking information and information of a general economic or industry specific
nature) and (ii) no other information given at information meetings for
potential syndicate members and supplied or approved by you or on your behalf
(other than the Projections, other forward-looking information and information
of a general economic or industry specific nature) (such written

 



-84-  information and other information being referred to herein collectively as
the " _Information_ ") taken as a whole contained (or, in the case of
Information furnished after the date hereof, will contain), as of the time it
was (or hereafter is) furnished, any material misstatement of fact or omitted
(or will omit) as of such time to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein taken as a whole not misleading, in light of the
circumstances under which they were (or hereafter are) made and (b) the
Projections that have been or will be made available to the Joint Lead
Arrangers by you or any of your representatives have been or will be prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions that the preparer believes to be
reasonable at the time made and at the time such Projections are made
available to the Joint Lead Arrangers, it being recognized by the Agents that
such Projections are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during
the period or periods covered by any such Projections may differ significantly
from the projected results, and that no assurance can be given that the
projected results will be realized. You agree that if at any time prior to
the later of (x) the Closing Date and (y) the expiration of the Syndication
Period, any of the representations and warranties in the preceding sentence
would (to the best of your knowledge, with respect to Information relating to
the Acquired Business prior to the Closing Date) be incorrect in any material
respect if the Information and Projections were being furnished, and such
representations and warranties were being made, at such time, then you will
promptly supplement the Information and the Projections so that (to the best
of your knowledge, with respect to the Information relating to the Acquired
Business prior to the Closing Date) such representations and warranties will
be correct in all material respects under those circumstances. You understand
that, in arranging and syndicating the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we
will be entitled to use and rely on the Information and the Projections
without responsibility for independent verification thereof and do not assume
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the Information or the
Projections.

as a result of a breach of such representations (the " _Acquisition Agreement
Representations_ ") and (y) the Specified Representations (as defined below)
and (ii) the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Documentation shall be in a

the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright
Office, if the perfection of the Administrative Agents security interest in
such Collateral may not be accomplished prior to the Closing Date after your

security interest in such Collateral shall not constitute a condition
precedent to the availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on
the Closing Date but, instead, may be accomplished within 60 days after the
Closing Date (or such longer period after the Closing Date reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent) and (II) nothing in preceding _clause

the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Credit
Documentation (including in 

 



-86-  connection with our due diligence and syndication efforts) and (ii) all

affiliates arising in connection with the enforcement of this Commitment
Letter, the Fee Letter, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior

and its affiliates for all such fees and expenses paid or incurred by them),
whether or not the Transaction is consummated; _provided_ that you shall only
be responsible for the fees and expenses of one primary counsel acting for the
Agents (taken as a whole) for each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
one regulatory counsel in each applicable specialty and one local or
foreign counsel for each relevant jurisdiction as may be necessary or
advisable in the judgment of the Agents; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
case of _clause (i)_ , such costs and expenses shall not exceed $250,000 (the
" _Expense Cap_ ") if the Closing Date does not occur, unless otherwise
agreed by you. The Agents shall use good faith efforts to notify you when fees
and expenses of the type referred to in _clause (i)_ of the preceding
sentence equal $200,000 and, thereafter, use good faith efforts to notify you
of each additional $100,000 in such fees and expenses (it being understood,
however, that any failure to provide such notice shall not limit your
reimbursement obligations hereunder). 

You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, each Additional
Agent and each other agent or co-agent (if any) designated by the Joint Lead
Arrangers with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (each, a " _Co-
Agent_ ") and their respective affiliates and controlling persons and the

agents of each of the foregoing (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") from and
against any and all actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations
or inquiries), claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind
or nature whatsoever which may be incurred by or asserted against or involve
any Agent, any Co-Agent or any other such Indemnified Person as a result of or
arising out of or in any way related to or resulting from the Transaction,
this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter and, upon demand, to pay and
reimburse each Agent, each Co-Agent and each other Indemnified Person for any
reasonable and documented legal or other out-of-pocket expenses paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend
any such action, suit, proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) or
claim (whether or not any Agent, any Co-Agent or any other such Indemnified
Person is a party to any action or proceeding out of which any such expenses
arise or such matter is initiated by a third party or by you or any of your
affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that you shall not have to indemnify any
Indemnified Person against any loss, claim, damage, expense or liability to
the extent same resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith of such Indemnified Person (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment); and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that you shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of only
one counsel for all Indemnified Persons in connection with indemnification
claims arising out of the same facts or circumstances and, if reasonably
necessary or advisable in the judgment of the Agents, a single regulatory
counsel in each applicable specialty and a single local or foreign counsel to
the Indemnified Persons in each relevant jurisdiction and, solely in the case
of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, one additional regulatory
counsel in each applicable specialty and one local or foreign counsel in each
applicable jurisdiction to the affected Indemnified Persons. No Indemnified
Person shall be responsible or liable to you or any other person or entity

jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment) or (y) any indirect,
special, exemplary, incidental, punitive or consequential damages (including,
without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings)
which may be alleged as a result of this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or
the financing contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this paragraph shall not affect the Expense Cap as it may apply to fees
and expenses expressly covered by _clause (i)_ of the preceding paragraph.



     | 8. | _Sharing Information; Absence of Fiduciary Relationship;
Affiliate Activities._ 
---|---|--- 

Each Agent reserves the right to employ the services of its affiliates
(including, in the case of DB, Deutsche Bank AG) in providing services
contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and to allocate, in
whole or in part, to its affiliates certain fees payable to such Agent in
such manner as such Agent and its affiliates may agree in their sole
discretion. You acknowledge that (i) each Agent may share with any of its
affiliates, and such affiliates may share with such Agent, any information
related to the Transaction, you, the Acquired Business (and your and their
respective subsidiaries and affiliates), or any of the matters contemplated
hereby and (ii) each Agent and its affiliates may be providing
debt financing, equity capital or other services (including financial
advisory services) to other companies in respect of which you or your
subsidiaries may have conflicting interests regarding the transactions
described herein or otherwise. No Agent will, however, furnish confidential
information obtained from you by virtue of the transactions contemplated by
this Commitment Letter or its other relationships with you to other companies
(other than your affiliates). You also acknowledge that no Agent has any
obligation to use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Commitment Letter, or to furnish to you, confidential information obtained by
it from other companies.

 

You further acknowledge and agree that (a) no fiduciary, advisory or agency
relationship between you and us is intended to be or has been created in
respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter,
irrespective of whether we or our affiliates have advised or are advising you
on other matters, (b) we, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, have
an arms-length business relationship that does not directly or indirectly
give rise to, nor do you rely on, any fiduciary duty on our part, (c) you are
capable of evaluating and understanding, and you understand and accept, the
terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this
Commitment Letter, (d) you have been advised that we and our affiliates are
engaged in a broad range of transactions that may involve interests that
differ from your interests and that we and our affiliates have no obligation
to disclose such interests and transactions to you by virtue of any fiduciary,
advisory or agency relationship, and (e) you waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any claims you may have against us or our affiliates for
breach of fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agree that we
and our affiliates shall have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to you
in respect of such a fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting
a fiduciary duty claim on behalf of or in right of you, including your
stockholders, employees or creditors.

You further acknowledge that each of DBSI and MLPFS is a full service
securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well
as providing investment banking and other financial services. In the ordinary
course of business, DBSI, MLPFS and/or their 

 



-88-  respective affiliates may provide investment banking and other financial
services to, and/or acquire, hold or sell, for their own accounts and the
accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial
instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of, you, the Acquired
Business and your and its respective subsidiaries and other companies with
which you, your subsidiaries or the Acquired Business may have commercial or
other relationships. With respect to any securities and/or financial
instruments so held by DBSI, MLPFS, any of their respective affiliates or any
of their respective customers, all rights in respect of such securities and
financial instruments, including any voting rights, will be exercised by the
holder of the rights, in its sole discretion.

Each Agent or its affiliates may also co-invest with, make direct investments
in, and invest or co-invest client monies in or with funds or other investment
vehicles managed by other parties, and such funds or other investment vehicles
may trade or make investments in securities of you, your subsidiaries, the
Acquired Business or other companies which may be the subject of the
arrangements contemplated by this Commitment Letter or engage in commodities
trading with any thereof.

 

You acknowledge that you have been advised of the roles of DB and MLPFS and/or
their respective affiliates as buy-side advisors to you in connection with
the Transaction and that, in such capacity, DB and MLPFS and/or their
respective affiliates are not advising you to enter into this Commitment
Letter or advising you with respect to any financing contemplated herein. You
acknowledge and agree that you (together with your legal and other advisors)
are independently evaluating this Commitment Letter and any provision of
financing contemplated herein and are fully aware of any conflicts of interest
which may exist as a result of DBs and MLPFS engagement hereunder and the
engagement of DB and MLPFS and/or their respective affiliates as buy-side
advisors to you. You acknowledge and agree to such retentions, and further
agree not to assert any claim you might allege based on any actual or
potential conflicts of interest that might be asserted to arise or result
from, on the one hand, the engagement of DB and MLPFS hereunder or any
arrangement, underwriting or provision by DB and MLPFS and/or
their respective affiliates of any financing in connection with the
Transactions and, on the other hand, DBs and MLPFS and/or their respective
affiliates roles as buy-side advisors to you in connection with the
Transactions. Each of DB and MLPFS acknowledges (i) the role of MLPFS and/or
its affiliates as a buy-side advisor to you in connection with the Transaction
and (ii) that such relationship does not create any fiduciary duty or
responsibilities to the other Agents on the part of either DB or MLPFS and/or
their respective affiliates.

This Commitment Letter is delivered to you on the understanding that neither

Letter and shall treat confidentially all such information; _provided_ that
nothing herein shall prevent any Agent from disclosing any such

or in any pending legal or administrative proceeding, or otherwise as required
by applicable law or compulsory legal process (in which case such Agent, to
the extent permitted by law, agrees to inform you promptly thereof), (b) upon

by the terms of this paragraph (or language substantially similar to this
paragraph), (h) for purposes of establishing a "due diligence" defense, (i) to
enforce their respective rights hereunder or under the Fee Letter, or (j) to

exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect to its
commitments in respect of the applicable Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
including all rights with respect to consents, modifications, supplements and
amendments, until the Closing Date has occurred. Any and all obligations of,
and services to be provided by, any Agent hereunder (including, without
limitation, the commitment of any Initial Lender) may be performed, and any
and all rights of any Agent hereunder may be exercised, by or through any of
its affiliates or branches; _provided_ that with respect to the commitments
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, any assignments thereof to an

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this _Exhibit A_ shall have the
meanings set forth in the commitment letter to which this  _Exhibit A_ is
attached (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") and in the other exhibits to the
Commitment Letter.

ON Semiconductor Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _you_ " or the "
_Borrower_ ") intends to (i) acquire in a "friendly" transaction, through a
newly-formed U.S. subsidiary wholly-owned by the Borrower (the " _MergerCo_
"), 100% of the capital stock of the company identified to us and code-named
"Falcon", a Delaware corporation (the " _Target_ " and, together with its
subsidiaries, the " _Acquired Business_ "), by way of (x) a cash tender offer
(the " _Tender Offer_ ") for any and all of the outstanding capital stock of
the Target, subject to the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement as in effect on the date hereof), and (y) a merger on the Closing
Date of MergerCo with and into the Target pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _Merger_ "), in each case in
accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger (together with all exhibits,
schedules, and disclosure letters thereto, collectively, the " _Acquisition
Agreement_ "), dated as of November 18, 2015, by the Borrower, MergerCo and
the Target and all applicable law, with the Target as the surviving entity of
the Merger, to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Borrower (collectively, the
" _Acquisition_ "), and (ii) concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition, repay all of the existing indebtedness of the Borrower, its
subsidiaries and the Acquired Business other than Permitted Surviving
Indebtedness (the " _Refinancing_ "). After the consummation of the
Acquisition, all of the outstanding equity interests of the Target will be
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Borrower.

The sources of funds needed to effect the Acquisition and the Refinancing, to
pay all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (the "
_Transaction Costs_ ") and to provide for the working capital needs and
general corporate requirements of the Borrower and its subsidiaries after
giving effect to the Acquisition shall be provided solely through:

(i) a senior secured financing consisting of (I) a $2,400.0 million "B" term
loan facility (the " _Term Loan Facility_ ") and (II) a $300.0 million
revolving credit facility (the " _Initial Revolving Credit Facility_ ");
_provided_ that the Initial Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an
aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 million (the " _Revolving Credit
Facility Increase Amount_ ") by way of additional commitments provided by
Additional Agents (or affiliates thereof) pursuant to, and on the terms and
conditions of, the Commitment Letter (the Initial Revolving Credit Facility as
increased by the Revolving Credit Facility Increase Amount, the " _Revolving
Credit Facility_ " and, together with the Term Loan Facility, collectively,
the " _Senior Secured Credit Facilities_ " and with any commitments with
respect to the Revolving Credit Facility (whether pursuant to the Initial
Revolving Credit Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility Increase Amount)
provided by Additional Agents (or affiliates thereof), " _RCF Additional
Commitments_ "); and

 

(ii) unrestricted cash on hand of the Borrower and the Target.

 



A-1 The date on which the Acquisition and the Refinancing are consummated and the
initial borrowings are made under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ".

The transactions described above are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Transaction_ ".

   |  |  |  |

1.

 |  | _Amount_ : Revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal

    |  |  |  | 3. |  | _Maturity_ : The final maturity date of

   |  |  | 
   |  |  |  | 5. |  | _Letters of Credit_ : Up to $15.0 million of
the Revolving Credit Facility will be available for the issuance on a serial
basis of stand-by letters of credit (" _Letters of Credit_ ") by each of DBNY
and Bank of America (each a " _Primary Issuing Lender_ ") and/or one or more
of the other Lenders agreeing to act in such capacity to support obligations
of the Borrower and its subsidiaries; _provided_ that each Primary Issuing
Lenders obligation to issue Letters of Credit shall be subject to an
independent sub-limit of $7.5 million. Maturities for Letters of Credit will
not exceed twelve months, renewable annually thereafter and, in any event,
shall not extend beyond the fifth business day prior to the Revolving Loan
Maturity Date. Letter of Credit outstandings will reduce availability under
the Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Each Lender under

_pro_ _rata_ participation in all Letter of Credit outstandings. 
   |  |  | 
   |  |  |  | 6. |  | _Swingline Loans_ : Up to an amount to be

B-3 ---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |  |  |  | Dollar-based tranche and a multicurrency
tranche providing for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit denominated in
certain additional currencies, with multicurrency mechanics substantially
consistent with the Existing Credit Agreement and otherwise reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (including a so-called "collateral
allocation mechanism") and with tranche sizes and multicurrency sub-limits to
be mutually agreed. 
   | 
   _Incremental Facilities_ : |  | The Borrower will have the right to
obtain from existing Lenders or prospective lenders incremental commitments
consisting of one or more (x) increases to the Revolving Credit Facility
(each, an " _Incremental Revolving Facility_ ") and/or (y) increases to the
Term Loan Facility and/or one or more new tranches of term loans to be made
available under the Senior Secured Credit Documentation (each, an "
_Incremental Term Facility_ " and, together with the Incremental Revolving
Facilities, the " _Incremental Facilities_ ") in an aggregate amount not to
exceed an amount equal to the greater of (a) $500.0 million and (b) an amount
at such time that, after giving _pro_   _forma_ effect thereto (including use
of proceeds), could be incurred without causing the _pro_ _forma_ First Lien
Net Leverage Ratio (as defined below) to exceed the _pro_ _forma_ First Lien
Net Leverage Ratio on the Closing Date; _provided_ that (i) all Incremental
Facilities and permitted refinancings of the foregoing (or prior permitted
refinancings) shall be included in the numerator of such ratio regardless of
whether, and to what extent, secured, (ii) the proceeds of any Incremental
Facilities shall not be netted from indebtedness for the purposes of such
calculation and (iii) all Incremental Revolving Facilities shall be deemed to
be fully drawn for purposes of such calculation; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that: 
   |  | 
   |  | (i) |  | no such Incremental Facility will be available until
after the later to occur of the Closing Date and the date on which a
Successful Syndication has occurred; 
   |  | 
   |  | (ii) |  | (A) no default or event of default exists or would
exist after giving effect thereto and (B) the representations and warranties
set forth in the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Documentation shall be
true and correct in all material respects (except for (x) representations and
warranties which expressly relate to an earlier date, which shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date and (y)
representations and warranties qualified by materiality, which shall be true
and correct in all respects); _provided_ that to the extent the proceeds of
any Incremental Facility are intended to be applied to finance a Limited
Conditionality Acquisition (as defined below) that is permitted under the
Senior Secured Credit Documentation, the availability thereof shall, if agreed
by the lenders providing such 
  



B-4 ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |  | Incremental Facility, be subject to customary
"SunGard" or "certain funds" conditionality provisions, and the event of
default test referred to in immediately preceding _clause (A)_ shall
be tested at the time of the execution of the relevant acquisition agreement; 
   |  | 
   |  | (iii) |  | any such Incremental Facility shall rank pari passu
in right of payment with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and shall
benefit from the same guarantees as, and be secured on a pari passu basis by
the same Collateral (as defined below) securing, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities; 
   |  | 
   |  | (iv) |  | in the case of an Incremental Revolving Facility,
such Incremental Revolving Facility shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Revolving Credit Facility (and be deemed added to, and made
a part of, the Revolving Credit Facility); and 
   |  | 
   |  | (v) |  | except for the terms described in this clause (v),
loans to be made under an Incremental Term Facility (each, an " _Incremental
Term Loan_ ") shall be subject to the same terms as the Term Loans, unless
such Incremental Term Loans are made a part of the Term Loan Facility (in
which case all terms thereof shall be identical to those of the Term Loan
Facility), _provided_ that 
   |  |  |  | 
   |  |  |  |  |  | (a) |  | if the interest rate margins for
any Incremental Term Facility incurred prior to the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date are higher than the interest rate margins for
the Term Loan Facility by more than 50 basis points, then the interest rate
margins for the Term Loan Facility shall be increased to the extent necessary
so that such interest rate margins are equal to the interest rate margins for
such Incremental Term Facility minus 50 basis points (it being understood
that any such increase in the interest rate margin shall not require the
consent of any Lender); _provided_ that, in determining the interest rate
margins applicable to the Incremental Term Facility and the Term Loan Facility
(x) original issue discount (" _OID_ ") or upfront fees (which shall be
deemed to constitute like amounts of OID) payable by Borrower to the Lenders
under the Term Loan Facility or any Incremental Term Facility in the initial
primary syndication thereof shall be included (with OID being equated to
interest based on assumed four-year life to maturity), (y) customary
arrangement, commitment or similar fees payable to the Joint Lead Arrangers
(or their affiliates) in connection with the Term Loan Facility or to 
  



B-5 ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | one or more arrangers (or their
affiliates) of any Incremental Term Facility shall be excluded and (z) if the
Incremental Term Facilities include an interest rate floor greater than the
interest rate floor applicable to the existing Term Loan Facility, such
increased amount shall be equated to interest margin for purposes of
determining whether an increase to the applicable interest margin under the
existing Term Loan Facility shall be required, to the extent an increase in
the interest rate floor in the then-existing Term Loan Facility would cause
an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such case
the interest rate floor (but not the interest rate margin) applicable to the
then-existing Term Loan Facility shall be increased by such increased amount; 
   |  |  |  | 
   |  |  |  |  |  | (b) |  | the final stated maturity date for
such Incremental Term Loans may be the same as or later (but not sooner) than
the final stated maturity date applicable to the Term Loans; 
   |  |  |  | 
   |  |  |  |  |  | (c) |  | the amortization requirements for
such Incremental Term Loans may differ from those of the Term Loans,
_provided_ the average weighted life to maturity of such Incremental Term
Loans is no shorter than the average weighted life to maturity applicable to
the then outstanding Term Loans; 
   |  |  |  | 
   |  |  |  |  |  | (d) |  | any Incremental Term Facility may
provide for the ability to participate on a pro rata basis or less than a pro
rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or
mandatory prepayments of the term loans under other outstanding term
facilities under the Senior Secured Credit Documentation; and 
   |  |  |  | 
   |  |  |  |  |  | (e) |  | other terms may differ if
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the
lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans; _provided_ that the other terms
of any Incremental Term Facility that are not substantially identical to the
then-existing Term Loan Facility (other than pursuant to _clauses (i)_
through _(iii)_ above and _sub-clauses (a)_ through _(d)_ above) shall be
(taken as a whole) no more favorable (as reasonably determined by the
Borrower) to the relevant lenders under the Incremental Term Facility than
those applicable to the then-existing Term Loan Facility or otherwise
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (except for covenants
or other provisions applicable only to periods after the latest final
maturity date of the loans under the then-existing Term Loan Facility existing
at the time of incurrence of the Incremental Term Facility). 
  



B-6 ---|---|--- 
     |  | For the purposes hereof, (x) " _First Lien Net Leverage
Ratio_ " means, on any date of determination, with respect to the Borrower and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, subject to the proviso in
_clause (i)_ of the first paragraph of this section, the ratio of (a)
consolidated secured indebtedness (excluding indebtedness secured only by the
Collateral on a junior lien basis to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and
which is subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on such date
(less the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Borrower and its
subsidiaries as of such date) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (to be defined as
mutually agreed) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries for the four fiscal
quarter period most recently ended for which financial statements have been
(or were required to have been) delivered and (y) " _Total Net Leverage
Ratio_ " means, on any date of determination, with respect to the Borrower and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the ratio of (a) consolidated
indebtedness of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on such date (less the
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Borrower and its subsidiaries as
of such date) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its subsidiaries
for the four fiscal quarter period most recently ended for which
financial statements have been (or were required to have been) delivered. 
   | 
   |  | Existing Lenders may, but shall not be obligated without their
prior written consent to, provide a commitment and/or make any loans pursuant
to any Incremental Facility, and nothing contained herein or in the Commitment
Letter constitutes, or shall be deemed to constitute, a commitment with
respect to any Incremental Facility. The lenders providing any Incremental
Facility shall be reasonably satisfactory to (a) the Administrative Agent and
each Primary Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender to the extent required under
"Assignments and Participations" below and (b) the Borrower. 
   | 
   |  | The proceeds of any Incremental Facilities may be used by the
Borrower and its subsidiaries for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, including the financing of permitted acquisitions and other
investments and any other use not prohibited by the Senior Secured Credit
Documentation. 
   | 
   |  | For the purposes of determining _pro_ _forma_ compliance with the
First Lien Net Leverage Ratio in connection with any Incremental Facilities,
the proceeds of which are to be used for a permitted acquisition that
the Borrower or its subsidiaries is contractually committed to consummate and
whose consummation is not conditioned on the availability of third party
financing (a " _Limited Conditionality Acquisition_ "), the date of 
 



B-7 ---|---|--- 
    |  | determination thereof shall, at the Borrowers option, be the
date of entering into the binding definitive agreement for such acquisition
and shall be made giving _pro_ _forma_ effect to such acquisition and the
other transactions (including the incurrence of indebtedness) to be entered
into in connection therewith as if they had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable test period; _provided_ that (x) such indebtedness (and any
associated lien) shall be deemed incurred at the time of such selection and
outstanding thereafter for the purposes of _pro_ _forma_ compliance with any
applicable ratios and (y) for purposes of any calculation of any ratio with
respect to the incurrence of any other debt or liens, or the making of any
other acquisition, investment, restricted payment, junior debt repayment or
other transaction subject to ratio compliance on or following such date and
prior to the consummation of such Limited Conditionality Acquisition (or
termination of the definitive agreement with respect thereto), any such ratio
shall also be required to be calculated without giving effect to such Limited
Conditionality Acquisition. 
   | 
   _Guaranties_ : |  | Each direct and indirect material subsidiary and
each "Qualifying Subsidiary" (as defined below) of the Borrower (each, a "
_Guarantor_ " and, collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ") shall be required to
provide an unconditional guaranty (collectively, the " _Guaranties_ ") of all
amounts owing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, to the extent so
designated by the Borrower as "Secured Hedging Agreements", the obligations
of the Borrower under interest rate and/or foreign currency swaps or similar
agreements with a Lender or its affiliates or the Administrative Agent or its
affiliates (the " _Secured Hedging Agreements_ "). Such Guaranties shall be
guarantees of payment and not of collection. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained above (i) no "unrestricted subsidiary" (designated as
provided below under the heading "Unrestricted Subsidiaries") or Excluded
Foreign Subsidiary (as defined below) shall be required to provide a Guaranty
(or constitute a Guarantor) and (ii) no subsidiary of the Borrower that is not
an "Eligible Contract Participant" (after giving effect to any keepwell) as
defined under the Commodity Exchange Act shall be required to provide a
Guaranty (or constitute a Guarantor) with respect to (and solely with respect
to) obligations under any Secured Hedging Agreement that constitutes a "swap"
within the meaning of section 1(a)(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
   | 
   |  | As used herein, (I) " _Excluded Foreign Subsidiary_ " means (a)
any direct or indirect non-U.S. subsidiary of the Borrower which is a
"controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957 of
the Internal Revenue Code) (each, a " _CFC_ "), (b) any direct or indirect
U.S. subsidiary of the Borrower that is treated as a "disregarded entity" for
federal income tax purposes the sole assets of which are equity interests
in CFCs (each, a " _Pass-Through Foreign Holdco_ ") or other Pass-Through 
 



B-8 ---|---|--- 
    |  | Foreign Holdcos and (c) any direct or indirect subsidiary of a
CFC or Pass-Through Foreign Holdco and (II) " _Qualifying Subsidiary_ " means
any restricted subsidiary that has guaranteed permitted convertible
notes, permitted senior unsecured notes and permitted unsecured indebtedness. 
   | 
   _Security_ : |  | All amounts owing under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and (if applicable) the Secured Hedging Agreements (and all
obligations under the Guaranties) will be secured by (x) a first-priority
perfected security interest in all stock, other equity interests and
promissory notes owned by the Borrower and the Guarantors; _provided_ that not
more than 65% of the total outstanding voting stock of any Excluded Foreign
Subsidiary shall be required to be pledged, and (y) a first-priority
perfected security interest in all other tangible and intangible assets
(including, without limitation, receivables, inventory, equipment, contract
rights, securities, patents, trademarks, other intellectual property, cash,
bank and securities deposit accounts, real estate and leasehold interests)
owned by the Borrower and the Guarantors (all of the foregoing, the "
_Collateral_ "), in each case as may be subject to liens permitted by the
Senior Secured Credit Documentation (including liens on assets of the
Acquired Business permitted to remain outstanding after the Closing Date under
the Acquisition Agreement). 
   | 
   |  | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Collateral shall
exclude the following: (i) any fee owned real property with a value of less
than an amount to be mutually agreed (with any required mortgages on
properties with a value greater than such amount being permitted to be
delivered post-closing) and immaterial leaseholds; (ii) equity interests of
non-wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, to the extent prohibited
under the organizational documents of such non-wholly owned subsidiaries or
joint ventures; (iii) licenses, instruments and agreements (including any
governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and
authorizations) to the extent, and so long as, the pledge thereof
as Collateral would violate the terms thereof, but only, to the extent, and
for so long as, such prohibition is not terminated or rendered unenforceable
or otherwise deemed ineffective by the Uniform Commercial Code (" _UCC_ "),
Title 11 of the United States Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ ") or any other
requirement of law and other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the
assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the UCC or other

vehicles and other assets subject to certificate of title to the extent that a
security interest therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a UCC-1
financing statement, (v) other assets to the extent the pledge thereof is

prohibition is not terminated or rendered unenforceable or otherwise deemed
ineffective by the UCC, Bankruptcy Code or any other

    |  | requirement of law and other than proceeds and receivables
thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the UCC
or other applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition or limitation; (vi)

to which the Administrative Agent shall determine that the costs of obtaining
such security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the
value of the security to be afforded thereby; (viii) any payroll accounts,
employee wage and benefit accounts, tax accounts, escrow accounts, or
fiduciary or trust accounts; (ix) any voting equity interests of a CFC or a
Pass-Through Foreign Holdco in excess of 65% of the total outstanding voting

such assets would result in material adverse tax consequences to the Borrower
or any Guarantor (including, without limitation, as a result of the operation
of Section 956 of the IRS Code or any similar law or regulation in any
applicable jurisdiction) as reasonably determined by the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent in good faith. 
   | 
   |  | All documentation (collectively referred to herein as the "
_Security Agreements_ ") evidencing the security required pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and shall effectively
create first-priority security interests in the property purported to be
covered thereby, with such exceptions as are acceptable to the Administrative
Agent in its reasonable discretion. 
   | 
   |  | Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of the preceding
paragraphs of this "Security" section shall be, as of the Closing Date,
subject to the Funds Certain Provisions. 
   | 
  

_Optional Commitment Reductions_ :

 |  | The unutilized portion of the total commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility may, upon three business days notice, be reduced or
terminated by the Borrower without penalty in minimum amounts to be
mutually agreed. 
   | 
  

_Voluntary Prepayments_ :

 |  | Voluntary prepayments may be made at any time on three business days
notice in the case of LIBOR Loans, or one business days notice in the case of
Base Rate Loans (or same day notice in the case of Swingline Loans), without
premium or penalty (subject, however, to the Prepayment Premium referred to
below), in minimum principal amounts to be mutually agreed; _provided_ that
voluntary prepayments of LIBOR Loans made on a date other than the last day of
an interest period applicable thereto shall be subject to customary breakage
costs. Voluntary prepayments of Term Loans shall apply to reduce future
scheduled amortization payments of the Term Loans in direct order of maturity. 
  



B-10 ---|---|--- 
     _Mandatory Repayments and Commitment Reductions_ : |  | Mandatory
repayments of Term Loans shall be required from (a) 100% of the proceeds (net
of taxes and costs and expenses in connection with the sale) from asset sales
by the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including sales or issuances of equity
interests of any subsidiary of the Borrower) in excess of an amount to be
agreed but subject to certain ordinary course exceptions and reinvestment
rights to be mutually agreed, (b) 100% of the net proceeds from issuances or
incurrences of debt (including any Refinancing Facilities (as defined below)
but with appropriate exceptions to be mutually agreed) by the Borrower and its
subsidiaries, (c) commencing with the first full fiscal year of the Borrower
to occur after the Closing Date, 50% (reducing, so long as no default or
event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is in existence,
to 25% and 0% based on meeting specified leverage tests to be mutually agreed)
of annual Excess Cash Flow (to be defined to the satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent and to include, in any event, deductions for certain
investments and capital expenditures financed with internally generated cash)
of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, with any such required repayment amount
to be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of voluntary prepayments of
Loans made with internally generated funds during the applicable year
(excluding Swingline Loans but including Revolving Loans, solely to the extent
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are permanently reduced by
the amount of such repayments) and (d) 100% of the net proceeds from insurance
recovery and condemnation events of the Borrower and its subsidiaries (subject
to certain reinvestment rights and a materiality threshold to be mutually
agreed). 
   | 
   |  | All mandatory repayments of Term Loans made pursuant to _clauses
(a)_ through _(d)_ , inclusive, above shall (subject to the immediately
succeeding paragraph) apply to reduce future scheduled amortization payments
of the Term Loans in direct order of maturity. If the amount of any mandatory
repayment which would otherwise be required as provided above exceeds the
aggregate principal amount of Term Loans then outstanding, such excess shall
be applied to repay Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans. In addition, (i) if
at any time the outstandings pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility
(including Letter of Credit outstandings and Swingline Loans) exceed the
aggregate commitments with respect thereto, prepayments of Revolving Loans
and/or Swingline Loans (and/or the cash collateralization of Letters of
Credit) shall be required in an amount equal to such excess and (ii) after
giving effect to the consummation of the Transaction on the Closing Date, all
commitments under the Term Loan Facility (if any) not required to finance the
Transaction shall be terminated in their entirety. 
   | 
   |  | Any Lender (each, a " _Declining Lender_ ") may elect not to
accept any mandatory prepayment pursuant to _clause (a)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_
above. Any prepayment amount declined by a Declining Lender (such declined 
 



B-11 ---|---|--- 
    |  | payment, the " _Declined Proceeds_ ") shall first be applied to
the prepayment of Term Loans owed to non-Declining Lenders, with any remaining
amount of Declined Proceeds after such application to be retained by
the Borrower. 
   | 
   _Prepayment Premium_ : |  | The occurrence of any Repricing Event (as
defined below) with respect to Term Loans, in each case prior to the six-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, will require payment of a fee (the "
_Prepayment Premium_ ") of an amount equal to 1% of the principal amount of
the Term Loans subject to such Repricing Event. 
   | 
   |  | As used herein, the term " _Repricing Event_ " shall mean, other
than in connection with any transaction involving a Change of Control or a
Transformative Acquisition (each, to be defined), (i) any prepayment
or repayment of Term Loans with the proceeds of, or any conversion of Term
Loans into, any new or replacement indebtedness bearing interest with an
"effective yield" (taking into account, for example, upfront fees, interest
rate spreads, interest rate benchmark floors and original issue discount)
less than the "effective yield" applicable to the Term Loans subject to such
event (as such comparative yields are determined by the Administrative Agent)
and (ii) any amendment to Senior Secured Credit Documentation which reduces
the "effective yield" applicable to the Term Loans (it being understood that
any prepayment premium with respect to a Repricing Event shall apply to any
required assignment by a non-consenting Lender in connection with any such
amendment pursuant to so-called yank-a-bank provisions). 
   | 
   _Senior Secured Credit Documentation_ : |  | The definitive financing
documentation for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the " _Senior Secured
Credit Documentation_ ") shall be based on that certain Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, dated as of October 10, 2013, among Semiconductor
Components Industries, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the
borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time
party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and
collateral agent (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified through the date hereof, the " _Existing Credit Agreement_
"), and shall contain the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter and such other terms as the Borrower and the Joint Lead Arrangers shall
agree; it being understood and agreed that the Senior Secured Credit
Documentation shall: (a) not contain any conditions as to the availability and
initial funding of the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility
on the Closing Date other than the applicable conditions set forth under the
heading "Conditions Precedent" below and in _Exhibit C_ to the Commitment
Letter, in each case, subject to the Certain Funds Provisions; (b) be subject
to the modifications expressly contemplated by the "Market Flex" provisions in
the Fee Letter; (c) contain only those mandatory prepayments, 
 



B-12 ---|---|--- 
    |  | representations and warranties, affirmative, financial and
negative covenants and events of default expressly set forth in this Term
Sheet, in each case, applicable to the Borrower and its restricted
subsidiaries and subject to standards, qualifications, thresholds, exceptions
for materiality or otherwise and "baskets," grace and cure periods as may be
mutually agreed between the Borrower and the Joint Lead Arrangers; (d) give
due regard to the customary operational and administrative agency provisions
of the Administrative Agent; (e) be negotiated in good faith by the Borrower
and the Agents so that the Senior Secured Credit Documentation, giving effect
to the Certain Funds Provisions, is finalized as promptly as practicable

the Borrower and the Agents. 
   | 
   _Refinancing Facilities; Refinancing Notes:_  |  | The Borrower shall
have the right to refinance and/or replace the Term Loans (and loans under any
Incremental Term Facility) or Revolving Loans and commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility (and loans and commitments under any Incremental
Revolving Facility) in whole or in part with (x) one or more new term
facilities (each, a " _Refinancing Term Facility_ ") or new revolving credit
facilities (each, a " _Refinancing Revolving Facility_ " and, together with
any Refinancing Term Facility, a " _Refinancing Facility_ " or the "
_Refinancing Facilities_ ") under the Senior Secured Credit Documentation, in
each case, with the consent of the Borrower and the institutions providing
such Refinancing Facility and/or (y) one or more series of notes or loans, in
the case of each of _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ , that will be pari passu or
junior in right of payment and be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu
or junior basis with the remaining portion of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities or be unsecured (such notes or loans, the " _Refinancing Notes_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) any Refinancing Facility or issue of Refinancing Notes
that is pari passu or junior with respect to the security shall be subject to
a customary intercreditor agreement, the terms of which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, (b) no Refinancing
Term Facility or Refinancing Notes shall mature prior to the maturity date of
the applicable term loans being refinanced or replaced, and, in the case of
any term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Documentation, no Refinancing
Term Facility or Refinancing Notes shall have a shorter weighted average life
to maturity than, or, with respect to Refinancing Notes, have mandatory
prepayment provisions (other than related to customary asset sale and change
of control offers) that could result in prepayments of such Refinancing Notes
prior to, the term loans being refinanced or replaced, (c) no Refinancing
Revolving Facility shall mature (or require commitment reductions) prior to
the maturity date of the Revolving Loans or commitments being refinanced, (d)
such Refinancing Facility or Refinancing Notes shall have pricing (including
interest, fees and premiums), optional prepayment and redemption terms as may

by any assets other than the Collateral, (f) such Refinancing Facility or
Refinancing Notes shall not be guaranteed by any person other than the
Guarantors, (g) the other terms and conditions (excluding those referenced in
_clauses (b)_ through _(f)_ above) of such Refinancing Facility or
Refinancing Notes shall be substantially identical to, or (taken as a whole)
no more favorable (as reasonably determined by the Borrower) to the lenders
providing such Refinancing Facility or Refinancing Notes than, those
applicable to the loans or commitments being refinanced or replaced (except
for covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the latest
final maturity date of the relevant loans or commitments existing at the time
of such refinancing or replacement), (h) the aggregate principal amount of
any Refinancing Facility or any Refinancing Notes shall not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and commitments being refinanced or
replaced therewith, plus interest, premiums, fees and expenses or to the
extent otherwise permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Documentation, (i)
in the case of any Refinancing Revolving Facility, the Senior Secured Credit
Documentation shall include certain provisions to govern the pro rata payment,
borrowing, participation and commitment reduction of the Revolving Facility
and any such Refinancing Revolving Facility, and (h) only a Refinancing Term
Facility that is pari passu in right of payment and security with the Term
Loan Facility and shall share ratably in any voluntary or mandatory
prepayments of the term loans being refinanced unless the Borrower and the
lenders in respect of such Refinancing Term Facility elect lesser payments. 
   | 
   _Interest Rates_ : |  | At the Borrowers option, Loans may be
maintained from time to time as (x) Base Rate Loans, which shall bear interest
at the Base Rate in effect from time to time _plus_ the Applicable Margin (as
defined below) or (y) LIBOR Loans, which shall bear interest at LIBOR
(adjusted for statutory reserve requirements) as determined by the
Administrative Agent for the respective interest period (but, in the case of
Term Loans only, no less than 0.75%), _plus_ the Applicable Margin,
_provided_ , that all Swingline Loans shall bear interest based upon the Base
Rate. 
   |

Borrowers financial statements in respect of its first full fiscal quarter
ending at least six months after the 
 



B-14 ---|---|---

Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 12 months, shall be available in the case of
LIBOR Loans. 
   | 
   |  | Interest in respect of Base Rate Loans shall be payable quarterly
in arrears on the last business day of each calendar quarter. Interest in
respect of LIBOR Loans shall be payable in arrears at the end of the
applicable interest period and every three months in the case of interest
periods in excess of three months. Interest will also be payable at the time
of repayment of any Loans and at maturity. All interest on Base Rate Loans,
LIBOR Loans and commitment fees and any other fees shall be based on a
360-day year and actual days elapsed (or, in the case of Base Rate Loans
determined by reference to the prime lending rate, a 365/366-day year and
actual days elapsed). 
   | 
   _Default Interest_ : |  | Overdue principal, interest and other
overdue amounts shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate

(or, if any such amount does not relate to a borrowing under a specific
tranche of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the rate which is 2.0% in
excess of the rate applicable to Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate
Loans). Such interest shall be payable on demand. 
   | 
   _Yield Protection_ : |  | The Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall
include customary protective provisions for such matters as capital adequacy,

with respect to contingencies described in the immediately
preceding sentence. 
   |

0.35%, on the daily undrawn portion of the commitments of each Lender under
the Revolving Credit Facility (for such purpose, disregarding outstanding
Swingline Loans as a utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility), will
commence accruing on the Closing Date and will be payable quarterly in
arrears; _provided_ that so long as no default or event of default exists
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (and, in any event, not commencing
until the delivery of the Borrowers financial statements in respect of its
first full fiscal quarter ending at least six months after the Closing Date),
such commitment fee shall be subject to two step-downs of 0.05% each based on
meeting specified Total Net Leverage Ratio tests to be mutually agreed. 
   | 
   _Letter of Credit Fees_ : |  | A letter of credit fee equal to the
Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans maintained as LIBOR Loans on the
outstanding stated amount of Letters of Credit (the " _Letter of Credit Fee_
") to be shared proportionately by the Lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility in accordance with their participation in the respective Letter of
Credit, and a facing fee of 1/8 of 1% per annum (the " _Facing Fee_ ") to be

materiality) on and as of the date of each borrowing of a Loan and each
issuance of a Letter of Credit (although any representations and warranties
which expressly relate to a given date or period shall be required to be true
and correct in all material respects (or, in 
 



B-16 ---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  |  |  | all respects, if qualified by materiality) as of the
respective date or for the respective period, as the case may be), before and
after giving effect to such borrowing or issuance and to the application of
the proceeds therefrom, as though made on and as of such date; _provided_
that (x) the only representations and warranties the accuracy of which shall
be a condition to the initial funding on the Closing Date are the Acquisition

respect to any Incremental Term Loan Facility the proceeds of which are used
to finance a Limited Conditionality Acquisition, the limitations described
above under the heading "Incremental Facilities" shall apply. 
   |  | 
   |  | (ii) |  | Except in connection with Loans made and Letters of
Credit issued on the Closing Date, no event of default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both would be an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, shall have occurred and be continuing, or would result from any
borrowing of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit; _provided_ that with
respect to any Incremental Term Loan Facility the proceeds of which are used
to finance a Limited Conditionality Acquisition, no default or event of
default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, or after giving
effect to, entry into the applicable acquisition agreement. 
   |

Documentation will contain provisions pursuant to which, subject to no default
or event of default, limitations on investments, _pro_ _forma_ compliance with
the Financial Covenants (whether or not then in effect) and other conditions
to be mutually agreed, the Borrower will be permitted to designate any
existing or subsequently acquired or organized subsidiary as an "unrestricted
subsidiary" and subsequently re-designate any such unrestricted subsidiary as
a restricted subsidiary; _provided_ that (i) any subsidiary previously
designated as an unrestricted subsidiary may not thereafter be re-designated
as an unrestricted subsidiary, and (ii) no subsidiary may be designated as an
unrestricted subsidiary, unless it is also an "unrestricted subsidiary" for
purposes of other material debt. The designation of any subsidiary as an
"unrestricted" subsidiary shall constitute an investment for purposes of the
investment covenant in the Senior Secured Credit Documentation in an amount
equal to the fair market value thereof, and the designation of any
unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary shall be deemed to be an
incurrence of indebtedness and liens by a restricted subsidiary of any
outstanding indebtedness or liens, as applicable, of such unrestricted

limited exceptions to be mutually agreed, unrestricted subsidiaries will not
be subject to the representations and warranties, affirmative or negative
covenants or events of default provisions of the Senior Secured Credit

and interest expense of unrestricted subsidiaries will not be taken into
account for purposes of determining compliance with the Financial Covenants or
financial tests contained in such Senior Secured Credit Documentation;

subsidiaries will be subject to representations and warranties, covenants and
event of default provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Documentation with
respect to matters related to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, OFAC and other
sanctions, anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws. 
  



B-20 ---|---|--- 
     _Events of Default_ : |  | Events of Default (to be applicable to
the Borrower and its subsidiaries) will be limited to the following, in each
case (where applicable), with materiality thresholds, exceptions and
qualifications to be mutually agreed: (i) nonpayment of principal or Letter
of Credit drawings when due or interest, fees or other amounts after a grace
period to be mutually agreed; (ii) any representation or warranty proving to
have been incorrect in any material respect (or, in any respect, if qualified
by materiality) when made or confirmed; (iii) failure to perform or observe
covenants set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Documentation, subject (where
customary and appropriate) to notice and an appropriate grace period to be
mutually agreed; (iv) cross-defaults and cross-acceleration to other
indebtedness in an amount to be mutually agreed; (v) bankruptcy, insolvency
proceedings, etc. (with a grace period for involuntary proceedings to be
mutually agreed); (vi) inability to pay debts, attachment, etc.; (vii)
judgment defaults in an amount to be mutually agreed; (viii) customary ERISA
defaults; (ix) actual or asserted invalidity of Senior Secured Credit
Documentation or subordination provisions or impairment of security interests
in the Collateral; and (x) Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
breach of the Financial Covenants as a "financial maintenance covenant" (and
not as a separate governor for other conditions, baskets, etc.) shall not
constitute an event of default for the purposes of the Term Loan Facility,
unless the Required Revolving Lenders (as defined below) have accelerated the
Revolving Credit Facility and/or terminated the commitments in
respect thereof as a result of such breach. 
   | 
   _Assignments and Participations_ : |  | The Borrower may not assign
its rights or obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any
Lender may assign, and may sell participations in, its rights and obligations
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, subject (x) in the case of
participations, to customary restrictions on the voting rights of the
participants and restrictions on participations to the Borrower and its
affiliates and (y) in the case of assignments, to such limitations as may be
established by the Administrative Agent (including (i) a minimum assignment
amount of $1.0 million in the case of any Term Loan and $5.0 million in the
case of any Loans and/or commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility (or,
if less, the entire amount of such assignors commitments and outstanding
Loans at such time), (ii) an assignment fee in the amount of $3,500 to be paid
by the respective assignor or assignee to the Administrative Agent, (iii)
restrictions on assignments to any entity that is not an Eligible Transferee
(to be defined to exclude Disqualified Institutions (to the extent the
identity of such Disqualified Institution has been made available by the
Borrower to all Lenders), natural 
 



B-21 ---|---|--- 
    |  |

persons and, except in connection with a Borrower Buy-Back (as defined below),
the Borrower and its affiliates), (iv) except in the case of an assignment to
any Lender, its affiliates or an "approved fund" of a Lender, the receipt of
the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no default or event of
default exists under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Borrower (such
consent, in any such case, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), _provided_ that such consent of the Borrower shall be deemed to
have been given if the Borrower has not responded within ten business days of
a request for such consents, and (v) in the case of the assignment of any
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, the consent of the Swingline
Lender and each Primary Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit (such consent, in
each case, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)). The
Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall provide for a mechanism which will
allow for each assignee to become a direct signatory to the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and will relieve the assigning Lender of its obligations
with respect to the assigned portion of its commitment and/or Loans, as
applicable. Assignments will be by novation and will not be required to be
_pro_ _rata_ among the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In no event shall
the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to
whether any person is a Disqualified Institution, and the Administrative Agent
shall not have any liability (or duties) with respect to or arising out
of any assignment or participation of loans to, or the restrictions on any
exercise of any rights or remedies of, any Disqualified Institution.



 

The Senior Secured Credit Documentation shall provide that Term Loans may be
purchased by, and assigned to, the Borrower on a non-pro rata basis through
Dutch auctions open to all Lenders with Term Loans on a pro rata basis in
accordance with procedures to be agreed; _provided_ that (i) no default or
event of default then exists under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
would result therefrom, (ii) any such purchase is made at a discount to par,
(iii) the Borrower shall make a representation that it is not in possession of
any material non-public information, (iv) any such Term Loans shall be
automatically and permanently cancelled immediately upon purchase by the
Borrower, (v) the Borrower shall not be permitted to use the proceeds of
Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans to purchase Term Loans, and (vi) other
conditions as may be required by the Administrative Agent (any such purchase
and assignment, a " _Borrower Buy-Back_ "). 

   | 
   _Waivers and Amendments_ : |  | Amendments and waivers of the
provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Documentation will require the
approval of Lenders holding commitments and/or outstandings (as appropriate)
representing more than 50% of the aggregate commitments and outstandings
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the " _Required Lenders_ "),
except that (a) the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby will
be required 
 



B-22 ---|---|--- 
    |  |

with respect to (i) increases in commitment amounts of such Lender, (ii)
reductions of principal, interest or fees of such Lender, (iii) extensions of
scheduled payments of any Loans (including at final maturity) or times for
payment of interest or fees of such Lender, (iv) amendments to the collateral
proceeds waterfall and (v) modifications to the _pro_ _rata_ sharing
and payment provisions, assignment provisions or the voting percentages, (b)
the consent of all of the Lenders shall be required with respect to releases
of all or substantially all of the Collateral or the value of the Guaranties
provided by the Guarantors taken as a whole, (c) the consent of each Letter
of Credit issuer, the Swingline Lender and/or the Administrative Agent shall,
as applicable, be required with respect to any amendment that adversely
affects their respective rights and duties and (d) class voting rights for
Lenders under each affected tranche of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
shall be required for certain types of amendments and waivers; _provided_ that
if any of the matters described in _clause (a)_ or _(b)_ above is agreed to
by the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall have the right to either (x)
substitute any non-consenting Lender by having its Loans and commitments
assigned, at par, to one or more other institutions, subject to the
assignment provisions described above or (y) with the express written consent
of the Required Lenders, terminate the commitment of, and repay the
obligations owing to, any non-consenting Lender, subject to repayment in full
of all obligations of the Borrower owed to such Lender relating to the Loans
and participations held by such Lender (including any Prepayment Premium).



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, amendments to and waivers of the Financial
Covenants (solely as it applies to the Financial Covenants as
"financial maintenance covenants" (and not as a separate governor for other
conditions, baskets etc.)) and defined terms as used therein shall only
require the approval of Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate amount
of the commitments and/or outstandings under the Revolving Credit Facility
(the " _Required Revolving Lenders_ ").



 

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Documentation shall provide for the
amendment (or amendment and restatement) of the Senior Secured Credit
Documentation to provide for a new tranche of replacement term loans to
replace all or a portion of the term loans of a given tranche under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, subject to customary limitations (including as to
tenor, weighted average life to maturity, "effective yield" not exceeding
that applicable to the tranche of term loans so replaced, prepayment
ratability provisions and applicable covenants prior to the Term Loan Maturity
Date), with the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the
lenders providing such replacement term loans. 

  



B-23 ---|---|--- 
     |  | The Senior Secured Credit Documentation will contain
customary "amend and extend" provisions pursuant to which the Borrower, with
the approval of consenting Lenders, may extend the maturity of Term Loans of
such consenting Lenders and, in connection therewith, amend the interest
rates, yield, fees, amortization (so long as the weighted average life to
maturity is not shortened) and prepayment provisions applicable to such
extended Term Loans; _provided_ that the application of voluntary and
mandatory prepayments shall not be on a greater than pro rata basis with any
non-extending Term Loans. 
   | 
   _Defaulting Lenders_ : |  | If any Lender under the Revolving Credit
Facility becomes a Defaulting Lender (to be defined on terms satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent) at any time, then, so long as no default or event of
default then exists, the exposure of such Defaulting Lender with respect to
Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit will automatically be reallocated among
the non-Defaulting Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility pro rata in
accordance with their commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility up to
an amount such that the aggregate credit exposure of such non-Defaulting
Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility does not exceed its commitment
thereunder. In the event such reallocation does not fully cover the exposure
of such Defaulting Lender (or such reallocation is not then permitted), the
Swingline Lender or applicable Letter of Credit issuer may require the
Borrower to repay or cash collateralize, as applicable, such "uncovered"
exposure in respect of the Swingline Loans or Letter of Credit outstandings,
as the case may be, and will have no obligation to make new Swingline Loans or
issue new Letters of Credit, as applicable, to the extent such Swingline Loans
or Letter of Credit outstandings, as applicable, would exceed the unused
commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
   | 
   _Indemnification; Expenses_ : |  | The Senior Secured Credit
Documentation will contain customary indemnities for the Administrative Agent,
the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Lenders and their respective affiliates and
controlling persons and the employees, officers, agents and advisors of the
foregoing as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (including,
without limitation, for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses of
the Lenders incurred after the occurrence, and during the continuance of, an
event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities); _provided_ that
the Borrower shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than
one primary counsel for the Administrative Agent, one regulatory counsel in
each applicable specialty, one local or foreign counsel for each relevant
jurisdiction, one other counsel for all other Lenders and their respective
affiliates, employees, officers and agents and, in each case, if reasonably
necessary or advisable in the judgment of the affected person in the case of
an actual or perceived conflict of interest, an additional regulatory counsel
in each applicable specialty and one additional local or foreign counsel in
each such applicable jurisdiction, 
 



B-24 ---|---|--- 
    |  |

in each case other than as a result of such persons gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in
a final and non-appealable decision.



The Senior Secured Credit Documentation will require the Borrower to pay all
reasonable and documented expenses of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline
Lender, each issuer of Letters of Credit, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the
Lenders associated with the syndication of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the
Senior Secured Credit Documentation and any amendment or waiver with respect
thereto and in connection with the enforcement of the Senior Secured Credit
Documentation. 

   | 
   _Governing Law and Forum_ : |  | All Senior Secured Credit
Documentation shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York
(except security documentation that the Administrative Agent determines should
be governed by local or foreign law). The Borrower and the Guarantors will
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any New York State court or
Federal court sitting in the County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, and
appellate courts thereof (except to the extent the Administrative Agent
requires submission to any other jurisdiction in connection with the exercise
of any rights under any security document or the enforcement of any judgment).

 _Project Falcon_

 

 _$2,700,000,000 Senior Secured Credit Facilities_

 

 _Summary of Additional Conditions Precedent_

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit C_ but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the commitment letter to which this _Exhibit C_ is
attached (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") and in the other Exhibits to the
Commitment Letter. In the case of any such capitalized term that is subject to
multiple and differing definitions, the appropriate meaning thereof in this
_Exhibit C_ shall be determined by reference to the context in which it is
used.

The initial borrowing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall be
subject to the following additional conditions precedent:

1\. The Initial Lenders commitments under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will be subject to the execution and delivery by the Borrower and
Guarantors of definitive Senior Secured Credit Documentation consistent with
the terms of the Commitment Letter and the Term Sheet and this Summary of
Additional Conditions Precedent, in each case prepared by counsel to the
Agents.

2\. The Acquisition Agreement shall be in full force and effect. Concurrently
with the initial funding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
Acquisition shall have been consummated in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Agreement, and the Acquisition Agreement shall
not have been amended, modified, supplemented or any provision or condition
therein waived by the Borrower, and neither the Borrower nor any affiliate
thereof shall have consented to any action which would require the consent of
the Borrower or such affiliate under the Acquisition Agreement, if such
amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent would be adverse to the
interests of the Lenders in any material respect, in any such case without
the prior written consent of the Agents (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent (a) that decreases
the purchase price in respect of the Acquisition shall not be deemed to
be adverse to the interests of the Lenders in any material respect, so long
as such decrease is allocated to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the
Term Loan Facility, (b) that results in any increase in the purchase price in
respect of the Acquisition shall not be deemed to be adverse to the interests
of the Lenders in any material respect, so long as such increase is funded
solely by an issuance of common equity interests of the Borrower, and (c) of
the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement as in effect
on the date hereof) shall be deemed to be adverse to the interests of the
Lenders in a material respect).

 

3\. (a) Except as set forth in the forms, documents and reports required to be
filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by the Target with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") filed or furnished
with the SEC since December 31, 2013 (including exhibits and other information
incorporated by reference therein) and publicly available prior to the date
hereof on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System
(but  excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any "risk factors"
section, any disclosures in any "forward-looking statements" section and any
other disclosures included therein to the extent they are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) where the applicability of such disclosure as an
exception to a particular representation is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure or in the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in the
Acquisition Agreement on the date hereof), from December 28, 2014 through the
date of the Acquisition Agreement there has not occurred any event,
development, occurrence, or change that has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse
Effect and (b) no change, event or effect shall have arisen or occurred
following the date of the Acquisition Agreement and be continuing as
of immediately prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer, which,
individually or in the aggregate, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to constitute, a Target Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, a " _Target
Material Adverse Effect_ " means a change, event or effect that is materially
adverse to the business, results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of the Target and its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement), taken as a whole, but shall not include changes, events or
effects relating to or resulting from: (i) changes or developments in economic
or political conditions or in securities, credit or financial markets,
including changes in interest rates and changes in exchange rates, (ii)
changes or developments in or affecting the industries in which the Target and
its Subsidiaries operate, including changes in Law (as defined in the
Acquisition Agreement) or regulation affecting such industries, (iii) the
execution and delivery of the Acquisition Agreement or the public announcement
or pendency of the Tender Offer or Merger or the other Transactions (as
defined in the Acquisition Agreement for purposes of this paragraph 3),
including the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise,
of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, including with employees, customers,
suppliers, distributors or partners, (iv) the identity of the Borrower or any
of its affiliates as the acquiror of the Target, or its or their plans for
the Target, (v) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action
required by, the Acquisition Agreement or consented to by the Borrower, (vi)
any acts of terrorism or war, acts of God, natural disasters, weather
conditions or other calamities, (vii) changes in GAAP or the interpretation
thereof, (viii) any stockholder class action, derivative or similar litigation
relating to the Acquisition Agreement or the Transactions, (ix) any failure
to meet internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earning
predictions for any period, including analyst expectations or projections,
forecasts or predictions or (x) any decrease or decline in the market price
or trading volume of the Company Common Stock (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement) ( _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (ix) and (x), the facts
and circumstances underlying any such failure, decrease or decline may be
taken into account in determining whether a Target Material Adverse Effect has
occurred), except in the case of _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(vi)_ and _(vii)_
to the extent that the Target and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are
disproportionately affected thereby relative to other peers in the industries
in which the Target and its Subsidiaries operate.

 

4\. All obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations for which no
claim has been made) of the Borrower, its subsidiaries and the Acquired
Business with respect to the indebtedness being refinanced pursuant to the
Refinancing shall have been paid in full (or irrevocable notice for the
repayment or redemption thereof will be given and accompanied by any
prepayments or deposits required to defease, terminate and satisfy in full
any related indentures or notes), and all commitments, security interests and
guaranties in connection therewith shall have been terminated and released.
After giving effect to the consummation of the Transaction, the Borrower and
its subsidiaries shall have no outstanding preferred equity or indebtedness,
except for (i) indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit

 



C-2  Facilities, (ii) ordinary course capital leases, purchase money
indebtedness, equipment financings, letters of credit and surety bonds
permitted by the Existing Credit Agreement, (iii) indebtedness incurred
pursuant to any current and noncurrent "Long-term debt" identified in the
Borrowers most recent 10-Q (and the footnotes thereto) filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (except for the Existing Credit
Agreement), (iv) indebtedness of the Acquired Business permitted to remain
outstanding under the Acquisition Agreement (after the consummation of the
Transaction), and (v) such other existing indebtedness, if any, as shall be
permitted by the Joint Lead Arrangers (the indebtedness described in _clauses
(ii)_ through _(v)_ , the " _Permitted Surviving Indebtedness_ ").

 

5\. Subject to the Certain Funds Provision, the Guaranties and Security
Agreements required by the Term Sheet shall have been executed and delivered
by the Borrower and Guarantors and, subject to the Funds Certain Provisions,
the Lenders shall have a perfected security interest in all assets of the
Borrower and the Guarantors constituting Collateral as, and to the extent,
required by the Term Sheet.

6\. The Lenders shall have received (1) legal opinions from counsel in
customary form, scope and substance, (2) a solvency certificate as to the
solvency of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis after
giving effect to the Transaction, in the form attached hereto as _Annex A_ ,
from the chief financial officer of the Borrower and (3) other customary
closing and corporate documents, resolutions, certificates and lien searches.

7\. The Agents shall have received (1) audited consolidated balance sheets
and related statements of income and cash flows of each of the Borrower and
the Acquired Business for the three most recently ended fiscal years of the
Borrower or the Acquired Business, as applicable, ended at least 90 days
prior to the Closing Date, (2) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and
related statements of income and cash flows of the Borrower and the Acquired
Business for each fiscal quarter of the Borrower or the Acquired Business, as
applicable, ended after the close of its most recent fiscal year and at least
45 days prior to the Closing Date, and (3) _pro_ _forma_ consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Business) and a _pro_ _forma_ consolidated statement of income of
the Borrower for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the most
recently completed four fiscal quarter period ended at least 45 days before
the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP and after giving effect to
the Transaction as if the Transaction had occurred at the beginning of such
period.

 

8\. The Borrower (a) shall have delivered (or caused to be delivered) the
Information Materials to the Joint Lead Arrangers (it being understood and
agreed that such information shall not include any information customarily
delivered by an investment bank in the preparation of the Information
Materials) and (b) shall have provided the Joint Lead Arrangers a period
(the " _Marketing Period_ ") of not less than 15 consecutive Business Days
after Joint Lead Arrangers receipt of the Information Materials and the
applicable financial statements referred to in _paragraph 7_ above then
required to have been delivered at the time of the receipt of the Information
Materials (the " _Required Information_ ") to attempt to syndicate the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities ( _provided_ that solely for purposes of this
_clause (b)_ and each determination made herein in reference to the delivery
of financial statements prior to "Closing Date" as used in _paragraph 7_ , the
reference to "Closing Date" as so used in _paragraph 7_ shall mean the date
on which the Borrower shall have delivered the Information Materials to the
Joint Lead Arrangers in

 



C-3  accordance with _clause (a)_ above; and _provided_ , _further_ , that (i)
November 25, 2015, November 27, 2015, July 1, 2016 and July 5, 2016 shall not
be included in determining such consecutive Business Day period, (ii) the
Marketing Period shall either end on or prior to December 18, 2015 or, if the
Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to December 18, 2015, then the
Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than January 4, 2016, (iii) the
Marketing Period shall either end on or prior to August 19, 2016 or, if the
Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to August 19, 2016, then
the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 6, 2016 and
(iv) if the Marketing Period as otherwise provided above has not been
completed and the Borrower is obligated to deliver new financial statements
pursuant to  _paragraph 7_ in respect of a subsequent fiscal period that do
not constitute Required Information, then the Joint Lead Arrangers shall have
a period of not less than three consecutive Business Days from receipt of such
financial statements to attempt to syndicate the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the "Marketing Period" shall, if otherwise expiring before such
three Business Day period, be so extended to allow such minimum additional
period). If the Borrower shall in good faith reasonably believe that it has
delivered the Required Information pursuant to this _paragraph 8_ , the
Borrower may deliver to the Joint Lead Arrangers written notice to that effect
(stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the
Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied its requirements under this
paragraph 8 with respect to the Required Information on the date specified in
such notice and the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the
date specified in such notice, in each case unless the Joint Lead Arrangers
in good faith reasonably believe that the Borrower has not delivered the
Required Information pursuant to this _paragraph 8_ and, within two business
days after their receipt of such notice from the Borrower, the Joint Lead
Arrangers deliver a written notice to the Borrower to that effect (stating
with specificity the Required Information required under this _paragraph 8_
that the Borrower has not delivered). For purposes of this section, "
_Business Day_ " means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on
which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is closed.

and the Lenders or otherwise payable in respect of the Transaction shall have
been paid to the extent due pursuant to the Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter and invoiced prior to the Closing Date.

five Business Days prior to the Closing Date all documentation and other
information required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including
without limitation the PATRIOT Act.

 



C-4 _Annex A to Exhibit C_

 

 _FORM OF SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE_

 

[●], 

 

This Solvency Certificate is being executed and delivered pursuant to _Section
[●]_ of that certain [●]1 (the " _Credit Agreement_ "); the terms defined
therein being used herein as therein defined.

 

I, [●], the chief financial officer of the Borrower, solely in such capacity
and not in an individual capacity, hereby certify that I am the chief
financial officer of the Borrower and that I am generally familiar with the
businesses and assets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole),
and I am duly authorized to execute this Solvency Certificate on behalf of
the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

I further certify, solely in my capacity as chief financial officer of the
Borrower, and not in my individual capacity, as of the date hereof and after
giving effect to the Transaction and the incurrence of the indebtedness and
obligations being incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement and the
Transaction on the date hereof, that, (i) the sum of the debt (including
contingent liabilities) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, does not exceed the fair value of the present assets of the Borrower
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) the present fair saleable value
of the assets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not
less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities
(including contingent liabilities) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, on their debts as they become absolute and matured; (iii)
the capital of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not
unreasonably small in relation to the business of the Borrower or
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, contemplated as of the date hereof; and
(iv) the Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are able to pay
their debts (including current obligations and contingent liabilities) as such
debts mature and do not intend to incur, or believe that they will incur,
debts (including current obligations and contingent liabilities) beyond their
ability to pay such debt as they mature in the ordinary course of business.
For the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time
shall be computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether
such contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 450 (Topic 450,
"Contingencies")).
