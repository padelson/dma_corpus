This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (as the same may be amended or
modified from time to time, this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of August 30,
2018 (the " _Execution Date_ "), by and between SOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY, a
Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ ") and FLYWHEEL ENERGY OPERATING, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "). Seller and Buyer are
sometimes hereinafter referred to individually as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

WHEREAS, effective as of the Effective Time (as defined below), Seller desires
to sell and transfer, and Buyer desires to purchase and pay for, the
Interests (as defined below); and

WHEREAS, the Parties have reached agreement regarding the sale and purchase
of the Interests.

NOW, THEREFORE, based on the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained,
the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

 

1.1 _Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings given such terms in  _Appendix A_.

1.2 _References and Rules of Construction_. All references in this Agreement
to Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer
to the corresponding, Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections and other
subdivisions of or to this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise.
References to Exhibits and Schedules are to the Exhibits and Schedules,
respectively, to the Disclosure Letter. Titles appearing at the beginning of
any Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement
are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement,
and shall be disregarded in construing the language hereof. The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar
import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article,
Section, subsection or other subdivision unless expressly so limited. The
words "this Article," "this Section" and "this subsection," and words of
similar import, refer only to the Article, Section or subsection hereof in
which such words occur. Wherever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limiting the foregoing in any respect." All references to
"$" or "dollars" shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Each
accounting term not defined herein will have the meaning given to it under
GAAP as interpreted as of the Execution Date. Pronouns in masculine, feminine
or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other gender,
and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular
form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the
context otherwise requires. The words "shall" and "will" are used
interchangeably throughout this Agreement and shall accordingly be given the
same meaning, regardless of which word is used. Except as expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement, references to any Law or agreement means such Law
or agreement as it may be amended from time to time. References to any date
means such date in Houston, Texas, and for purposes of calculating the time
period in

 



1

    

 which any notice or action is to be given or undertaken hereunder, such
period shall be deemed to begin at 12:01 a.m. on the applicable date in
Houston, Texas. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the
degree or proportion to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if". With respect to all dates and time periods
in this Agreement, time is of the essence. Unless this Agreement expressly
provides otherwise to the contrary, when calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
day other than a Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day.

 

ARTICLE 2

2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and subject to the conditions contained
in this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to
purchase, accept and pay for, the Interests, free and clear of all

Societies, as interpreted by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies

(i) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses (including prepayments) paid by
(A) either Company prior to (but not after) Closing and/or (B) Seller or any

(v) if applicable and to the extent not reimbursed by Buyer, the amounts set

(vii) the sum of (x) an amount equal to the value of the vacation or

an amount equal 50% of the amounts payable by Buyer or one of its Affiliates

(viii) if applicable and to the extent not paid to Buyer, the amounts set
forth in _Section(i)(ii)_ of _Schedule 9.23_ ;

(x) the amount of Indebtedness of the Companies as of the Closing Date; and

(xi) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer.

(c) For purposes of determining the amount of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, the principles set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c) _shall apply except as expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence and except for
amounts for which the Purchase Price is adjusted hereunder: (i) Seller shall
remain entitled to all of the rights of ownership (including the right to all
production, proceeds of production and other proceeds, if any) and shall
remain responsible for all Operating Expenses, in each case attributable to
the Assets for the period of time prior to the Effective Time and all Excluded
Assets, and (ii) subject to the occurrence of the Closing, each
applicable Company shall be entitled to all of the rights of ownership
(including the right to all production, proceeds of production and other
proceeds) attributable to the Assets for the period of time from and after the
Effective Time, and shall be responsible for all Operating Expenses
attributable to the Assets for the period of time from and after the Effective
Time. Such amounts that are received, paid or properly accrued prior to
Closing shall be accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or
Final Settlement Statement as applicable. From and after the date of the Final
Settlement

 Statement, (1) Buyer shall cause the applicable Company to fully disclose,
account for and remit to Seller any revenues to which Seller is entitled
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c) _on or before the tenth day after
each Companys or its Affiliates receipt of same and (2) Seller shall fully
disclose, account for and remit to the applicable Company any revenues to
which such Company is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_ on or
before the tenth day after Sellers or its Affiliates receipt of same. For
the avoidance of doubt, the date an item or work is ordered is not the date
of a transaction for settlement purposes in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement or Final Settlement Statement, as applicable, but rather the date on
which the item ordered is delivered to the job site, or the date on which the
work ordered is performed, is the relevant date (i.e., on an accrual basis).
"Earned" and "incurred", as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in
accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, subject to the other provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. For purposes of allocating production (and
accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_,
(a) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are transported from the lands covered by the
applicable Well, or if there are no storage facilities, when they pass through
the LACT meter or similar meter at the entry point into the pipelines through
which they are transported from such lands and (b) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall
be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Wells when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters or similar meters at the entry point into the
pipelines through which they are transported from such lands. The Parties
shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation
of production when exact meter readings (including gas production meters or
sales meters) or gauging and strapping data is not available.

2.4 _Preliminary Settlement Statement_. No later than the twelfth (12th)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and submit to
Buyer for review a draft settlement statement (the " _Preliminary Settlement
Statement_ ") that shall set forth an estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price,
reflecting Sellers good faith estimate of each proposed adjustment to be made
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ as of the date of preparation of
such Preliminary Settlement Statement, together with the designation of
Sellers accounts for the wire transfers of funds as set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 11.3(a)_. Seller shall supply to Buyer reasonable documentation in the
possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates to support the items for which
adjustments are proposed or made in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
delivered by Seller, and a brief explanation of any such adjustments and the
reasons therefor. On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day after Buyers
receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a written report containing all changes that Buyer proposes to be made
to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any, together with an explanation
of such changes. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the
Parties, shall be used to calculate the Adjusted Purchase Price; _provided_
that if the Parties do not agree on any of the adjustments set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, all unagreed upon
adjustments (if any) set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement as
presented by Seller in good faith shall be used to calculate the Adjusted
Purchase Price; _provided further_ that, if Buyer disagrees with
Sellers estimate of any adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(iii)
_or _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(iv)_, then Buyers good faith estimate of such
adjustments shall be used in calculating the Adjusted Purchase Price as of
the Closing Date for the purpose of determining the Adjusted Purchase Price.

2.5 _Final Settlement Statement_. On or before the date that is six months
following the Closing Date, Seller shall submit to Buyer a final settlement
statement (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ "), based on actual adjustments
to the Purchase Price and that takes into account all final adjustments made
to the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and shows the
resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price. Seller shall supply to Buyer
reasonable documentation in the possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates
to support the items for which adjustments are proposed or made in the Final
Settlement Statement delivered by Seller, and a brief explanation of any such
adjustments and the reasons therefor. The Final Settlement Statement shall set
forth the actual proration of the amounts required by this Agreement. On or
before the 30th Business Day after its receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing
any proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of
any such changes and the reasons therefor (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Any
changes not included in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived,
and Sellers determinations with respect to all such adjustments in the Final
Settlement Statement that are not addressed in the Dispute Notice shall,
without limiting _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_, be final and binding on the
Parties. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller
containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final Settlement
Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller shall be
deemed to be agreed upon by the Parties and shall, without limiting _Section_
__ _ 4.2(d)_, be final and binding on the Parties. If the final Adjusted
Purchase Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is agreed upon in
writing by Seller and Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement and the final
Adjusted Purchase Price as so agreed shall, without limiting _Section_ __ _
4.2(d)_, be final and binding on the Parties. If after a timely Dispute Notice
the Parties do not agree in writing to any element of the Final Settlement
Statement, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall apply. Once the final
Adjusted Purchase Price has been agreed (or deemed agreed) upon by the Parties
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or determined by the Accounting
Referee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, as applicable, then, if the final
Adjusted Purchase Price is (a) more than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Buyer
shall pay to a bank account in the United States designated by Seller by
notice to Buyer the amount of such difference or (b) less than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to a bank account in the United States
designated by Buyer by notice to Seller the amount of such difference, in
each case, by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than the
fifth Business Day (or if later, the third Business Day after the Party to
receive funds notifies the Party to pay funds of the account) after the date
such final Adjusted Purchase Price is agreed, or deemed agreed, pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5 _shall limit Buyers rights to
exercise the dispute rights and audit rights in Section 3(b) and Section 3(c)
of the Transition Services Agreement.

2.6 _Disputes_. If at any time after the 30th day following Sellers receipt
of the Dispute Notice Seller and Buyer have not resolved in writing all of
the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice, Buyer or Seller, by notice to the
other, may refer any remaining unagreed matters to an Accounting Referee. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall, on or before the fifth Business Day after the
Accounting Referee has agreed to serve as such or has been appointed by the
Parties or the AAA, as applicable based on the definition of that term,
summarize its position with regard to the disputed adjustments in a written
document of 20 pages or less (not including any supporting documentation) and
submit such summaries to the Accounting Referee, together with the Dispute
Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party
may desire to submit. Seller shall also furnish the Accounting Referee with a
copy of this Agreement. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Referee
that, on or before the 15th Business Day after receiving the Parties
respective submissions, the Accounting Referee shall render a decision

 



6

    

 choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to each
disputed adjustment addressed in any Dispute Notice, whichever is accurate (or
closer to the accurate amount) based on the terms of the Agreement and the
materials described above. The Accounting Referee shall calculate only the
disputed adjustments addressed in the Dispute Notice that have not otherwise
been resolved and agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer after delivery
of the Dispute Notice. Each choice between Sellers position and Buyers
position with respect to any disputed adjustment that is rendered by the
Accounting Referee in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall,
without limiting _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_, be final and binding on Seller and
Buyer and shall be enforceable against each of the Parties in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Referee shall be borne
one half by Buyer and one half by Seller. The final Adjusted Purchase Price
set forth in the Final Settlement Statement incorporating the adjustment
amounts determined by the Accounting Referee in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, in addition to the adjustment amounts agreed to in
writing by the Parties, shall, without limiting _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_, be
final and binding on the Parties. The Accounting Referee shall be authorized
to resolve only the specific disputed aspects of the Final Settlement
Statement submitted by the Parties as provided above and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section_ _ 2.6 _shall limit Buyers rights to exercise the
dispute rights and audit rights in Section 3(b) and Section 3(c) of the
Transition Services Agreement.

2.7 _Allocated Values_. Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the Adjusted
Purchase Price in accordance with the allocation schedule attached as
_Schedule_ __ _ 2.7_ (the " _Allocated Values_ ").

2.8 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Adjusted Purchase Price and any other
items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes
shall be allocated among the assets of the Companies in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate)
(the " _Allocation_ "). To the extent allowed under applicable federal income
tax Law, the Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Allocated Values set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 2.7_. On or before the 90th day
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Allocation for
Sellers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Seller
and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the
Allocation as promptly as practicable. At any time after the tenth day
following Buyers delivery of the Allocation to Seller, if Seller and Buyer
have not resolved any such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved promptly in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. If the
Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Allocation shall
be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall
file all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a
manner consistent with the Allocation. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take
any Tax position inconsistent with such Allocation, as adjusted, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising
out of the Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority challenging such Allocation.

2.9 _Deferred Payment Obligation_. Within ten (10) days after termination of
the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall submit to Buyer an invoice
for an amount equal to (a) the Deferred Payment Amount, minus (b) the actual
aggregate amount of any sales proceeds from the Oil and Gas Properties
attributable to the period after the Effective Time that are withheld by
Seller pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, minus (c)
any portions of the Deferred Payment Amount that Buyer has previously paid to
Seller (the resulting amount, the "Net Deferred Payment Amount"). Within
fifteen days after Buyers receipt from Seller of such invoice, Buyer shall
pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
of Seller set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement the Net Deferred
Payment Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing shall limit Buyers dispute rights and audit rights set forth in
Section 3(b) and Section 3(c) of the Transition Services Agreement with
respect to the determination of the amounts set forth in clause (b) of the
definition of Net Deferred Payment Amount. For clarity, Buyer shall have the
right at any time after the Closing (and prior to the due date of the Net
Deferred Payment Amount) to pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of Seller set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement all or any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount
that then-remains outstanding.

3.1 _Casualty Loss_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets.

 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, any portion of the
Assets suffers a Casualty Loss, then Buyer and Seller shall, subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article_
__ _ 10_, nevertheless be required to Close, and in the case of any
individual Casualty Loss in excess of $1,000,000 in Casualty Loss Amount,
Seller shall elect by notice to Buyer prior to Closing either (i) to cause, at
Sellers sole cost and expense, the Asset affected by such Casualty Loss to be
repaired or restored to a quality and condition comparable to that existing
with respect to the Asset as before such Casualty Loss as promptly as
reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date, but no
longer than the Title Cure Period, so long as at the Closing Seller and the
applicable Companies enter into an access and indemnity agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Parties and on substantially the same
terms set forth with respect to Buyers pre-Closing access rights in
_Sections_ __ _ 3.3(c), (e) and (f)_ below with respect to Sellers access to
the Assets) or (ii) to reduce the unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing by the
Casualty Loss Amount attributable to such Casualty Loss (and in the event
Seller has made the election under the foregoing _clause (i)_ but not
completed such repair or restoration as of the Title Cure Period, then this
_clause (ii)_ shall apply to the extent and only to the extent of any
unrepaired or unrestored damage); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Buyer be entitled to any remedy with respect to any Casualty Loss when
the Casualty Loss Amount does not equal or exceed $1,000,000. With respect to
any such Casualty Loss for which the Purchase Price is reduced pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ or which Seller has repaired or restored as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_, Seller shall be entitled to receive
and retain as an Excluded Asset all of its and the Companies rights to
insurance and other Claims with respect to such Casualty Loss, except to the
extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

3.2 _Insurance Matters_. Buyer understands and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, (a) no insurance coverage needs to be provided to any Company or
Buyer with respect to the properties and assets of the Companies under any

Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Company) directly against or under any
of such insurance policies, regardless of their date of issuance.

3.3 _Access_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the other
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and obtaining any required consents of
Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the Assets (which consents
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companies
to obtain, but neither Seller nor any Company shall be required to pay any
consideration therefor), Seller shall afford (and cause each Company to
afford) to Buyer and its Representatives, upon reasonable prior notice,
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Assets and all
Records in Sellers, the Companies or any of their Affiliates possession.
All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer and its
Representatives shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense,
and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or its
Representatives shall result from Buyers own independent review and judgment.
Buyer shall coordinate such access rights and physical inspections of the
Assets with Seller so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
business by Seller, any Company or the operator of the Assets. Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by Sellers and any Third Party
operators applicable safety rules, regulations and operating policies
(provided __ to Buyer in advance in writing) while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or other
inspection or assessment of the Assets. Seller or its designee shall have the
right to accompany Buyer or its Representatives whenever they are on site on
the Assets.

 

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property
assessment with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties and the Gathering
Systems, but notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ to the
contrary, (i) no Invasive Activity shall be conducted by Buyer or its
Representatives upon the Oil and Gas Properties, the Gathering Systems or any
other Assets without the prior written consent of Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in the event that (x) Buyers Phase I has identified any actual
"Recognized Environmental Conditions" (as such conditions are defined or
described under the current American Society for Testing and Material Standard
Practice Designation E1527-13) and Buyers consultant recommends an Invasive
Activity to further evaluate such Recognized Environmental Conditions, (y)
Buyer has delivered a written notice to Seller, setting forth Buyers plans
for conducting such Invasive Activity (including the identity of the
consultant who will conduct such Invasive Activity) and requesting Sellers
consent to conduct such an Invasive Activity (including the corresponding
portions of the Phase I identifying the Recognized Environmental Condition),
and (z) Buyer has consented to the consultant selected to conduct such
Invasive Activity and the plans with respect to conducting such Invasive
Activity, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, then

 Buyer shall be permitted to conduct such Invasive Activity, to the limited
extent expressly set forth in such consultant recommendations and the plan,
and (ii) none of Buyer or its Representatives shall have access to, have the
right to review or otherwise be permitted to conduct any on-site inspection

Properties and Gathering Systems.

(c) Buyer hereby releases, indemnifies, defends and holds harmless each of
the operators of the Assets and the members of the Seller Group (including the
Companies) from and against any and all Claims (including any injury, loss or
damage arising out of such entry that may occur to any member of the Buyer
Group), arising out of, resulting from or relating to any office visit, field
visit, environmental property assessment or other due diligence activity
conducted by Buyer or its Representatives with respect to the Assets, EVEN IF
SUCH CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP, EXCEPTING ONLY CLAIMS TO THE
EXTENT ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP OR SOLELY FROM THE MERE DISCOVERY
BY BUYER OF PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CONDITIONS NOT CREATED OR EXACERBATED BY
BUYER.

 

(d) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, but no later than the
Environmental Defect Claim Date, copies of all final environmental
reports and environmental test results prepared prior to such date by Buyer
and/or any of its Representatives which contain environmental data collected
or generated prior to such date from Buyers environmental due diligence with
respect to the Assets. None of Buyer, any of its Representatives or Seller
shall be deemed by Sellers receipt of such documents, or otherwise, to have
made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to
the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the
information contained therein. Buyer Group shall keep and maintain
confidential (and not disclose to any other Person including any Governmental
Authority, in whole or in part) pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement any results of (or reports or other documents arising from) an
environmental assessment of the Assets in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and shall prior to Closing use such results, reports
or other documents arising therefrom solely for purposes of Buyers
diligence.

(e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall, at its sole cost
and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Companies), (i) repair all damage done to the Assets (including
the real property and other assets associated therewith) caused by Buyers or
any of its Representatives due diligence and (ii) remove all equipment, tools
or other property brought onto the Assets in connection with such due
diligence. Any disturbance to the Assets (including the real property
and other assets associated therewith) resulting from the due diligence
investigation conducted by or on behalf of Buyer shall be promptly corrected
by Buyer as provided for above.

 



10

    

(f) During all periods prior to the Closing that Buyer or any of its
Representatives are on the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense
and with insurers reasonably satisfactory to Seller (or the applicable Third
Party operator, as applicable), policies of insurance of types and in amounts
sufficient to cover the obligations and liabilities of Buyer under this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Coverage under all insurance required to be carried by
Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(f)_ shall (i) be primary insurance, (ii)
list the Seller Group as additional insureds, (iii) waive subrogation against
the Seller Group and (iv) provide for not less than five days prior notice to
Seller in the event of cancellation or modification of the policy or reduction
in coverage. Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such
insurance to Seller prior to entering the lands underlying the Assets.

3.4  _Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of
access to the Records and/or the Assets, Buyer shall become privy to
confidential and other information of Seller and the Companies and that such
information shall until the Closing occurs be held confidential by Buyer and
its Representatives in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement as if each had been a party to the Confidentiality Agreement (if not
already a party thereto).

aggregate amount of all Claims asserted by Buyer under _Section_ __ _
4.2(a)_, __ that are in excess of the Threshold Amount does not exceed the
Indemnity Deductible, and then only to the extent such Claims exceed the
Indemnity Deductible; and

 

(c) any Claims asserted by Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_ to the extent
exceeding, in the aggregate, 15% of the unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



14

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations described above in  _Section_
__ _ 4.4(a)-(c)_ shall not apply to any Claim under _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)
_for breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.4, Section_ __ _ 7.32,
Section_ __ _ 7.33 _or _Section_ __ _ 7.37_; _provided_ that Sellers total
liability for all Claims asserted by Buyer under this Agreement, including
for a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations, shall not exceed 100%
of the unadjusted Purchase Price.

4.5  _Notice of Claims_. All claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Indemnifying Party_ " when
used in connection with particular Claims shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify another Party or Person(s) with respect to such Claims
pursuant to this Agreement, and the term " _Indemnified Party_ " when used in
connection with particular Claims shall mean the Party or Person(s) having the
right to be indemnified with respect to such Claims by another Party pursuant
to this Agreement.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, an Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this _Section_
__ _ 4.5_, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure
of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent (and then only to such
extent) such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit
the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party on or before the 30th day after its receipt of the
Claim Notice may notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party
admits or denies its liability to indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during
such 30-day period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party on whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have denied such liability.

 



15

    

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, such Third
Party Claim subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section_ __ _
4.5(d)_, _provided _ that, any such Indemnifying Party may reserve the right
to simultaneously dispute whether it is required to indemnify such Third Party
Claim pursuant to this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, at its own expense, but subject to the
Indemnifying Partys full control of, any defense or settlement of any Third
Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 4.5(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not
be required to bring any counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person.
An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto that does not include an unconditional
written release of the Indemnified Party from all Claims in respect of such
Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially
and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim, initially assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim but is later
determined (whether by agreement with the Indemnified Party or through
resolution of a dispute over liability) to be not responsible for such
indemnification obligation, or assumes the defense but fails to
diligently prosecute or settle such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of its choosing,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or
final determination thereof. Any settlement of the Third Party Claim by the
Indemnified Party shall require the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the
settlement is solely for money damages and results in a final resolution.

 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party on or before the 30th day after its receipt of
the Claim Notice may (i) cure the Claims complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Claim or (iii) dispute the claim for such Claims. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
30-day period that it has cured the Claims or that it disputes the claim for
such Claims, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to dispute its
liability for such Claims.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the above, the control and conduct of any Tax Audit that
is a Third Party Claim shall be governed by  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(i)_.

4.6 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. NO MEMBER OF THE BUYER GROUP OR SELLER GROUP
SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM SELLER OR BUYER (RESPECTIVELY), OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT (a) ANY DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS ARE DETERMINED BY A
COURT TO BE DIRECT DAMAGES OR (b) ANY SUCH PARTY IS LIABLE TO PAY ANY

DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING
AGAINST SUCH DAMAGES) SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED BY THIS PROVISION AS TO RECOVERY
HEREUNDER. SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, AND EXCEPTING THE DAMAGES
DESCRIBED IN SUBPOINTS (a) AND (b) IN SUCH SENTENCE, BUYER, ON BEHALF OF EACH
MEMBER OF THE BUYER GROUP, AND SELLER, ON BEHALF OF EACH MEMBER OF THE SELLER
GROUP, WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (OTHER THAN
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS THAT ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT TO BE DIRECT
DAMAGES) ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

other members of the Buyer Group) releases, remises and forever discharges
Seller and its Affiliates and all of the other members of the Seller Group
from any and all Claims at Law or in equity, known or unknown, that any member

3.3(c)_, THE INDEMNIFICATION, RELEASE, WAIVER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT
THE CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE
OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR
VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS

4.9 _Waiver of Right of Rescission_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
subject to any express rights the Parties may have hereunder to seek and
obtain specific performance or other equitable remedies, following Closing,
the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be
adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As such,
Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.10 _Insurance_ ; _Mitigation_. The amount of any Claims for which any
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be reduced by any corresponding insurance proceeds, from
insurance policies carried by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, that
are realized by such Indemnified Party from Third Party insurers with respect
to such Claims; _provided_ , __ that the Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments related to such Claims. If any Indemnified
Party receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar
payments after the settlement of any indemnification claim under _Section_ __
_ 4.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.3_, __ as applicable, such Indemnified Party
shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or similar payments, up to the amount received in
connection with such indemnification claim. It is the intention of the Parties
that no insurer or Third Party shall be entitled to any benefit or right it
would not be entitled to receive in the absence of this subsection. For the
avoidance of doubt, in connection with any breach of the representations of
Seller in _Section_ __ _ 7.24(a_) _,_ Buyer shall be required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Liabilities resulting from
such breach, including by rerouting any affected Hydrocarbons on other
portions of the Gathering System with available capacity where it is
commercially reasonable for Buyer to do so.

Buyers remedies, as expressly set forth in _Article_ __ _ 4_ and this
_Article_ __ _ 5_, except with respect to _Section_ __ _ 7.18_, _Section_ __
_ 7.19_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.32_, _Section_ __ _ 7.37_, _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(xii)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(xix)_ __ (a) Seller makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Companies title to any of the Oil and Gas Properties, (b) Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except with respect to any Fraud by any
member of the Seller Group or any Claim for breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.18_,

_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)(xii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(xix)_, Buyers sole and exclusive
remedy for any defect in title or any other title matter (including any Title
Defect with respect to any of the Oil and Gas Properties or otherwise) shall
be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and (c) Buyer hereby expressly waives
any and all other rights or remedies with respect thereto.

5.2 _Title Defects_.

 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. On or before the Title Defect Claim Date, Buyer
may deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ (collectively, the " _Title_ __ _ Defect Notices_,"
and each individually, a " _Title_ __ _ Defect Notice_") setting forth any
matters that, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects. Except
with respect to a Claim for breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.18_, _Section_ __ _
7.19_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.32_, _Section_ __ _ 7.37_, _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(xii)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(xix)_, for all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived, and none of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any other member of
the Seller Group shall have any Liability for any Title Defect or any other
title matter related to the Oil and Gas Properties that Buyer fails to
properly assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Seller
on or before the Title Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect
Notice shall be in writing and shall include: (i) a description of the alleged
Title Defect(s), (ii) the Assets affected by the alleged Title
Defect(s) (each a " _Title_ __ _ Defect Property_"), (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller to identify the basis of the alleged Title Defect(s) and
(v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations (in reasonable detail) upon which Buyers belief is based. To
give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing any Title Defects,
Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller weekly
written notices of all alleged Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding weekly period after the Execution Date and prior to delivery of such
notice, which notice may be supplemented on or prior to the Title Defect Claim
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers right to assert a Title Defect
shall not be prejudiced by any failure to provide such advance notice.

(b) _Title_ __ _ Benefit Notices_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Defect Claim Date a
notice meeting the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ (collectively,

_ Benefit Notice_") setting forth any matters that, in Sellers
reasonable opinion, constitute Title Benefits. To be effective, each Title
Benefit Notice shall be in writing and shall include: (i) a description of the

 



21

    

 alleged Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Assets affected by the Title Benefit(s)
(each a " _Title_ __ _ Benefit Property_"), (iii) the Allocated Value of
each Title Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents available to Seller
reasonably necessary for Buyer to identify the basis of the alleged Title
Benefit(s) and (v) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is increased by the alleged
Title Benefit(s) and the computations (in reasonable detail) upon which
Sellers belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived, and Buyer
shall not have any Liability for, any Title Benefit that Seller fails to
assert as a Title Benefit by a Title Benefit Notice received by Buyer on or
before the Title Defect Claim Date. For clarity, Seller shall not be entitled
to a Title Benefit or any remedies with respect to a Title Benefit Amount with
respect to any Asset for which the Allocated Value is $0.

 

(c) _Seller_ __ _s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to the
120th day after the Title Defect Claim Date (the " _Title_ __ _ Cure
Period_"), any Title Defects of which it has timely received a Title Defect
Notice from Buyer. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of
the Title Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford (and cause the Upstream Company
to afford), at no cost to Buyer, any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, Seller and its officers, employees and other authorized
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
Records in Buyers or any of its Affiliates possession or control, together
with a right to copy such Records at Sellers sole cost, in order to
facilitate Sellers attempt to cure any such Title Defects.

 

(d) _Remedies for Title_ __ _ Defects_. Subject to (i) Sellers continuing
right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect
Amount asserted with respect thereto, (ii) the rights of Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(d)_, (iii) _ Section_ __ _ 5.2(h)_, and (iv) Sellers
cure rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, if any Title Defect properly
asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ is not waived in
writing by Buyer prior to the Closing, then at the Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.2(f)_ as being the value of such Title Defect to the extent affecting the
applicable Title Defect Property (the " _Title_ __ _ Defect Amount_").

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. If any Title Benefits are timely asserted
for a Well or Future Well by Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_, then the applicable Title Benefit Amount shall be applied as set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(h)_. Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for any Title Benefit or other title
benefit shall be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and Seller hereby
expressly waives any and all other rights or remedies with respect thereto.

(f) _Title Defect Amount_. The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title
Defect shall be the amount by which the aggregate Allocated Values of the
affected Title Defect Property(ies) is reduced as a result of the existence of
such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following
terms and conditions:

(i) if Seller and Buyer agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



22

    

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property up to the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property(ies);

 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in the Net Revenue Interest
for the Target Formation of any Title Defect Property from the Net Revenue
Interest set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-3_ , as
applicable, for such Title Defect Property, and the Working Interest for
the Target Formation of such Title Defect Property is reduced
proportionately, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, multiplied by a fraction, (A)
the numerator of which is the amount of such Net Revenue Interest decrease
and (B) the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for
such Title Defect Property in  _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit_ __ _ A_
_-3_ , as applicable; _provided_ that if the Title Defect does not affect the
Title Defect Property throughout the entire life of such Title Defect
Property, then the Title Defect Amount determined under this _Section_ __ _
5.2(f)(iii) _shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title affecting the Title Defect Property of a type not described
above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ __ _ 5_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

 

(g) _Title_ __ _ Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a
Title Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following
methodology, terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in the Net Revenue Interest
for any Title Benefit Property such that the actual Net Revenue Interest for
the Target Formation of any Title Benefit Property is greater than the Net
Revenue Interest set forth in  _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit_ __ _ A_
_-3_ , as applicable, for such Title Benefit Property, and the Working
Interest is unchanged or increased proportionately, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property, multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the amount
of such Net Revenue Interest increase and (B) the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest set forth for such

 



23

    

 Title Benefit Property in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-3_
, as applicable; _provided_ that if the Title Benefit does not affect the
Title Benefit Property throughout the entire life of such Title Benefit
Property, then the Title Benefit Amount determined under this _Section_ __ _
5.2(g)(ii) _shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only; and

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

(h) _Individual Title Threshold and Defect Deductible_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price or any other remedy provided by Seller hereunder for any
individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount applicable thereto
does not exceed the lesser of (x) $100,000 and (y) 50% of the aggregate
Allocated Values of the affected Title Defect Properties (the " _Individual
Title_ __ _ Threshold_") and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments
to the Purchase Price or any other remedy provided by Seller hereunder for any
Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount applicable thereto exceeds the
Individual Title Threshold until (A) Title Defect Amounts of all such Title
Defects that exceed the Individual Title Threshold, in the aggregate
(excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by
Seller during the Title Cure Period),  _less_ all Title Benefit Amounts that
exceed the Individual Title Threshold, exceeds (B) the Title Defect
Deductible, at which point Buyer shall only be entitled to remedies hereunder
with respect to such amounts in excess of the Title Defect Deductible.

(i) _Title Disputes_.

 

(i) The Parties shall attempt, in good faith, to reach agreement on the
existence of each Title Defect and Title Benefit, the value of each Title
Defect and Title Benefit and the proper assertion of each Title Defect and
Title Benefit by Title Defect Notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ or Title Benefit Notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_,
as applicable, prior to the Closing and on the adequacy of any cure of any
Title Defect prior to the expiration of the Title Cure Period (collectively "
_Title_ __ _ Disputes_"). If Seller and Buyer do not agree on any Title
Dispute prior to such period, either Party shall have the right to elect,
after the expiration of such period and upon written notice to the other
Party, to initiate formal dispute resolution to resolve such Title Dispute(s)
as are specified in such notice (collectively " _Referred Title_ __ _
Disputes_"). All Referred Title Disputes shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(i)_. There shall be a single
moderator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten years experience
in oil and gas titles involving properties in the state of Arkansas (the "
_Title_ __ _ Referee_"). The Title Referee shall not have worked as an
employee or outside counsel for either Party or its Affiliates during the
10-year period preceding the Effective Time or have any financial interest in
the dispute or any other interest, position or relationship that would or
might conflict with the proper performance of his or her duties as Title
Referee. The Title Referee shall be selected by mutual agreement of Seller and

 



24

    

 Buyer on or before the 15th day after the election of a Party to utilize the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(i)_ with respect to a Referred Title
Dispute, _provided _ that, in the event the Parties are unable to mutually
agree upon the Title Referee within such time period, then either Party may
petition the Houston, Texas office of the AAA to select the Title Referee. In
connection with the engagement of the Title Referee, each Party shall execute
such engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the Title Referee shall
require as a condition to such engagement. Each Party shall submit in writing
to the Title Referee, with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single
written statement of its position on each Title Defect and Title Benefit
subject to a Title Dispute, the Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount,
the compliance of Title Benefit Notice or Title Defect Notice with the
requirements hereof or the adequacy of any cure of any Title Defect (each "
_Title_ __ _ Dispute Position_") together with a copy of this Agreement and
any supporting material that such Party desires to furnish not later than the
fifth Business Day after appointment of the Title Referee; _provided_ that
(except with respect to Buyers dispute of the adequacy of the cure of any
Title Defect) Buyers Title Dispute Position shall be limited to only those
positions identified in Buyers original Title Defect Notice. The Title
Referees determination shall be made on or before the 30th day
after submission of Referred Title Disputes and shall be final and binding
upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his or her
determination, the Title Referee shall be bound by the rules set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ as applicable, and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Referee are
necessary to make a proper determination; _provided_ that the determination
will be made solely on the Title Dispute Positions without any additional or
supplemental submittals by either Party. Title Referee shall render a decision
by choosing either Sellers or Buyers Title Dispute Position with respect to
each Referred Title Dispute, based on the materials described above that it
deems the most closely conforms to the requirements of this Agreement. Each
Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case to the Title Referee and shall each bear one half of the costs and
expenses of the Title Referee. Buyer, with respect to Title Defects, and
Seller, with respect to Title Benefits, shall be deemed to have conclusively
waived any unresolved Title Defect, or cure thereof, or any unresolved Title
Benefit which is not submitted for resolution as a Referred Title Dispute as
provided in this Section on or before the 120th day after the end of the Title
Cure Period.

(ii) To the extent that the award of the Title Referee with respect to any
Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 2_, then on or
before the tenth Business Day after the Title Referee delivers written notice
to Buyer and Seller of its award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a
Title Benefit Amount and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(i)_, (A) Buyer shall
pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Referee to Seller
and (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title
Referee to Buyer.

(iii) Nothing herein shall operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on
account of any Title Dispute resolution hereunder and to the extent any
adjustments for Title Defect validly submitted prior to the Closing are not
agreed upon by the Parties as of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted therefor as of the Closing based on Buyers good faith estimate for
the same and subsequent adjustments thereto, if any, will be made pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(i)_.

 



25

    

5.3 _Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) _Environmental Defect Notices_. On or before the Environmental Defect
Claim Date, Buyer may deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the
requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ (collectively, the "
_Environmental Defect Notices_ ," and each individually, an " _Environmental
Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters that, in Buyers reasonable
opinion, constitute Environmental Defects. Except with respect to a Claim for
the Retained Liabilities or a breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.5, Section_ __ _
7.7,_  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_, _Section_ __ _ 7.22, Section_ __ _ 7.26 and
Section_ __ _ 7.27 _for all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and
none of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any other member of the Seller
Group shall have any Liability for, any Environmental Defect or any other
environmental matter that Buyer fails to properly assert as an Environmental
Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the
Environmental Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing and shall include: (i) a description of the
matter constituting the alleged Environmental Defect (including the relevant
Environmental Law implicated thereby), (ii) the Assets affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect(s) (each an " _Environmental Defect Property_ "), (iii)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to identify the basis of
the alleged Environmental Defect(s) and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation
Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is attributable
to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyers calculation of the Remediation
Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice should describe in
reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the asserted Environmental
Defect and identify any significant assumptions used by Buyer in calculating
the Remediation Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met
to comply with Environmental Laws. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing any Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller written notices of all alleged
Environmental Defects within ten (10) days of Buyers receipt of written
notice confirming the existence of an Environmental Defect and prior to
delivery of such notice, which notice may be supplemented on or prior to the
Environmental Defect Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers right
to assert an Environmental Defect shall not be prejudiced by any failure to
provide such advance notice. Seller shall at its sole discretion have the
right, but not the obligation, to Remediate at Sellers sole cost any claimed
Environmental Defect during the Environmental Cure Period.

 

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to (x) Sellers continuing
right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the
Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, (y) the rights of Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(d)_, and (z) _ Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, if
any Environmental Defect properly asserted by Buyer in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or Remediated prior
to Closing (the " _Environmental Cure Period_ "), then at Closing, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Remediation Amount attributable to
such Environmental Defect.

 



26

    

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for any Fraud by any member of the Seller
Group, Buyers right to terminate this Agreement, Buyers remedies under
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(c)_ for Retained Liabilities or under _Section_ __ _
4.2(a) _for the breach of Sellers representations in  _Section_ __ _ 7.5,
Section_ __ _ 7.7,_ _Section_ __ _ 7.8_, _Section_ __ _ 7.22, Section_ __ _
7.26 and Section_ __ _ 7.27_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ shall be the
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect
or other environmental matter.

 

(d) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount relating thereto is less
than or equal to $100,000 (the " _Individual Environmental Threshold_ ") and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount(s) relating thereto
exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless the sum of the
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate, exceed the Environmental Defect
Deductible, at which point Buyer shall only be entitled to remedies hereunder
with respect to such amounts in excess of the Environmental Defect Deductible.

 

(e) _Environmental Defect Dispute_.

 

(i) The Parties shall attempt, in good faith, to reach agreement regarding the
existence of, nature of, or cost or adequacy of Remediation associated with
any asserted Environmental Defect prior to the Closing Date or the proper
assertion thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_. If Seller and
Buyer have not agreed on or before the Closing Date about the existence of an
Environmental Defect or the cost or adequacy of Remediation associated with
the asserted Environmental Defect or its proper assertion, then either Party
shall have the right, after Closing and upon written notice to the other
Party, to initiate formal dispute resolution to resolve such matters
(collectively " _Environmental Disputes_ ") as are specified in such notice.
All Environmental Disputes shall be exclusively and finally resolved
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_. There shall be a single moderator,
who shall be a reputable environmental consultant or engineer with at least
fifteen years experience in remedial and corrective environmental action
regarding oil and gas properties (the " _Environmental Referee_ "). The
Environmental Referee shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for
either Party or its Affiliates during the 10-year period preceding the
Effective Time or have any financial interest in the dispute or any other
interest, position or relationship that would or might conflict with the
proper performance of his or her duties as Environmental Referee.
The Environmental Referee shall be selected by mutual agreement of Seller and
Buyer on or before the 15th day after the election of a Party to utilize the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ with respect to an
alleged Environmental Defect, _provided_ that, in the event the Parties are
unable to mutually agree upon the Environmental Referee within such time
period, then either Party may petition the Houston, Texas office of the AAA to
select the Environmental Referee. In connection with the engagement of the
Environmental Referee, each Party shall execute such engagement, indemnity and
other agreements as the Environmental Referee shall require as a condition to
such engagement. Each Party shall submit in writing to the Environmental
Referee with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single written
statement of its position on existence of the Environmental Defect and/or the
cost or adequacy of Remediation associated with the asserted Environmental
Dispute or the compliance of the Environmental Defect Notice with the
requirements hereof (each

 



27

    

 " _Environmental Dispute Position_ "), together with a copy of this
Agreement and any supporting material that such Party desires to furnish not
later than the fifth Business Day after appointment of the Environmental
Referee, _provided_ that (except with respect to Buyers dispute of the
adequacy of the cure of any Environmental Defect) Buyers Environmental
Dispute Position shall be limited to only those positions identified in
Buyers original Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Referees
determination, as applicable, shall be made on or before the 30th day after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the
Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determinations, the
Environmental Referee shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.3_ and may consider such other matters as, in the opinion of
the Environmental Referee, are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination; _provided_ that the determination will be made solely on the
Environmental Dispute Positions without any additional or supplemental
submittals by either Party. The Environmental Referee may consult with and
engage disinterested third persons to advise the Environmental Referee,
including other environmental consultants. Environmental Referee shall render
a decision choosing either Sellers or Buyers Environmental Dispute Position
with respect to each Environmental Dispute, based on the materials described
above that it deems the most closely conforms to the requirements of this
Agreement. The Environmental Referee may not award damages (except as
represented by the value of an Environmental Defect), interest, or penalties
to any Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its respective case and shall each
bear one half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Referee. Buyer
and Seller shall be deemed to have conclusively waived any unresolved
Environmental Defects or cure thereof which is not submitted for resolution as
an Environmental Dispute as provided in this Section on or before the 120th
day after the Closing.

(ii) To the extent that the award of the Environmental Referee with respect
to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 2_, then on or before the tenth
Business Day after the Environmental Referee delivers written notice to Buyer
and Seller of his award with respect to a Remediation Amount and subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, (A) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so
awarded by the Environmental Referee to Seller and (B) Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Referee to Buyer.

(iii) Nothing herein shall operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on
account of any Environmental Dispute resolution hereunder and to the extent
any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of the Closing, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted therefor as of the Closing based on Buyers
good faith estimate for the same and subsequent adjustments thereto, if any,
will be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_.

 

(f) _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development, production, gathering and
transportation of oil and gas and there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or
attach itself

 



28

    

 to the inside of wells, pipelines, materials and equipment as scale, or in
other forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or
included in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous
Substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous
Substances may have come in contact with various environmental media,
including water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for
the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances
from the Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, NORM or asbestos containing
materials shall not constitute the basis of an Environmental Defect or the
basis of any breach of the representations contained in _Section_ __ _ 7.5,
Section_ __ _ 7.7,_ _Section_ __ _ 7.8_, _Section_ __ _ 7.22, Section_ __
_ 7.26 and Section_ __ _ 7.27_, except to the extent that Remediation of
such NORM or asbestos containing materials is currently required under
Environmental Laws.

foreign limited liability company and is in good standing in all jurisdictions

or violate any Order applicable to Buyer as a party in interest, except in

any applicable state "blue sky" Laws or other applicable Securities Laws.
Buyer is an accredited investor (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended). Buyer has
evaluated, independently and without reliance on Seller (except to the extent

Agreement), the merits and risks of an investment in the Interests, any
Company and the Assets for the purpose of acquiring the Interests, and Buyer
has had reasonable and sufficient access to documents, other information and
materials as it considers appropriate to make its evaluations. Buyer
acknowledges that the Interests are not registered pursuant to the Securities

matters to be capable of evaluating such investment in the Interests.

Buyers Knowledge, threatened against Buyer, any of its properties or any of
Buyers directors, officers or employees (in their capacity as such), that, if

material adverse effect on Buyers ability to consummate the transaction

notify Buyer promptly after taking any such action.

of the Assets with respect to which none of Seller, the Companies and their
Affiliates is the operator, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the
other working interest owners (including the operators) who are not Seller,
Companies or their Affiliates shall not constitute a breach of the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ by Seller, nor shall any action required by a

of this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_.

 

(f) With respect to any AFE or similar request received by Seller that is

shall forward such AFE to Buyer as soon as is reasonably practicable and
thereafter the Parties shall consult with each other regarding whether or not
the applicable Company should elect to participate in such operation. Buyer
agrees that it will (i) timely respond to any written request for consent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1 _and (ii) consent to any written request
for approval of any AFE or similar request that Buyer reasonably considers to
be economically appropriate. In the event the Parties do not agree on or
before the fifteenth Business Day (unless a shorter time is
reasonably required by the circumstances or the applicable joint operating
agreement) of Buyers receipt of any consent request as to whether or not the
applicable Company should elect to participate in such operation, and for all
AFEs and other operations estimated to cost less than $250,000 (net to
Sellers or any Companies interest in the Assets), Buyers decision shall
control and such operation shall be deemed to have not been consented to by
Buyer.

 

9.2 _Names_. As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing, but in no event
later than (a) the tenth (10th) Business Day after Closing, Buyer shall change
the name of the Companies to remove the names and other identifying marks of
Seller and its Affiliates, including " _Southwestern_ " and " _SWN_ ", but
excluding " _DeSoto_ ", and (b) the one hundred twentieth (120th)

 



49

    

 day after Closing, Buyer shall remove " _Southwestern_ " and " _SWN_ " or
other similar marks and any other related trademark, design or logo previously
or currently used by any Company or any of its Affiliates, but excluding "
_DeSoto_ ", from all of the Assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement,
including all buildings, signs and vehicles of such Company and cease using
such mark in electronic databases, web sites, product instructions, packaging
and other materials, printed or otherwise and otherwise cease making use of
the word " _Southwestern_ " or " _SWN_ " for any purpose, but excluding "
_DeSoto_ ". As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing, Buyer shall make
the requisite filings with, and provide the requisite notices to, the
appropriate Governmental Authorities to accomplish the foregoing and to place
the title or other indicia of ownership of the Assets in a name other than
any name of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any variations thereof. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller is the owner of the " _Southwestern_ "
and " _SWN_ " names and marks and all goodwill attached thereto, which are
Excluded Assets, and Seller acknowledges that the Midstream Company Interests
include any rights of the Midstream Company in the name " _DeSoto_."

 

9.3 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Seller Consolidated Returns (including in each such Seller
Consolidated Return, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all items and
activities of the Companies through and including the Closing Date), and
shall pay all Taxes owed with respect to such Seller Consolidated Returns.

(b) Seller shall be responsible for filing or causing to be filed with the
applicable taxing authorities each Tax Return of the Companies (other than any
Seller Consolidated Return) that is required to be filed on or before the
Closing Date and paying or causing to be paid the Taxes reflected on such Tax
Returns as due and owing.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer
shall be responsible for filing with the applicable taxing authorities each
Tax Return with respect to Asset Taxes and Non-Asset Taxes of the Companies
that is required to be filed after the Closing Date for any Tax period that
ends before or includes the Closing Date, and paying the Taxes reflected on
such Tax Returns as due and owing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that Seller is required by applicable Law to file with the applicable
Governmental Authority any such Tax Return and pay the Taxes reflected on such
Tax Return, Seller shall file each such Tax Return on or prior to the due date
therefor as prepared by Buyer, taking into account any reasonable
comments Seller may have, and shall pay all Taxes reflected on such Tax
Returns as due and owing.

(d) Seller shall be allocated and shall bear all Asset Taxes for any Tax
period ending prior to the Effective Time and for the portion of any Current
Tax Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be
allocated and shall bear all Asset Taxes for any Tax period beginning after
the Effective Time and for the portion of any Current Tax Period beginning at
the Effective Time (ignoring, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d)_
that such Asset Taxes may be imposed on the Companies rather than on
the Parties directly). For purposes of the foregoing:

(i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production
of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause_ __ _
(iii)_) shall be apportioned between the Parties based on the number of units
actually produced before, on or after the Effective Time.

 



50

    

(ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to sales or receipts
or imposed on a transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in
_clause_ __ _ (i)_ or _(iii)_ ) shall be allocated to the period in which the
transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred.

 

(iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis pertaining to a Current Tax Period shall be allocated
between the portion of such Current Tax Period ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the portion of such Current Tax Period beginning at the
Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days
in the applicable Current Tax Period that occur before the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such Current
Tax Period that occur on or after the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
on the other hand.

(e) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Tax pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.3_, _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, as applicable, the
Parties shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the
amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the
actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically
borne by a Party) is ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if
any) that was taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, timely payments will be made from
one Party to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the
amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under _Section_ __ _
9.3(d)_.

(f) Seller shall be allocated and shall bear all Non-Asset Taxes for any Tax
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the portion of any Current
Tax Period ending on the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be allocated and shall
bear all Non-Asset Taxes for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date
and the portion of any Current Tax Period beginning immediately after the
Closing Date. For purposes of the foregoing, in the case of any Non-Asset
Taxes that are payable with respect to any Current Tax Period, the portion of
any such Non-Asset Taxes that is attributable to the portion of such Current
Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be the amount that would be
payable if the Current Tax Period ended with (and included) the Closing Date;
provided, however, that with respect to any Arkansas franchise tax or any
other Non-Asset Tax imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets or
capital of any Company, the portion of such Non-Asset Taxes that is
attributable to the portion of such Current Tax Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Current Tax
Period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of Current Tax Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Current Tax Period.

 



51

    

(g) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on
or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of any Company. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return or Tax proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

(h) The amount of any refunds or credits of (i) Asset Taxes for any taxable
period ending prior to the Effective Time and for the portion of any Current
Tax Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) Non-Asset
Taxes and Income Taxes (other than Income Taxes that are Non-Asset Taxes)for
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for the portion
of any Current Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall, in each case, be
for the account of Seller. The amount of any refunds or credits of (x) Asset
Taxes for any taxable period beginning at or after the Effective Time or the
portion of any Current Tax Period beginning at the Effective Time, and (y)
Non-Asset Taxes and Income Taxes (other than Income Taxes that are Non-Asset
Taxes)for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and for the
portion of any Current Tax Period beginning immediately after the Closing
Date shall, in each case, be for the account of Buyer. The amount of any
refunds or credits of any such Taxes for any Current Tax Period shall be
equitably apportioned between Buyer and Seller in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d) _or _9.3(f)_ , as applicable.
Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the
Party entitled to receive a refund or credit of Tax pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(h)_ the amount of such refund or credit on or before the
30th day after such refund is received or such credit is recognized, in each
case, net of any costs or expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates
in procuring such refund or credit. Buyer shall take all necessary actions, or
cause each Company to take all necessary actions, as are commercially
reasonable, to obtain any such refunds or credits of Taxes of such Company
for the account of Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(h)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, any refund of Taxes allocable to Seller under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(h)_ received by Buyer or the Companies in the form of a
credit against future Taxes shall be for the account of Seller.

(i) After the Closing, except as otherwise provided in the Joint Defense
Agreement, Buyer shall control the conduct of any audit, adjustment, claim,
examination, assessment, contest, or other proceeding with respect to Asset
Taxes and Non-Asset Taxes of the Companies (each a " _Tax Audit_ "). In the
case of a Tax Audit that relates to, or could reasonably be expected to give
rise to, Seller Taxes, Seller, at its election, may control the conduct of
such Tax Audit, and Seller shall not settle, compromise or concede any
portion of such Tax Audit that is reasonably likely to affect Taxes of any
Company for any Current Tax Period or any taxable year beginning at or after
the Effective Time, or after the Closing Date, as applicable, without the
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. In the case of a Tax Audit that relates to, or could reasonably
be expected to give rise to, Seller Taxes and that Seller does not elect to
control, (i) Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax Audit, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct such Tax Audit in a manner that is
not likely to affect Seller Taxes, and shall not settle, compromise or
concede any portion of such Tax Audit that is likely to affect Seller Taxes
without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (ii) Seller shall reimburse Buyer within
5 days after Buyers request therefor, for the product of (A) the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in conducting any such Tax
Audit _multiplied by_  (B) the percentage that the amount of Seller Taxes at
issue in such Tax Audit bears to the total amount of Taxes at issue in such
Tax Audit.

 



52

    

(j) The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.5_, _Article_ __ _ 4_, _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
unless otherwise required by Law.

(k) Transfer Taxes (if any) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby will be borne one-half by Buyer and one-
half by Seller. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

(l) Buyer and Seller agree that any of Seller and Buyer may elect, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, to treat the acquisition or sale of the
Interests, which, for U.S. federal income tax purposes is treated as the
acquisition or sale of the assets of the Companies, as an exchange of like-
kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an " _Exchange_ "); _provided_
that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of the Exchange. Each Party
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other
Party in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to
the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or
Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Seller and Buyer shall
have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a part of its
rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an
exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal
Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a Partys rights under
this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any other Person in
connection with the Exchange shall release any Party from, or modify, any of
its Liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each
other) under this Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any
particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of
such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange.
Any Party electing to treat the deemed acquisition or sale of the assets of
the Companies as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs
incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the
cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall
agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold
the other Party, their Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
liabilities and Taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the

9.4 _Amendment to_ _Schedules_. Seller shall have the right, exercisable until

with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered that, if existing
or known at the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be
set forth or described in such Schedules (each, a " _Schedule_ __ _
Update_"). For the purposes of determining whether Buyer has the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b) _or _Section_ __
_ 12.1(d) _and for purposes of the Buyer Indemnified Parties rights to
indemnification under _Article 4_ , such 

 



53

    

 Schedule Update shall not be deemed to cure any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement, _provided_ that, to the
extent that Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(b) _or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(d) _as a result of such
Schedule Update and Buyer does not exercise such right, and the Schedule
Update pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ relates to any matter first
arising or known after the Execution Date, then such Schedule Update shall be
deemed to cure any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement for all purposes hereunder.

the Companies. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and
expense, shall deliver to Seller evidence of the posting of replacements for
all bonds, letters of credit and guaranties set forth on _Schedule 9.6_ to
the extent such replacements are necessary to permit the cancellation of the
bonds, letters of credit and guaranties posted by Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Companies) set forth on _Schedule 9.6_. From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against
any and all Liabilities arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from Buyers failure to replace such bonds, letters of credit and
guaranties in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.6 _and have all __
bonds, letters of credit and guaranties set forth on _Schedule 9.6_ posted by

copies of any or all Records subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.21_, and (b) may
retain all Records (other than Records with respect to Tax matters) to the
extent associated with any Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall not be liable for any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ in the
event that it fails to furnish to Buyer any emails or any Records that are not
material or necessary to the current conduct of the Business and that require
unreasonable burden on Seller to produce, _provided, further, that_ at any
point during the term of

 



54

    

 the Transition Services Agreement, upon request, Buyer shall be granted
access to all such (i) emails sent to or from any Transferred Employee to the
extent reasonably necessary to defend or prosecute any Third Party litigation
arising prior to the two year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii)
Records that were retained by Seller, and in each case, to the extent that
such emails and Records are in Sellers possession at the time of such
request and do not create an undue burden on Seller to provide. Buyer shall
maintain the Records that it acquires for a period of seven years after
Closing and shall afford Seller reasonable access at Sellers sole cost
and expense to such Records as reasonably requested by Seller.

Transferred Escrow Accounts.

 

9.13 _Continuing Indemnification for Company Actors_. From the Closing Date
until the six (6) year anniversary date of the Effective Time, Buyer shall,
and shall cause each Company to not amend, repeal or modify any of the
obligations of each Company for indemnification and advancement of expenses in
favor of each past and present holder of any Interest (including the
ultimate beneficial owner or any Affiliate of an ultimate beneficial owner of
interests), agent or other Representative, director, officer and manager of
any Company (each, a " _Company Indemnitee_ ") under the applicable
Governing Documents of each Company (in effect as of the Execution Date), any
indemnification agreements between any Company and any Company Indemnitee and
any resolution of any Company or its managers or members in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such Company Indemnitee.

(a) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Company Indemnitee or insured
Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution of, any other right to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. From the

9.14 _Equitable and Other Remedies_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.2_, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the rights of each Party hereunder are
special, unique and of extraordinary character, that the non-breaching Party
or Parties would be irreparably and immediately harmed and would not have any
adequate remedy at Law in the event that any provisions of this Agreement are
not performed by the other Party or Parties or its or their Affiliates (as
applicable) strictly in accordance with their respective terms or are
otherwise breached, and it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in each
case, in accordance with the terms hereof. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (a) either Party has an
adequate remedy at Law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Each Party further agrees
that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with, or as a condition to, obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.14_, and each Party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN
THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 9.14_, THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.14_ SHALL ONLY APPLY TO
THE COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES TO BE PERFORMED AFTER THE CLOSING,
THE COVENANTS TO BE PERFORMED UNDER SECTIONS 3.4, 12.3 AND 13.9, AND THOSE
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REMEDIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.2. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 12.2_, such remedy shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedy for such breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition
to all of the remedies at Law or in equity available to the non-breaching
Party or Parties, subject, however, in each case, to  _Section_ __ _ 4.6_.

9.15 _Seller-Transferred Assets_. Prior to the Scheduled Closing Date, Seller
(at its sole cost and expense) shall cause, all Target Leases and Wells,
Records, Personal Property, Field Offices, Vehicles, Seismic Data, and, as of
the Closing Date, any unpaid Advanced JIB Receivables owned by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Excluded Assets) to be conveyed to the Upstream
Company (either the applicable asset or the lease rights thereto, as
applicable), pursuant to the Contributed Assets Assignment, and all of such __
assets shall constitute "Assets" for all purposes of this Agreement.

Arkansas Business Employees to whom Buyer or its Affiliate has made an offer

Designated Arkansas Business Employee who is not actively employed due to

shall be (A) contingent on the circumstances being such that Seller or
an Affiliate thereof would have been required to re-employ or continue to
employ such Inactive Designated Arkansas Business Employee in accordance with
its applicable policies, practices and procedures in effect on the date
hereof, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not occurred,
and (B) for employment effective as of such date on which the applicable
Inactive Designated Arkansas Business Employee returns from a leave of absence
(so long as such return occurs within 90 days after the Closing Date or such
later time as may be required by applicable Law). Buyer shall provide Seller,
in writing, within ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, a list of
those Designated Arkansas Business Employees who have accepted Buyers offer
of employment and those Designated Arkansas Business Employees who have not
successfully passed Buyers or its Affiliates applicable pre-employment
screening requirements. Buyer shall update such list and provide such updated
list to Seller on the day before the Closing and, if additional changes occur,
on the Closing Date.

 

(ii) On or before October 31, 2018, Buyer or its Affiliates shall make all
offers and shall provide Seller, in writing, a list of those Office Business
Employees to whom Buyer or its Affiliate has made an offer of employment
(collectively, the " _Designated Office Business Employees_ " and, together
with the Designated Arkansas Business Employees, the " _Designated Business
Employees_ "). Such offers shall be for employment to be effective as of 12:01
a.m. on the day immediately following the last day services are provided by
the applicable Designated Office Business Employee pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each
Designated Office Business Employee who is not actively employed due to an
approved leave of absence as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (each,
an " _Inactive Designated Office Business Employee_ "), such offers shall be
(A) contingent on the circumstances being such that Seller or an Affiliate
thereof would have been required to re-employ or continue to employ such
Inactive Designated Office

 



58

    

 Business Employee in accordance with its applicable policies, practices and
procedures in effect on the date hereof, if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement had not occurred, and (B) for employment effective as of such
date on which the applicable Inactive Designated Office Business Employee
returns from a leave of absence (so long as such return occurs within 90 days
after the last day services are provided by the applicable Designated Office
Business Employee pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or such later
time as may be required by applicable Law). Buyer shall provide Seller, in
writing, ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, a list of those
Designated Office Business Employees who have accepted Buyers or its
Affiliates offer of employment and those Designated Office Business Employees
who have not successfully passed Buyers or its Affiliates applicable pre-
employment screening requirements. Buyer shall update such list and provide
such updated list to Seller on the day before the Closing and on the Closing
Date, and shall thereafter promptly inform Seller of any updates to such list
before the last day services are provided pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement.

 

(iii) Each Designated Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment
from Buyer or its Affiliate, passes Buyers or its Affiliates applicable
pre-employment screening requirements, and assumes employment with Buyer or
its Affiliate is referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." The date
of a Transferred Employees commencement of employment with Buyer or its
Affiliate is referred to herein as his or her " _Hire Date_." Effective as of
12:01 a.m. on the applicable Hire Date, Seller or an Affiliate thereof shall
terminate the employment of the applicable Transferred Employee and each such
Transferred Employee shall cease all active participation in and accrual of
benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans. Nothing herein shall be construed as
a representation or guarantee by Seller that any particular Designated
Business Employee shall accept Buyers or its Affiliates offer of employment
or shall continue in employment with Buyer or its Affiliates following the
Closing.

 

(iv) All offers of employment by Buyer or its Affiliate to the Designated
Business Employees shall be subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Closing and the satisfaction of Buyers or its applicable Affiliates
applicable pre-employment screening processes and made on terms and conditions
sufficient to meet the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 9.16_. Seller
shall provide Buyer or its designated Affiliates three calendar years of bonus
history for the Designated Business Employees.

 

(v) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the transfers of employment, shall not constitute a
severance or termination of employment of any Transferred Employee prior to or
upon the applicable Hire Date for purposes of any severance or termination
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, and that Transferred Employees shall have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
applicable Hire Date.

 



59

    

(b) _C_ _omparability_. With respect to each Transferred Employee, for the
one-year period commencing on his or her applicable Hire Date and ending on
the first anniversary of his or her applicable Hire Date, Buyer or its
Affiliate shall provide each Transferred Employee with (i) a base salary or
hourly base wage, as applicable, and target annual bonus opportunity that are
not less than such Transferred Employees base salary or hourly base wage, as
applicable, and target annual bonus opportunity provided by Seller or its
Affiliate immediately prior to the Execution Date, (ii) employee benefits
under each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliate (each, a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") that
are no less favorable than the employee benefits provided to Buyers or its
Affiliates similarly situated employees as of such Transferred Employees
Hire Date and (iii) severance eligibility and other potential separation
benefits (other than out placement services) that are no less favorable than
the severance and other separation benefits provided by Seller or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Execution Date, which severance and
other separation benefits are described in the Employee Notification.

(c) _S_ _everance Liabilities_.

 

(i) With respect to each Business Employee that does not become a Designated
Business Employee and each Designated Business Employee that does not accept
an offer of employment from Buyer or its Affiliate made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.16 _(each, a " _Non-Continuing Business Employee_"), Seller
shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates from, all Liabilities that may result in respect of claims
for severance or other separation benefits (whether statutory, contractual or
common law) or other legally mandated payment obligations (including claims
for wrongful dismissal, notice of termination of employment or pay in lieu of
notice) with respect to each Non-Continuing Business Employee, together with
the employer-paid portion of any employment or payroll taxes related thereto,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with (i) Buyers or
its Affiliates failure to offer employment to or continue the employment of
any Non-Continuing Business Employee __ or (ii) the termination of employment
of any Non-Continuing Business Employee; _provided, however,_ that in the
event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates breaches _Section_ __ _ 9.16(m)_,
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any and all Liabilities incurred by
Seller and its Affiliates, if any, arising out of or with respect to the
termination by Seller or its Affiliates of any Business Employee with respect
to whom such breach has occurred (including any severance and other
separation benefits paid by Seller or its Affiliates to such Business
Employee, together with the employer-paid portion of any employment or payroll
taxes related thereto). In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall, within
ten (10) days thereof, notify Seller of the hiring by Buyer or its Affiliates
of any such Business Employee during the applicable period set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.16(m)_.

 



60

    

(ii) Buyer or its Affiliate shall be solely responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from, all Liabilities that may
result in respect of claims for severance or other separation benefits
(whether statutory, contractual or common law) or other legally mandated

employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
Buyer or its Affiliate under which Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate on or after the applicable Hire Date for service accrued or
deemed accrued on or prior to the applicable Hire Date with Seller or any
Affiliate thereof to the same extent that such credit was recognized by Seller
or an Affiliate thereof under comparable Seller Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the applicable Hire Date; _provided, however_ , that such credit need
not be provided to the extent that such credit would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(e) _P_ _re-Existing Conditions/Copayment Credit_. With respect to
each welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained, sponsored or
contributed to by Buyer or its Affiliates after the applicable Hire Date
(collectively, the " _Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which any

participate on or after the applicable Hire Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall
(i) waive, or cause its Affiliates or insurance carrier to waive, all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, actively-at-work requirements,
exclusions and waiting periods, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each Transferred Employee or spouse or
dependent thereof, and any other restrictions that would prevent immediate or
full participation by such Transferred Employee or spouse or dependent
thereof, under such Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan, to the same extent
satisfied or waived under a comparable Seller Benefit Plan, and (ii) provide
or cause its Affiliates to provide full credit to each Transferred Employee or
spouse or dependent thereof for any co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket
expenses and for any lifetime maximums paid by such Transferred Employee or
spouse or dependent thereof under the comparable Seller Benefit Plan during
the relevant plan year up to and including the applicable Hire Date as if such
amounts had been paid under such Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan.

 

(f) _4_ _01(k) Plan_.

 

(i) If Buyer or its Affiliate shall have in effect at the Closing Date one or
more defined contribution plans that include a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer
401(k) Plan_ "), each Transferred Employee participating in a Seller Benefit
Plan that is a 

 



61

    

 defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Seller
401(k) Plan_ ") immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date shall become
eligible to participate in the corresponding Buyer 401(k) Plan as of the
applicable Hire Date, and each Transferred Employee who would have become
eligible to participate in the Seller 401(k) Plan shall become eligible to
participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan no later than such time as he or she
would have become eligible to participate in the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

(ii) Buyer or its Affiliate shall take all steps necessary to permit each
Transferred Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as
defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Seller 401(k) Plan to roll
over such eligible rollover distribution, including any associated loans, as
part of a lump sum cash distribution into an account(s) under the Buyer
401(k) Plan.

(g) _Vacation_. For purposes of determining the number of vacation or annual
leave days to which each Transferred Employee shall be entitled following his
or her Hire Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall assume and honor all vacation
or annual leave days accrued or earned with Seller or its Affiliate but not
yet taken by such Transferred Employee (and for which such Transferred
Employee was not paid by Seller or its Affiliate) as of his or her Hire Date.
To the extent that a Transferred Employee is entitled under any applicable Law
or any policy of Seller or an Affiliate thereof to be paid for any vacation
or annual leave days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Transferred
Employee as of his or her Hire Date, and such Transferred Employee does not
elect to transfer such vacation or annual leave days accrued or earned but
not yet taken to his or her employment with Buyer or its Affiliate, then
Seller shall discharge the liability for such vacation or annual leave days.

 

(h) _W_ _ARN Act and Other Notices_. Buyer shall not take any action during
the 90-day period following the Closing with respect to the Transferred
Employees that would give rise to a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" under the
WARN Act, whether standing alone or when aggregated with applicable pre-
Closing "employment losses" (as defined under the WARN Act). Buyer agrees to
provide, or to cause its Affiliates to provide, any required notice under the
WARN Act and to otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" or similar event affecting Transferred Employees
(including as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) and occurring on or after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
assume liability for, and fully indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates with respect to, any Liability incurred by Seller or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to the WARN Act in connection with any Business Employee,
to the extent such liability arises from actions of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates on or after the Closing, including with respect to the actions
described in the immediately preceding sentences. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyers agreement herein to assume Liability for, and to fully indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates with respect to, any Liability
incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the Warn Act
shall also apply to any Liability arising under the WARN Act due to any
Business Employees termination or other employment loss resulting from the
Buyers or its Affiliates failure to offer employment to such Business
Employee.

 



62

    

(i) _Employment Liabilities_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, Seller shall retain responsibility for (i) all employment and
employee benefits-related Liabilities that relate to the Business Employees
(or any dependent or beneficiary of any Business Employee) under any Seller
Benefit Plan or that arise with respect to the Business Employees as a result
of an event or events that occurred prior to 12:01 a.m. on the applicable Hire
Date of each such Business Employee, and (ii) any Liability that is or may be
imposed on Midstream Company or Upstream Company due to such entitys status
as a current or former ERISA Affiliate of Seller. Effective as of 12:01 a.m.
on the applicable Hire Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall assume and be solely
responsible for all employment and employee benefits-related Liabilities that
relate to the Transferred Employees (or any dependent or beneficiary of any
Transferred Employee) that arise as a result of an event or events that
occurred on or after 12:01 a.m. on the applicable Hire Date.

(j) _Employment Tax Reporting Responsibility_. Seller and Buyer hereby agree
to follow the standard procedure for employment tax withholding as provided
in Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, I.R.B. 2004-35. Accordingly, Seller or an
Affiliate thereof shall have employment tax reporting responsibilities for
the wages and other compensation it pays to Business Employees and Buyer shall
have employment tax reporting responsibilities for the wages and other
compensation it pays to Transferred Employees. 

(k) _Bonus for Year of Hire Date_. Without limiting any other requirement set
forth in this  _Section_ _ 9.16_, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall pay
to each Transferred Employee who remains employed with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates through December 31 of the calendar year in which such Transferred
Employees Hire Date occurs, a prorated portion of such Transferred
Employees annual cash bonus for such calendar year equal to (i) the target

terminate this Agreement pursuant to _clauses_ __ _ (b)_, _(c)_ or _(e)_
above if such Party or its Affiliates are at such time in material breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

 

12.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of _Section_ __

__ _ 3.5_, _Section_ __ _ 4.6_, Section __ _ 4.8_, _Section_ __ _ 9.23_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.25(d)_, this _Section_ __ _ 12.2_, _Section_ __ _ 12.3_,
_Article_ __ _ 13_ (other than  _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ and _Section_ __ _
13.3_) and _Appendix A_ , which provisions shall survive termination of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and the Parties shall
have no Liability or obligation hereunder.

(b) If Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 12.1(c) _or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_ because of (i) the Willful Breach
by Buyer of this Agreement or (ii) the failure of Buyer to Close in the
instance where, as of the Outside Termination Date, and in each case of (i)
and (ii) (A) all of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived in writing by Buyer), (B) Seller is ready, willing
and able to perform its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ and (C) Buyer
nevertheless does not Close, then, in either such event, Seller shall be
entitled as it sole and exclusive remedy to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c) _or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_, in which case Seller
shall be entitled to receive the Deposit as liquidated damages for such
termination, free and clear of any claims thereon by Buyer. The Parties agree

faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to result from such
termination of this Agreement by Seller. Seller agrees that, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, Sellers rights set forth in this Section __ _

_Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_ in the circumstances
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_. Nothing herein shall be
construed to grant or permit Seller to specific performance of Buyers
obligations at Closing and Seller hereby waives any and all rights and
remedies to specific performance of Buyers obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing.

(c) If Buyer is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 12.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_ because of (i) the Willful Breach by
Seller of this Agreement or (ii) the failure of Seller to Close in the
instance where, as of the Outside Termination Date, and in each case of (i)
and (ii) (A) all of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived in writing by Seller), (B) Buyer is ready, willing
and able to perform its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ and (C) Seller
nevertheless does not Close, then, in either such event, Buyer shall be
entitled to, at its option (1) seek specific performance in lieu of
termination or (2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
12.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_ and (x) receive a return of the Deposit
from Seller, free and clear of any claims thereon by Seller and (y) seek
damages up to an aggregate amount not greater than

 



75

    

 an amount equal to the Deposit, subject always to _Section_ __ _ 4.6_.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit Buyer from first seeking
specific performance, but thereafter terminating this Agreement and receiving
a return of the Deposit and seeking damages in lieu of fully prosecuting its
claim for specific performance. Buyer agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, Buyers rights set forth in this Section __ _ 12.2(c)
_shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer if the Closing does not occur
as a result of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
12.1(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_ in the circumstances described in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(c)_.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.2(c)_, then the Parties shall
have no Liability or obligation hereunder as a result of such termination,
and the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer free and clear of any claims
thereon by Seller.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated under _Section_ __ _
12.1_, the Parties shall promptly (but in no event later than three Business
Days after the date of termination) execute or cause to be executed joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the entirety of the Deposit to the Party entitled to receive the
Deposit under this _Section_ __ _ 12.2_.

 

(f) Each Party agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each
Partys rights as provided in  _Sections_ __ _ 12.2(b)_, _12.2(c)_ ,
_12.2(d)_ and _12.2(g)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties if the Closing does not occur as a result of the termination of this
Agreement.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated prior to Closing by Seller under the circumstances
described in _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_, then in addition to the remedies of
Seller provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_, Seller shall have the remedies
described in _Section (h)_ of  _Schedule 9.23_.

(h) Subject to the foregoing, upon the termination of this Agreement neither
Party shall have any other Liability or obligation hereunder.

12.3 _Return of Information_. In the event of termination of this Agreement,
Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within ten days of such termination,
return or cause to be returned to Seller all documents and other materials
obtained from or on behalf of Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall keep confidential any such information, all in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and Buyer

any condition or any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or

adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.
