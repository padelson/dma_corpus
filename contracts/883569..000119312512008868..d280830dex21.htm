for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

PURCHASE OF PURCHASED STOCK

1.1 _Purchase of Purchased Stock_. At the Closing, each Seller shall sell,
transfer, assign and deliver to the applicable Buyer the Purchased Stock of
each Company owned by such Seller, free and clear of any and all Liens, and
each Buyer shall purchase from each Seller the applicable Purchased Stock of
each Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and as set forth on _Schedule A_ attached hereto.

1.2 _Consideration_. As consideration in full for the acquisition of the
Purchased Stock from Sellers at the Closing, Buyers shall pay to Sellers the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ "):

(a) the aggregate sum of $225,000,000 in cash (the " _Cash Purchase Price_ "),
as such sum may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.3_ below. The Cash
Purchase Price will be paid as follows:

(i) subject to _Section 1.3_ below, an amount equal to the Cash Purchase
Price minus (i) the Escrow Amount, minus (ii) any Transaction Expenses that
are unpaid at the Closing, minus (iii) any amounts set forth in the Third
Party Payoff Letters (the " _Initial Payment Amount_ "), will be paid at
Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) and
Persons specified in _Schedule 1.2(a)_, which Parent and the Representative
shall agree upon prior to the Closing (the " _Flow of Funds Memorandum_ ");
and 

(ii) $20,000,000 of the Cash Purchase Price (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") will be
wired at Closing to the Escrow Agent to the account(s) specified in the
Escrow Agreement to be retained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 7.7_
below and the Escrow Agreement as security for the indemnification obligations
of Sellers under _Article VII_.

(b) 150,000 shares (the " _Purchase Price Shares_ ") of Parent common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), free and clear of any
and all Liens, subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 1.7_ and all
applicable securities Laws; plus

 

(c) up to 100,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Earnout Shares_ ") as
set forth in  _Section 1.4_ below, which shall be issued, if issuable,
within sixty days after the last day of the Earnout Period, subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 1.2(c)_ and _1.4(a)_ (the " _Earnout
Common Stock Issuance Date_ "), to the extent earned, free and clear of any
and all Liens, subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 1.7_ and all

 



2  applicable securities Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as set forth in
the Albrechtslund Parent Employment Agreement, if Albrechtslund is employed by
Parent or its Subsidiaries as of the Earnout Common Stock Issuance Date, (A)
a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (x) 1% of the Earnout
Shares earned in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_ and otherwise issuable to
Skagen US Sellers and (y) the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the
last trading day immediately prior to the Earnout Common Stock Issuance Date
shall be paid to Mr. Steen Albrechtslund in accordance with the Albrechtslund
Parent Employment Agreement and (B) the aggregate number of Earnout Shares
issuable to Skagen US Sellers shall be reduced by 1%.

(d)  _Recapitalization_. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Earnout Common Stock Issuance Date (the " _Earnout
Period_ "), the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, including all
shares of Parent Common Stock held as treasury stock, shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities through reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock), share split,
reverse share split, or other like changes in Parents capitalization, or a
record date during the Earnout Period has been established by Parent in
regard to any of the foregoing, the number of Earnout Shares shall be
appropriately adjusted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers acknowledge
that Parent currently and from time to time purchases shares of Parent Common
Stock as part of a share repurchase program and such share repurchases shall
not be deemed to be a recapitalization for purposes of this _Section 1.2(d)_
or in any way trigger any adjustment to the number of the Earnout Shares.

 

(e) _Cash Dividends_. To the extent that any Earnout Shares are earned
pursuant to _Section 1.4_, in the event that between the last Business Day
of the Earnout Period and the Earnout Common Stock Issuance Date Parent
distributes to all or substantially all holders of Parent Common Stock any
cash dividends, Parent shall distribute to the Skagen US Sellers an amount,
with respect to each Earnout Share earned pursuant to _Section 1.4_, in cash
(without interest) equal to the cash dividends distributed on an outstanding
share of Parent Common Stock during such period.

 

1.3 _Cash Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) The Companies shall deliver to Buyers a consolidated, estimated balance
sheet prepared in good faith in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") for the Companies with each asset
and liability valued and listed in reasonable detail on a line-by-line basis
as of the beginning of business on the Closing Date prepared consistent with
the Companies prior calculation and presentation of such assets and
liabilities to the extent applicable (the " _Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") at least three days prior to the Closing Date. The Cash Purchase
Price, as adjusted pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_ and (if applicable)
_Section 1.3(c)_, shall be referred to as the " _Adjusted Cash Purchase
Price_."

 



3 (i) If the Working Capital on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (the "
_Preliminary Working Capital_ "), which shall solely for purposes of the
determination of the amount of the Preliminary Working Capital assume that the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries are free of surplus cash and all
indebtedness, is (A) equal to $26,500,000 (" _Target Working Capital_ "), (B)
greater than Target Working Capital by an amount no more than $250,000, or (C)
less than Target Working Capital by an amount less than $250,000, then,
in each case, there shall be no adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price at
Closing.

(ii) If the Preliminary Working Capital is greater than Target Working
Capital, plus $250,000, then the Cash Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount equal to (A) the Preliminary Working Capital, less (B) Target Working
Capital.

 

(iii) If the Preliminary Working Capital is less than Target Working Capital
by an amount equal to or in excess of $250,000, then the Cash Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to (A) Target Working Capital, less (B)
the Preliminary Working Capital.

(b) Parent shall have the right during the 90-day period after the Closing
Date to review and audit the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and all
underlying matters, including, all financial statements and assets and
liabilities related thereto, and to examine and review all records and work
papers and other supporting documents used to prepare such Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet. Parent shall notify the Representative in writing, on or
before the last day of the 90-day period after the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet Dispute Deadline_ "), of any objections to the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Balance Sheet Dispute
Notice_ "), which written notice shall specify the nature of any objections
and the basis therefor in reasonable detail (it being understood and agreed
that any component in the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet that is not the
subject of such written objection notice, or affected thereby, by the Closing
Balance Sheet Dispute Deadline shall be final and binding on the parties). If
Parent does not deliver a Closing Balance Sheet Dispute Notice on or prior to
the Closing Balance Sheet Dispute Deadline, the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet shall deemed to be accepted by Buyers and shall become final (the "
_Final Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with the Adjusted Cash Purchase
Price.

 

(c) If Parent objects to any line items set forth on the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet, the parties shall attempt to resolve any such objections
within 30-days of receipt by the Representative of any such Closing Balance
Sheet Dispute Notice. If the parties are unable to resolve the matter within
such 30-day period, Parent and the Representative shall jointly appoint an
impartial internationally recognized independent certified public accounting
firm that is not at such time (and has not within the prior 12-month period
prior to such time been) engaged by any of the parties or their respective
Affiliates (the " _Impartial Accounting Firm_ ") mutually acceptable to the
parties (or, if they cannot agree on a mutually acceptable firm, they shall
cause their respective accounting firms to select such firm) within five days
after the end of such 30-day period to resolve any such remaining matters.
Any such resolution shall be conclusive and binding on the parties and the
fees of the Impartial Accounting Firm shall be borne equally (and paid
directly) by Parent, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.

 



4  The parties shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the Impartial Accounting Firm and shall instruct the
Impartial Accounting Firm to reach its conclusion regarding the disputed
matters (and only such disputed matters) and to declare a Final Closing
Balance Sheet within 30 days of its appointment to settle the dispute.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Impartial
Accounting Firm may not in making its determination pursuant to this _Section
1.3(c)_ determine that the amount of a line item is (i) with respect to an
asset, less than the value set forth in Parents Closing Balance Sheet
Dispute Notice or more than the value set forth in the Preliminary Closing
Balance Statement or (ii) with respect to a liability, less than the amount
set forth in the Preliminary Closing Balance Statement or more than the amount
set forth in Parents Closing Balance Sheet Dispute Notice, as applicable.

(d) Upon receipt of the Impartial Accounting Firms conclusions, the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be adjusted to reflect such
conclusions and shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Balance Sheet and to
be irrevocably accepted by Buyers, the Companies and the Sellers. 

(e) If the Working Capital on the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Final
Working Capital_ ") is an amount different than the Working Capital on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, then the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price shall
be determined in accordance with _Section 1.3(a)_, except that (x) the Final
Working Capital shall be used for purposes of such calculation in lieu of the
Preliminary Working Capital and (y) only to the extent that there was any
surplus cash and/or indebtedness remaining in the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries immediately after Closing, the determination of the Final
Working Capital shall not give effect to the assumption specified in _Section
1.3(a)(i)_ that the Companies and Company Subsidiaries are free of surplus
cash and all indebtedness (the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price determined
pursuant to this _Section 1.3(e)_, shall be referred to as the " _Final
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price_ ").

(i) In the event that the Final Adjusted Cash Purchase Price is less than the
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price (as determined pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_),
(I) Parent and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to
Parent funds in an amount (up to, but not exceeding, $1,000,000) equal to (A)
the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price (as determined pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)_), minus (B) the Final Adjusted Cash Purchase Price (such amount, the
" _Aggregate Working Capital Payment Amount_ "), to the account specified in
writing to the Representative by Parent within five Business Days of the date
of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and (II) to the extent the Aggregate
Working Capital Payment Amount is in excess of $1,000,000, the Representative
shall deliver to Parent by wire transfer to the account specified in writing
to the Representative by Parent, immediately available funds, in an amount
equal to (A) the Aggregate Working Capital Payment Amount, minus (B)

1.4 _Earnout_.

(a) If Parents aggregate Net Sales derived from the sale or distribution of
Skagen-branded products (including all corporate/private label related brands
other than "Grenen") for the Earnout Period calculated in accordance with GAAP
and as reflected in the Parents financial statements for such Earnout Period
(such twelve-month period, the " _Earnout Period Net Sales_ "), are equal to
or greater than $155,000,000 but less than $160,000,000, then Parent shall
issue 50,000 Earnout Shares to Skagen US Sellers in accordance with _Section
1.2(c)_. If Earnout Period Net Sales are equal to or greater than $160,000,000
but less than $165,000,000, then Parent shall issue 75,000 Earnout Shares to
Skagen US Sellers in accordance with _Section 1.2(c)_. If Earnout Period Net
Sales are equal to or greater than $165,000,000, then Parent shall issue
100,000 Earnout Shares to Skagen US Sellers in accordance with _Section
1.2(c)_. The Earnout Shares set forth above shall not be additive. For
example, and not by way of limitation, if Earnout Period Net Sales are
US$170,000,000, the number of Earnout Shares shall be 100,000. The Earnout
Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Purchase Price
Shares. For purposes hereof, the term " _Net Sales_ " means, without
duplication, for any period, the amount of all Skagen-branded products
(including all corporate/private label related brands other than "Grenen")
sold (determined on the basis of the aggregate invoice price for such
products, subject to adjustment in the manner set forth below in this
definition) by Parent and its Subsidiaries for such period, less the related
amount of any product returns, and further reduced by any markdowns, non-
invoice related pricing discounts, rebates, promotions, coupons and similar
items of such products, calculated in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout such specified period.

(b) Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) upon the Closing, Buyers have the
right to operate the Companies and the Business (and all other components of
Buyers business) as Parent deems appropriate in Parents sole discretion,
(ii) Buyers have no obligation to operate the Companies or the Business (or
any other component of Buyers business) in a manner designed specifically to
achieve the Earnout Period Net Sales standards set forth in _Section 1.4(a)_
above, (iii) Buyers are not obligated to operate the Companies or the Business
in the manner in which Sellers operated the Companies and the Business prior
to the Closing Date, (iv) none of Buyers nor their respective Affiliates are
under any obligation to continue to serve any customer or distributor or to
develop any new products derived from the Skagen-branded products after the
Closing Date (and Buyers may offer Skagen-branded products to any customer or
distributor or prospective customer or distributor for trial or promotional
purposes, the value of which will not be credited to Earnout Period Net Sales
to the extent no proceeds are paid by such customer, distributor or
prospective customer or distributor), (v) the potential payment of any Earnout
Shares described in this _Section 1.4_ is speculative and subject
to numerous factors outside the control of Buyers, (vi) Buyers owe no
fiduciary duty or express or implied duty to any Seller, including no implied
duty of good faith and fair dealing, other 

 



6  than any duties to Sellers expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (vii)
the parties solely intend the express provisions of this Agreement to govern
their contractual relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 1.4(b)_, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, intentionally and knowingly take, or intentionally and knowingly not take,
any action or series of actions for which the primary goal of Parent or the
applicable Subsidiary (at the time the action is taken or not taken) is
reducing, in bad faith, Earnout Period Net Sales and the number of Earnout
Shares that will become payable hereunder.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the right of
Skagen US Sellers under this _Section 1.4_ to receive any amount of Earnout
Shares (A) is a non-transferable contract right (and is not a security (and
shall confer upon Skagen US Sellers only the rights of a general unsecured
creditor)); (B) will not be represented by any form of certificate or
instrument; (C) except as expressly contemplated in _Section 1.2_, does not
give Skagen US Sellers any dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation rights,
preemptive rights or other similar rights; (D) is not redeemable; and (E)
shall not be transferred or assigned to any other Person.

(d) Within two Business Days after the Earnout Common Stock Issuance Date,
Parent shall provide written notice to the Representative of the Earnout
Period Net Sales, which notice shall (i) be certified by an officer of Parent
and (ii) be accompanied by reasonable supporting details (including a general
ledger and trial balance) and calculations of the Earnout Period Net Sales.
Parent shall provide the Representative (and its representatives) with such
information and access to Parents employees and representatives as the
Representative may reasonably request in order for the Representative to
review such calculations.

1.5  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the purchase and sale of
the Purchased Stock will take place at the offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP,
2323 Victory Avenue, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75219, or via overnight

(b) Until the Parent Common Stock issued hereunder is eligible for resale
under Rule 144 (" _Rule 144_ ") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), all certificates representing Parent
Common Stock, or any book entry or Depository Trust Company entry, if

to so legend such shares of Parent Common Stock:

"The shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Fossil, Inc. have

otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement

presented to Fossil, Inc. an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Fossil, Inc. to the effect that registration is not required in connection

(including the legend specified in _Section 1.7(b)_).

1.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated for
all purposes (including Tax purposes) in accordance with the methodology set
forth in _Schedule B_ hereto (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ") and such
final determination shall be made by the mutual agreement of Parent and the
Representative, subject to applicable Laws and approval by Parents
independent auditor and valuation expert, within 120 days after the Closing;
provided, that Buyers and Sellers agree that such determination shall be based
upon each of Skagen Europe and Skagen HK being allocated a portion of the

the Purchase Price being allocated to Skagen US. Unless prohibited by
applicable Laws, each of the parties hereto will not take a position on any
Tax Return, before any Governmental Body charged with the collection of any
Tax, or in any action or Litigation, that is in any way inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation and will cooperate with each other in timely filing
consistent with such allocation with the IRS. The Purchase Price Allocation
derived by Parent in accordance with this _Section 1.8_ shall be binding on

Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item
resulting from the §338(h)(10) Election or §338(g) Election in their Tax
returns to the extent required by applicable law.

 



11 (b) With respect to making the §338(h)(10) Election or the §338(g) Election,
Parent shall prepare an initial draft of IRS Form 8883 in accordance with the
rules of Section 1060 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
and shall deliver such initial draft to the Representative, who shall
within 60 days thereafter provide to Parent the Representatives suggested
revisions thereto. Parent shall, within an additional 60 days thereafter,
finalize such IRS Form 8883, including the Representatives comments, as
Parent reasonably deems appropriate. Parent and each Seller shall attach such
IRS Form 8883 to their respective tax returns for the tax year in which the
Closing Date occurs, and to the extent that the Purchase Price is adjusted,
revise and amend the allocation Schedule and IRS Form 8883 as necessary.

Bylaws or comparable company organizational document, if any (each to be

3.5 _Assets; Real Property_.

(a) Set forth in  _Schedule 3.5(a)_ is a complete and accurate list, as of
the date hereof, of (i) the street address and a legal description of the real
property owned by any Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Owned
Real Property_ "); and (ii) each other tangible asset that has a resale value
in excess of $100,000 that is owned by any Company or any Company Subsidiary.
None of the Companies nor any Company Subsidiary leases or, other than the
Owned Real Property, otherwise uses any real property in connection with the
Business or otherwise. The Companies and the Company Subsidiaries own, lease,
license or otherwise have full use of all tangible assets necessary to carry
on the Business as currently conducted in all material respects.

(b) Each Company and each Company Subsidiary has, and upon the Closing will
have, good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of
the tangible Assets, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens
(and as to the Owned Real Property, free of all encumbrances or exceptions to
title other than those listed on _Schedule 3.5(b)_ or subsequently approved
in writing by Buyers (collectively, the " _Permitted Exceptions_ ")). To the
Knowledge of the Seller Group, the tangible Assets, including any tangible
Assets held under leases or licenses: (i) are in good condition and repair,
ordinary wear and tear excepted; and (ii) are in good working order and have
been properly and regularly maintained.

 



19 (c) The Owned Real Property is zoned for a classification that permits
the continued use of the Owned Real Property in the manner currently used by
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries. Improvements made to the Owned
Real Property were constructed, in all material respects, in full compliance
with, and remain in compliance with, all applicable Laws, covenants,
conditions and restrictions affecting the Owned Real Property. There are no
actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller Group, threatened that
would alter the current zoning classification of the Owned Real Property or
alter any applicable Laws, covenants, conditions or restrictions that would
adversely affect the use of the Owned Real Property, as currently conducted.
No member of the Seller Group has received notice from any insurance company
or Governmental Body of any defects or inadequacies in the Owned Real Property
or the improvements thereon that would materially and adversely affect the
insurability or usability of the Owned Real Property or such improvements or
prevent the issuance of new insurance policies thereon at rates not
materially higher than present rates. Neither Skagen US nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a "foreign person" as that term is defined in Section 1445 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
applicable regulations. The Owned Real Property is not subject to assessment
or collection of additional Taxes for prior years based on a change in land
usage or ownership. No portion of the Owned Real Property has been condemned,
requisitioned or otherwise taken by any public authority and there is no
pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Seller Group, threatened or contemplated
condemnation actions or special assessments with respect to the Owned Real
Property. None of the Companies nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
request or notice (written or otherwise) from any Governmental Body with
regard to the dedication of the Owned Real Property or any portion thereof. 

(d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.5(d)_, the Owned Real Property is not
subject to any lease, license or sublease (" _Tenant Leases_ ") or other
possessory interests, including, but not limited to, conditional sale or other
title retention agreements, reservations, options and rights of first refusal.
Except for the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the tenants, licensees
or sublessees (hereinafter " _Tenant_ ") under the agreements described in
_Schedule 3.5(d)_, there are no parties in possession of, or that have the
right to possess, any portion of such Owned Real Property as lessees, tenants
at sufferance, or trespassers. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has
performed and complied with all of its obligations under the Tenant Leases as
and when required, and there exists no fact or circumstance that, with or
without notice or passage of time, or both, could constitute a default of the
landlord or, to the Knowledge of the Seller Group, lessor under any of the
Tenant Leases, or entitle any Tenant thereunder to any offset or defenses
against the prompt and current payment of rent or the performance of any other
obligation of the Tenant thereunder. There are no rental or other concessions
of any nature granted to any Tenant under the Tenant Leases. There are no
Tenant Leases or other agreements with respect to such Owned Real Property
that give any Tenant the right to purchase such Owned Real Property or any
part thereof. The rentals and other sums due or to become due under the Tenant
Leases have not been, and will not be, assigned, encumbered or subjected to
any Liens as of the Closing Date.

(e) Skagen Europe, Skagen HK and all entities that would be deemed to be
controlled by either such Company under the HSR Act (i) do not hold assets
located in the U.S. with an aggregate total value over $66,000,000 and (ii)
did not have sales in or into the U.S. totaling over $66,000,000 in the
aggregate in their most recent fiscal year.

 



20 3.6 _No Violation_. Except as described in _Schedule 3.6_, neither
the execution or delivery of the Company Documents or Seller Documents nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the sale
of the Purchased Stock to Buyers, will conflict with or result in the breach
of any term or provision of, require consent, approval or authorization or
violate or constitute a default under (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both would constitute a breach or default), or result in the
creation of any Lien on the Purchased Stock or any material Asset pursuant
to, or relieve any Person of any obligation to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or give any Person the right to terminate or accelerate any
obligation under, any charter provision, bylaw (or similar governing
document), Business Contracts, material Permit or applicable Law (assuming the
termination of the waiting periods referred to in _Section 2.2(b)_ and
assuming any consents from each Governmental Body referred to in  _Section
2.2(b)_ required to be obtained by the Company under Antitrust Laws are
obtained) to which any member of the Seller Group is a party or by which any
member of the Seller Group or any of the Purchased Stock, the Assets or
the Business is in any way bound or obligated.

3.7 _Consents_. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, qualification, designation, declaration or filing with, any
governmental or quasi-governmental agency, authority, commission, board or
other body (collectively, a " _Governmental Body_ ") is required on the part
of the Companies or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the sale and
purchase of the Purchased Stock or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except for the filing of a pre-merger notification and
report form under the HSR Act, the filing of any forms required to be filed

or liabilities of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent,
liquidated or otherwise, and whether due or to become due, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown (collectively, " _Liabilities_ ") of a nature
required to be reflected on a balance sheet (or in the notes thereto)
prepared in accordance with GAAP, DFSA or HKFRS, as applicable, except for:
(i) Liabilities reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet; (ii) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice
after the Latest Balance Sheet Date; (iii) Ordinary Course Obligations under

operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect any Companys or any Company Subsidiarys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information.

of each of the parties. Each member of the Seller Group and each Buyer hereby
agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality

to cause its representatives to, treat the Confidential Information, together
with any other confidential information furnished to any Seller or the Seller
Representative of such Seller by Buyers, as confidential and not to make use

purposes or for the benefit of any other Person (other than in connection with
operating the Business prior to the Closing or on behalf of, and at the
direction of, any Buyer after the Closing); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Confidential Information and any other confidential information furnished by
Buyers shall not include (i) any information which is readily available in the
public domain, (ii) information which was provided to such Seller or a Seller
Representative by a third party without violation of any confidential
obligation owed to Parent, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or their

Seller Representative can demonstrate resulted from its own research and
development, independent of such Confidential Information or other
confidential information furnished by Buyers, the Companies or any Company
Subsidiary; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.10_

notice of such requirement and an opportunity to excuse or restrict such
production).

 

5.11 _Tax Information_. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall provide the other party with such reasonable cooperation and

for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes or in conducting any audit
or proceeding in respect of Taxes; provided, that Sellers shall only be
entitled to file any such return, amended return or claim for a refund of
Taxes with respect to their Forms 1120 S with respect to Skagen US. Such
reasonable cooperation and information shall include providing copies of

Letters_ "). The Companies shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to
make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent for such debt holders to
provide to Parent recordable form mortgage and lien releases, canceled notes
and other documents reasonably requested by Parent at least 3 Business Days
prior to the Closing such that all Liens granted to such debt holders in
respect of such indebtedness on the assets or properties of any of the
Companies or any of the Company Subsidiaries that are not
Permitted Exceptions shall be satisfied, terminated and discharged on or
prior to the Closing Date.

5.14 _Books and Records_. At or promptly following the Closing, to the extent

of the Companies), managers, officers and employees, their respective
successors, assigns and Affiliates, and each other Seller or his or her heirs,
executors, administrators, successors or assigns, from and all claims,

expenses), obligations, liabilities and/or damages of every kind and nature
whatsoever, whether now existing or known, relating in any way, directly or

 



48  indirectly, to either any Company, any Company Subsidiary, this Agreement or

condition or circumstance existing at any time up to and including the
Closing, that such Seller may have had, now have or may hereafter claim to
have against any such Person; _provided_ , that the foregoing release is not
intended to and shall not (i) affect any obligations of Buyers to Sellers
under this Agreement or the documents executed in connection herewith or (ii)
affect any obligations of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to the payment of any salaries, commissions, bonuses and
expenses that were accrued on or prior to the Closing in the ordinary course
of business and unpaid as of the Closing and any accrued and unpaid vacation
time.

5.17 _Payments under Albrechtslund Employment Agreement_. After the

Subsidiaries to retain enough cash in the Companies and Company Subsidiaries

Albrechtslund Bonus Amount) as such are due in the ordinary course of business
and to pay off all outstanding indebtedness to the extent possible of such
Company and such Company Subsidiaries prior to Closing.

7.1 _Indemnification of Buyers._ Notwithstanding any investigation by Buyers
or their representatives, from and after the Closing, each Seller shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold Buyers, their respective
Affiliates and their respective directors, managers, officers, employees and
agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Parties_ ") harmless from any and all
liabilities, obligations, claims (including, solely with respect to _Section
7.1(d)_, asserted claims), damages, costs and reasonable expenses, including
all investigative costs, court costs, litigation expenses and reasonable
attorneys and accountants fees incurred (or, solely with respect to
_Section 7.1(d)_, in the case of asserted claims, to be incurred)
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") that any Buyer Party suffers or incurs (or,
solely with respect to _Section 7.1(d)_, in the case of asserted claims, may
suffer or incur) as a result of or relating to:

(a) the inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Companies or any Seller in this Agreement;

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by any member of the Seller
Group in this Agreement;

(c) the Companies redemption of their capital stock from the Sellers and
previous stockholders of the Company or any previous sale, transfer or
assignment of the Purchased Stock or any capital stock of the Companies, in
each case, on or before the Closing; 

(d) all Taxes of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of the
Pre-Closing Period, including Taxes arising as a result of the §338(g)
Election or the §338(h)(10) Election;

_provided_ , that (I) except with respect to (i) the inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach or the alleged inaccuracy, misrepresentation or
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.1_

Purchased

 



52  Stock), _Section 3.1_ (Organization), _Section 3.2_ (Authority;
Enforceability; Ownership of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries),
_Section 3.3_ (Capitalization), _Section 3.10_ (Taxes), or _Section 10.3_
(Brokers) (collectively, the " _Special Indemnification Representations_ ");
or (ii) any fraud (which shall, in all instances in this _Article VII_ ,
require scienter) or intentional or criminal misconduct by any member of the
Seller Group in connection with this Agreement, the documents executed in
connection herewith or the Contemplated Transactions, for which no such
limitation will apply, the Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification under paragraph (a) of this _Section 7.1_ unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses suffered or incurred by the Buyer Parties
(without duplication) resulting out of or relating to the matters set forth
in such paragraph exceeds $750,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") in which case the
Buyer Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for the amount of all
Losses greater than the Deductible and (II) except with respect to (i) the

any member of the Seller Group in connection with this Agreement, the
documents executed in connection herewith or the Contemplated Transactions,
for which no such limitation will apply, the maximum aggregate liability for
which the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this _Section 7.1_ is the Escrow Amount contained in the Escrow

respect to the Deductible and the Cap shall be wholly inapplicable to any
claims for indemnification under _Section 7.1(b)_,  _Section 7.1(c)_,
_Section 7.1(d)_ and _Section 7.1(e)_. To the extent a Buyer Party has a
claim for indemnification under both _Section 7.1(a)_ and _Section 7.1(b)_,
_Section 7.1(c)_,  _Section 7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ arising out of or
related to the same set of facts or circumstances, the limitations of the
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to such matter, regardless of the claim
actually asserted by the Buyer Party. For purposes of calculating the amount

all materiality qualifiers shall be excluded from and given no effect with
respect to the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to each
representation and warranty; _provided_ that, such qualifiers will not be
disregarded with respect to determining whether an inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty has occurred.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Seller shall be liable
for, or obligated to pay, any Buyer Party any Losses arising under _Section
7.1(a)_ (except with respect to (x) the inaccuracy, misrepresentation or
breach or the alleged inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of the Special
Indemnification Representations or (y) any fraud or intentional or criminal
misconduct by any member of the Seller Group in connection with this
Agreement, the documents executed in connection herewith or the Contemplated
Transactions, for which no such limitation will apply) to the extent such
Losses are less than or equal to $25,000 (the " _De Minimis Basket_ ");
provided, that for the purposes of calculating Losses and evaluating whether
such Losses exceed the De Minimis Basket, all Losses arising out of, or in
connection with, a series of related events or circumstances shall be
aggregated.

 

THESE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS ARE INTENDED TO ALLOCATE LIABILITY FOR, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, (I) ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OR
ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE OF ANY BUYER PARTY AND (II) STATUTORY AND COMMON LAW
NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY CLAIMS, AS WELL AS, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS ARISING UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY
REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CERCLA. This paragraph is intended solely to

 



53  ensure no legal concept of "express negligence" or "conspicuousness" limits
any partys ability to realize the benefits of the contractual provisions
hereof and this paragraph is not intended to, and shall not, create any
independent basis for recovery by any party against any other party. Buyers
acknowledge and agree that no claim, other than fraud, shall be instituted, or
rights shall be asserted, against any of the officers (in their capacities as
such) with respect to any inaccuracies contained, or any breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements specified, in the
certificates delivered pursuant to _Sections 1.6(l)_ and  _1.6(m)_

7.2 _Indemnification of Sellers_. From and after the Closing, Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold Sellers and their respective agents (collectively,
the " _Seller Parties_ ") harmless from any and all Losses that any Seller
suffers or incurs as a result of or relating to:

 

(a) the inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made by Buyers in this Agreement; 

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyers in this Agreement
or pursuant hereto; or 

(c) any and all expenses incident to any and all Losses with respect to which
indemnification is provided hereunder;

_provided_ , that no Seller will be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
for which the Buyer Parties are entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.1_; and _provided further_ , that except with respect to (i) the inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach or the alleged inaccuracy, misrepresentation or
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1
_(Organization), _4.2_ (Authority; Enforceability), _4.10_ (Parent Common
Stock), or _Section 10.3_ (Brokers); or (ii) any fraud or intentional or
criminal misconduct by Buyers in connection with this Agreement, the
documents executed in connection herewith or the Contemplated Transactions, in
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) for which no such limitation will apply, (A)
the Sellers shall not be entitled to indemnification under paragraph (a) of
this _Section 7.2_ unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for which
indemnification is sought by the Seller Parties pursuant to such paragraph
exceeds an amount equal to the Deductible in which case the Seller Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification only for the amount of all Losses greater
than the Deductible; and (B) the maximum aggregate liability for which the
Seller Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under paragraph (a) of
this _Section 7.2_ is an amount equal to the Cap. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Buyer shall be liable for, or obligated to pay, any
Seller Party any Losses arising under  _Section 7.2(a)_ (except with respect
to (x) the inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach or the alleged inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.1_ (Organization), _4.2_ (Authority; Enforceability), or
_Section 10.3_ (Brokers); or (y) any fraud or intentional or criminal
misconduct by Buyers in connection with this Agreement, the documents executed
in connection herewith or the Contemplated Transactions, in the case of

for the purposes of calculating Losses and evaluating whether such Losses
exceed the De Minimis Basket, all Losses arising out of, or in connection
with, a series of related events or circumstances shall be aggregated.

survive until such claim is finally resolved if Parent notifies the
Representative, or if the Representative notifies Parent, as applicable, of
such claim in reasonable detail prior to the date on which
such representation or warranty would otherwise expire hereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, no claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.2(a)_ based on the misrepresentation or breach or
alleged misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty may be
asserted after the date on which such representation or warranty expires
hereunder. If the Closing occurs, the covenants and agreements of the
Companies, Sellers and Buyer made in or pursuant to this Agreement shall
expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Closing, except to the
extent such covenants or agreements expressly provide that they are to be
performed (in whole or in part) after the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no right to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ in respect of
any claim based upon any breach of a covenant or agreement shall be affected
by the expiration of such covenant.

 

7.4 _Indemnification Rights_.

(a) Except as set forth in this _Article VII_ , the right to indemnification,
reimbursement for or payment of Losses to a Buyer Party or Seller Party, as
applicable, or other remedy based on any such representation, warranty,
agreement, covenant or obligation shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation. Except as set forth herein, the waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty or on the performance of or
compliance with any agreement, covenant or obligation, shall not affect the
right to indemnification, reimbursement for or payment of damages or any other
remedy based on such representation, warranty, agreement, covenant and
obligation.

 



55 (b) Sellers shall have no right of contribution or other recourse against the
Companies or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective directors,
managers, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, stockholders,
members, assigns or successors for any third party claims asserted by the
Buyer Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that the covenants and
agreements of the Companies contained herein are solely for the benefit of the
Buyer Parties.

(c) Other than fraud or intentional or criminal misconduct by any member of
the Seller Group in connection with this Agreement, if the Closing occurs, the
Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses from the Sellers in
respect of any Claims under or pursuant to _Sections 7.1(a)_ (with respect to
any Special Indemnification Representations or _Section 3.12_ (Compliance
with Laws) or _Section 3.18_ (Intellectual Property Rights)), _7.1(b)_ ,
_7.1(c)_ , _7.1(d)_ or _7.1(e)_ in excess of an amount equal to the portion of
the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price payable to the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement (including the amount contributed to the Escrow Account) plus the
value of any shares of Parent Common Stock actually received by such Sellers
(which Parent Common Stock shall be valued at (x) the price at which such
Seller sold any such shares of Parent Common Stock or (y) to the extent any
such shares of Parent Common Stock have not been sold, the then market price
equal to the closing trading price of the Parent Common Stock on the day
immediately preceding the day such indemnification payment is paid to the
Buyer Parties).

(d) Other than fraud or intentional or criminal misconduct by any member of
the Seller Group in connection with this Agreement, if the Closing occurs,
the indemnification, compensation and reimbursement remedies set forth in this
_Article VII_ (subject to the survival periods and other limitations set forth
herein, which shall control over any statutory or common law provisions or
principles to the contrary) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of all
Buyer Parties against the Sellers arising out of, resulting from or with
respect to (A) any of the matters referred to in _Section 7.1_, or (B) a
breach of this Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered in
connection herewith, other than equitable remedies.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Sellers
shall not be liable to or otherwise responsible to any Buyer Party under this
_Article VII_ for consequential, exemplary, punitive, remote, speculative, or
similar damages.

(f) The amount of indemnifiable Losses shall take into account (i) any
insurance proceeds actually recovered from an insurance carrier (net of any
applicable deductibles and other costs or expenses directly relating to such
recovery) by the applicable Buyer Party with respect to the underlying Claim,
and (ii) any indemnity or contribution amounts actually recovered from third
parties (net of any applicable costs or expenses of recovery or collection
thereof); _provided_ , that (A) no Buyer Party shall be required to seek
recovery from any insurance carrier prior to proceeding against Sellers for an
indemnification claim hereunder and (B) the existence of insurance and any
potential recovery thereunder shall not limit the amount of indemnifiable
Losses that a Buyer Party may seek or recover unless such Buyer Party has
actually received such insurance proceeds; _provided_ , _further_ , that if a
Buyer Party receives insurance proceeds

 



56  after having received payment from Sellers with respect to an indemnifiable
Loss, such Buyer Party shall refund such Sellers up to the lesser of (x) the
amount of the insurance proceeds received or (y) the amount of
indemnification received by the Buyer Party from Sellers.

(g) The Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to collect Losses for
indemnifiable matters pursuant to _Section 7.1_ for specific liabilities
accrued for and reserved against with specificity as part of the Preliminary
Working Capital or the Final Working Capital, only with respect to the
specific liability reserved against and only up to the amount of such
liabilities accrued for and reserved against in such Preliminary Working
Capital or Final Working Capital.

 

7.5 _Notice._ Any party entitled to receive indemnification under this
_Article VII_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party required to provide such indemnification
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after becoming aware of the occurrence
of any indemnifiable Loss, or the assertion of any direct claim or the
commencement of any direct action or proceeding by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), in each case, in respect of which such a Loss may reasonably
be expected to occur (a " _Claim_ "), but the Indemnified Partys failure to
give such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under this _Article VII_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. Each Claim Notice shall include a reasonably
detailed reference (based upon the information then possessed by the
Indemnified Party) to the event or events forming the basis of such Loss, the
nature of such Claim and the amount of such Loss (or a good faith estimate
based on the information then possessed by the Indemnified Party of the amount
of such Loss) (the " _Claim Amount_ ").

7.6 _Defense of Claims_.

(a) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may elect to assume and control the defense of any such
Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and the payment of expenses related thereto, if: (i) the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for any Losses resulting from such Claim; (ii) the Claim does not seek
to impose any Liability on the Indemnified Party other than money damages;
and (iii) the Claim does not primarily relate to the Indemnified Partys
relationship with any customer, supplier or employee.

(b) If the conditions of _Section 7.6(a)_ are satisfied and the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume and control the defense of a Claim, then: (i) the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement of such Claim
effected without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; (ii) the Indemnifying Party may settle such Claim
without the consent of the Indemnified Party only if (A) all monetary damages
payable in respect of the Claim are paid by the Indemnifying Party, (B) the
Indemnified Party receives a full, complete and unconditional release in
respect of the Claim without any admission or finding of obligation,
liability, fault or guilt (criminal or otherwise) with respect to the Claim,
and (C) no injunctive, extraordinary, equitable or other relief of any kind is
imposed on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; 

 



57  (iii) the Indemnifying Party may otherwise settle such Claim only with the
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not unreasonably be
withheld, conditioned or delayed; and (iv) the Indemnified Party may employ
separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the Indemnified
Party will be responsible for the fees and expenses of such counsel unless:
(1) the Indemnifying Party has failed to adequately assume and actively
conduct the defense of such Claim or to employ counsel with respect thereto;
or (2) in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, a conflict of
interest exists between the interests of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party that requires representation by separate counsel, in which
case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) If the conditions of _Section 7.6(a)_ are not satisfied (including if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume and control the defense of any
Claim), the Indemnified Party may assume the exclusive right to defend,
compromise or settle such Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound
by any determination of a Claim so defended or any compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party will not be
required to obtain any consent of the Indemnifying Party to the determination
of such Claim (and will not prejudice its right to be indemnified with
respect to such Claim by settling such Claim) if the Indemnifying Party is
asserting that it has no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim. 

(d) The party that shall control the defense of any such Third Party Claim
(the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall select counsel, contractors and
consultants of recognized standing and competence after consultation with the
other party and shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim. Parent or the Representative (on behalf
of the Sellers), as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and representatives to, cooperate fully with the Controlling Party
in the defense of any Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request)
the provision to the Indemnifying Party of the records and information that
are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employee available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, and to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided in connection
therewith, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

7.7 _Escrow._ As security for the obligations of Sellers under this _Article
VII_ , and to provide a source of reimbursement and indemnification to the
Buyer Parties, on the Closing Date, Buyers shall deliver to Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, a national banking association, as agent to Buyers and
Sellers (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), in immediately available funds, to the
account(s) designated by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "), an
amount or amounts in cash equal in the aggregate to the Escrow Amount, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
which will be executed at the Closing, by and among Parent, the
Representative and the Escrow Agent substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Any payment Sellers are obligated
to make to any of the

 



58  Buyer Parties pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be paid first, to the
extent there are sufficient funds in the Escrow Account, by release of funds
to the Buyer Parties from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall accordingly reduce
the Escrow Amount and, second, to the extent the Escrow Amount is insufficient
to pay any remaining sums due, then Sellers shall be required, on a joint and
several basis, to pay all of such additional sums due and owing to the Buyer
Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five Business
Days after a "final determination" of a Loss and the Sellers liability
therefor. On the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release the Escrow Amount to Sellers, except that the Escrow Agent
shall retain an amount (up to the lesser of (x) the Escrow Amount and (y) the
total amount then held by the Escrow Agent) equal to the aggregate of the
Claim Amounts in respect of any claims for indemnification under this _Article
VII_ asserted prior to the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date but
not yet resolved (" _Unresolved Claims_ "). The portion of the Escrow Amount
retained for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the
extent not utilized to pay the Buyer Parties for any such claims resolved
in favor of the Buyer Parties) upon their resolution in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All fees and expenses owed to the Escrow
Agent in connection with the Escrow Agreement shall be paid on the Closing
Date by Buyers. For purposes of this _Section 7.7_, a "final determination"
shall exist when (i) Parent and the Representative have reached an agreement
in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final
and non-appealable order or judgment, or (iii) an arbitration or like panel
shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to
disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto.

 

7.8 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Liability for Taxes_. Sellers shall be liable for all Taxes (including,
specifically, for this purpose, Taxes that are due with respect to Tax returns
that are required to be filed by the Company for the taxable period ended on
or before the Closing Date) of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to any and all periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the
Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Date Period_ ") and for all claims, losses,
liabilities, obligations, damages, impositions, assessments, demands,
judgments, settlements, costs and expenses with respect to such Taxes
(including Taxes arising as a result of the §338(g) Election or the
§338(h)(10) Election). Buyers shall be liable for Taxes of the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any and all periods, or portions
thereof, beginning after the Closing Date (" _Post-Closing Date Period_ ")
and for any and all claims, losses, liabilities, obligations, damages,
impositions, assessments, demands, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses
with respect to such Taxes. Any and all transactions or events contemplated
by this Agreement that occur at or prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed
to have occurred in the Pre-Closing Date Periods.

(b) _Allocation of Liability for Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes that are
attributable to a taxable period which begins before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Date Period shall be determined as follows:

 



59 (i) In the case of ad valorem Taxes and franchise or similar Taxes imposed on
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries based on capital (including net
worth or long-term debt) or the number of shares of stock authorized, issued
or outstanding, the portion attributable to the Pre-Closing Date Period shall
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Date
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period; provided, however, the amount of tax attributable to the Pre-
Closing Date Period shall not exceed the amount of Tax the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries would have paid if its taxable period ended immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) In the case of all other Taxes, the portion attributable to the Pre-
Closing Date Period shall be determined on the basis of an interim closing of
the books of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date, and the determination of the hypothetical Tax for such Pre-Closing Date
Period shall be determined on the basis of such interim closing of the books,
without annualization. The hypothetical Tax for any period shall in no case be
less than zero ($0). Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Date Period shall
be determined under the same method of accounting used by the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries during that period.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all Taxes of the
Sellers, the Companies and/or the Company Subsidiaries attributable to an
election made pursuant to _Section 1.9_ shall be allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

 

(c) _Administration of Tax Matters_. Sellers shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, for the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries,
with reasonable assistance of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, Tax
returns that are required by Law to be filed in respect of Pre-Closing Date
Periods, including, but not limited to, federal income tax returns and
profits tax returns. Sellers shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to filing
such Tax Return(s), provide a copy of such Tax return(s) to Buyers. Buyers
shall, within ten (10) days of receiving such Tax return(s), advise Sellers
regarding any matters in such Tax return(s) that it considers detrimental to
Buyers and/or the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, and with which it
disagrees. In such case, Sellers and Buyers shall reasonably cooperate with
each other to reach a timely and mutually satisfactory solution to the
disputed matters. Without limiting the foregoing or any right of the Buyer
Parties under this _Article VII_ , Sellers and Buyers acknowledge and agree
that any reasonable positions, subject to applicable Laws, taken by Skagen US
Sellers based upon the Geneva Corporate Finance Evaluation of Skagen US and
Skagen Designs, A/S, dated as of February 5, 2001 shall be reasonably
acceptable to Sellers and Buyers. Sellers shall provide to Buyers a copy of
all such Tax return(s) together with the work papers and schedules utilized in
their preparation. Buyers, the Companies and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the filing of Tax
returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
and Tax returns. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the
other partys request) the provision, of records and information which are
reasonably relevant

 



60  to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder; provided that the party
requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable out-or-pocket expenses incurred
by the party providing such assistance; and provided further that no party
shall be required to provide assistance at times or in amounts that would
interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of such party. Buyers
agree to retain all books and records, with respect to tax matters pertinent
to the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-
Closing Date Periods, and to any tax periods beginning before the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date, until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations or extensions thereof. Buyers, the Companies and
Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in
connection with the filing of Tax returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax returns. In respect of Pre-Closing
Date Periods, the provisions of  _Section 7.6_ shall apply, including but
not limited to Sellers ability to elect to be the Controlling Party. With
respect to any such matters for which Sellers elect to be the Controlling
Party, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyers
a timely and mutually satisfactory solution to such disputed matters.

 

(d) _Amended Tax Returns_. Sellers may not file any amended Tax returns or
refund claims in respect of any taxable period of the Company ending on or
prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyers, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

ARTICLE VIII

NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT

 

8.1 _Noncompetition_.

(a) In consideration of the purchase of the Purchased Stock (and the goodwill
associated therewith) and the Business, each Seller covenants to Buyers that,
for a period of three years from the Closing Date (the " _Non-Competition
Period_ "), without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may be
withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent), neither any Seller
nor any Affiliate of any Seller shall, directly or indirectly (in any
capacity, including as a shareholder, partner, member, investor, lender,
principal, director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of any other
Person): (i) engage in, manage, operate, control, participate in the
ownership or have any financial interest in any other Person that engages in,
the business of developing, processing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing
or selling any product or service that competes with, is related to or is in
any way associated with the Business as conducted by the Companies at and
during the 24-month period immediately preceding the Closing (each such
product or service, a " _Competing Product/Service_ "); (ii) solicit or
knowingly influence, or attempt to solicit or influence, any customer or any
reasonably potential customer of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries at
or during the 24-month period immediately preceding the Closing, or any Person
that is, or within the 24-month period preceding the Closing Date was, a
distributor, wholesale account, travel retail

 



61  account or any other non-direct retail purchaser of products or services
from any Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, to purchase a
Competing Product/Service from any Person other than Buyers or their
Affiliates; or (iii) employ, or recruit or solicit for employment, any
employee of any Company or any Company Subsidiary who was at or during the
24-month period immediately preceding the Closing an employee of any
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(b) _Exception_. It will not be a violation of the restrictive covenant
set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ for any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller
to:

(i) invest in or own publicly-traded equity or debt securities constituting
less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding securities of such class;

(ii) invest in or own equity interests in a privately-held debt or equity
investment fund if; provided that (1) the equity interests held by such Seller
or its Affiliates collectively represent less than one percent (1%) of the
outstanding equity interests in such fund and (2) such Seller and its
Affiliates do not have the ability to control or exercise any managerial
influence over such fund; or

 

(iii) place general advertisements that may be targeted to a particular
geographic or technical area but that are not specifically targeted toward
employees of the Companies or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) _Equitable Relief_. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyers would
be irreparably harmed by any violation of the restrictive covenant set forth
in _Section 8.1(a)_ and that, in addition to all other rights and remedies
available to Buyers at law or in equity, Buyers shall be entitled to
injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or enjoin any such violation.
If any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller violates _Section 8.1(a)_, the
period of time during which the provisions thereof are applicable shall
automatically be extended for a period of time equal to the time that such
violation began until such violation permanently ceases.

 

(d) _Representations_. Each Seller represents to Buyers that such Seller is
willing and able to engage in businesses that are not restricted pursuant to
this _Section 8.1_ and that enforcement of the restrictive covenant set forth
in this _Section 8.1_ will not be unduly burdensome to such Seller. Each
Seller acknowledges that such Sellers agreement to the restrictive covenant
set forth in this _Section 8.1_ is a material inducement and condition to
Buyers willingness to enter into this Agreement and the other Buyer
Documents, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Each Seller acknowledges
and agrees that the restrictive covenant and remedies set forth in this
_Section 8.1_ are reasonable as to time, geographic area and scope of
activity and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect
the goodwill and legitimate business interests of the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries, Buyers and their respective Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Business).

 



62 (e) _Court Modification_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the restrictive
covenant set forth in this _Section 8.1_ is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to contain limitations as to time, geographic area or scope of
activity that are not reasonable or not necessary to protect the goodwill
or legitimate business interests of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries,
Buyers and their respective Affiliates and the Business, then such court is
hereby authorized and directed to reform such provisions to the minimum extent
necessary to cause the limitations contained in this _Section 8.1_ as to
time, geographical area and scope of activity to be reasonable and to impose a
restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill and
legitimate business interests of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries,
Buyer and their respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Business). Each Seller acknowledges that Buyers and their Affiliates have a
global presence and an international market and therefore have need of a
global geographic restriction.

(f) _No Defense to Enforcement_. Any alleged breach, claim or cause of action
by any Seller against any Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Buyer or their
respective Affiliates for any reason (other than the obligation to pay the
Sellers the Purchase Price) shall not constitute a defense to enforcement
of the restrictions or covenants set forth in this _Article VIII_ and shall
not be used to deny injunctive or monetary relief.

 

ARTICLE IX

9.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing, as

Adverse Change and (ii) such breach or Material Adverse Change, as applicable,

Agreement if any Buyer is, at such time, in material breach of this
Agreement;

(b) by the Representative if (i) there is a material breach of any warranty,
representation, covenant or obligation of the Buyers such that, if not cured
on or prior to the Closing Date, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_

all material respect within twenty calendar days after written notice thereof

such time, in material breach of this Agreement;

 



63 (c) by the mutual written consent of the Buyers and the Representative; or 

(d) by either Buyers or the Representative if a condition to performance by

breach of this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of a condition to the Closing to be satisfied.

9.2 _Termination Procedures_. If Parent wishes to terminate this Agreement

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, all rights, remedies and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate and be void and of no further force and effect;

subject to the applicable provisions set forth in this _Section 9.3_ and
_Article X_ of this Agreement;

 

(b) the parties shall, in all events, remain bound by the terms and provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement; and 

(c) the parties shall, in all events, remain liable for any liabilities
related to any breach of this Agreement and all legal remedies of the other
parties in respect of any such breach shall survive such termination
unimpaired; _provided_ , that the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, shall only be entitled to receive the actual expenses, fees
and costs incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions with respect to any claim for any Liabilities
arising out of or related to such breach of this Agreement by any Seller or
any Buyer, respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that the immediately
preceding clause and limitation on damages shall not apply to any Liabilities
arising out of, related to or in connection with the willful and knowing
breach of this Agreement, which shall be uncapped.

10.2 _Attorneys  Fees and Costs_. If attorneys fees or other costs are
incurred to secure performance of any obligations hereunder, or to establish
damages for the breach thereof or to obtain any other appropriate relief,
whether by way of prosecution or defense, the Prevailing Party (as defined
below) will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs
incurred in connection therewith. A party will be considered the " _Prevailing
Party_ " if: (a) it initiated the litigation and substantially obtained the
relief it sought, either through a judgment or the losing partys voluntary
action before trial or judgment; (b) the other party withdraws its action
without substantially obtaining the relief it sought; or (c) it did not
initiate the litigation and judgment is entered into for any party, but
without substantially granting the relief sought by the initiating party or

transactions contemplated hereby.

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf)) for

10.5  _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and will not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. 

 



65 10.6 _Severability_. Subject to _Section 8.1(e)_ the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, each of
which will remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in a manner materially adverse to any party.

10.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any member of the
Seller Group or Buyers without the prior written consent of Buyers or the
Representative, as applicable, and any purported assignment or delegation in
violation hereof will be null and void; except that any Buyer may assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent or to any direct or indirect successor to all or
substantially all of the assets or business of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement

parties hereto, and to the extent provided in _Article VII_ , the
Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties.

10.8 _Entire Agreement, Amendment_. This Agreement, the Related Agreements and
the related documents contained as Exhibits and Schedules (as the same may be

agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. All
statements of Sellers contained in any schedule (as the same may be
supplemented as provided herein), certificate or other writing required under
this Agreement to be delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will constitute representations and warranties of Sellers
under this Agreement. The Exhibits, Schedules (as the same may
be supplemented as provided herein) and recitals to this Agreement are hereby
incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Agreement for all
purposes. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified, and any
provision hereof may be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement is
sought.

10.9 _Specific Performance, Remedies Not Exclusive_. The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements
and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all required actions
on its part necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will
cause irreparable injury to the other parties for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations
hereunder. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, no right or
remedy described or provided in this Agreement is intended to be exclusive or
to preclude a party from pursuing other rights and remedies to the extent
available under this Agreement, at law or in equity. Parent hereby guarantees
to the Sellers, the due and punctual observance, performance and discharge of
the payment obligations of each of Fossil Europe and Fossil HK with respect to
the portion of the Cash Purchase Price (subject to adjustment pursuant to

66 10.10 _Appointment of Representative as Sellers  Attorney-in-Fact_. Each

resubstitution, to take any action for each such Seller and in such Sellers
name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, including in connection
with _Article VI_ and _Article VII_ and _Section 9.1_ and _Section 10.7_. If
Charlotte K. Jorst or any successor to Charlotte K. Jorst is, for any reason,
unable or unwilling to act or continue to act as the Representative, then
Sellers will promptly appoint another individual to act as successor
hereunder, and promptly notify Buyers of such appointment. Any notice given to
the Representative pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 10.10_ will
be deemed for all purposes to be notice to each Seller. Without limiting the
other provisions of this _Section 10.10_, with respect to the indemnification
obligations set forth in _Article VII_ , the Representative is hereby fully
empowered to determine in its sole and absolute discretion the terms and
conditions of any settlement of a Claim and any document, agreement or
instrument that the Representative may execute pursuant hereto. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that any such action taken or document executed by the
Representative in accordance with this Agreement will be binding on each
Seller and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the powers and authority granted to the
Representative are coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable and remain
in full force and effect until the expiration of the indemnification
obligations set forth herein.

 

10.11 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS RULE OR PRINCIPLE THAT MIGHT
RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

10.12 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. Any action or other proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of or based on any right arising out of, this
Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in the courts of the
State of Texas, County of Dallas or, if such party has or can acquire
jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas, and each of the parties consents to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of such court(s) (and of the appropriate appellate
courts) in any such action or other proceeding and waives any objection to
venue and jurisdiction laid therein. Process in any action or other proceeding
referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party anywhere in
the world.

10.13 _Drafting_. Neither this Agreement nor any provision contained in this
Agreement will be interpreted in favor of or against any party hereto because
such party or its legal counsel drafted this Agreement or such provision. The
parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty, and
covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If any party
hereto has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein
in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that such party has not breached will not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty, or covenant.

 



67 10.14 _Usage_. Whenever the plural form of a word is used in this Agreement,
that word will include the singular form of that word. Whenever the singular
form of a word is used in this Agreement, that word will include the plural
form of that word. The term "or" will not be interpreted as excluding any of
the items described.

investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that
except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, no
party nor any other Person on behalf of any such party makes, or has made, any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to (i) the
Seller Group or the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) Parent or its Subsidiaries or
(iii) the Contemplated Transactions, as the case may be.

each of the parties hereto that each of the members of the Seller Group has
retained Fenwick and West LLP (" _F andW_") to act as its counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that FandW has not acted as
counsel for any other party in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that none of the other parties has the status of a client of FandW
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Each Buyer
and each of the Companies hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between any Seller and Parent (and its Affiliates,
including the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries), FandW may represent the
Sellers in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers may be
directly adverse to the Buyers, the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, and even though FandW formerly may have represented the Companies
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to
such dispute.
