ARTICLE II \- SALE OF STOCK AND PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 Purchase Price.

(a) In exchange for the Company Shares being sold pursuant to Section 2.2,
Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
Purchase Price, which amount shall be payable as follows:

(i) The Buyer shall pay to each Shareholder, by wire transfer of immediately
available cleared funds to such accounts as may be designated by such
Shareholder (at least three Business Days prior to Closing), such
Shareholder's respective portion of the Closing Date Purchase Price, without
any interest thereon, as set forth opposite such Shareholder's name on
Schedule A hereto under the heading "Closing Consideration". Buyer shall
initiate all irrevocable wire transfers and other payments on the Closing Date
and shall provide reasonably satisfactory evidence to the Shareholders'
Representative that such wires and payments have been irrevocably initiated.

(ii) The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be payable by Buyer to the Escrow
Agent, and the Indemnification Escrow Amount plus any interest accrued thereon
shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the terms of the Escrow Agreement in a
separate account for purposes of the payment to Buyer in satisfaction of any
indemnification or other claims of any Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party required
by Article IX, if any such payment is required under the terms of this
Agreement.

(iii) The Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be payable by Buyer to the
Escrow Agent, and the Working Capital Escrow Amount plus any interest accrued
thereon shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the terms of the Escrow
Agreement in a 

separate account for purposes of the payment to (A) Buyer of the Final Closing
Amount Shortfall or (B) the Principal Shareholder if the Final Closing Amount
is greater than the Estimated Closing Amount, in each case if any payment is
required by Section 2.6(b)(iii) hereof.

(iv) The Shareholders' Representative Reimbursement Amount shall be payable by
Buyer to an escrow agent, and the Shareholders' Representative Reimbursement
Amount plus any interest accrued thereon shall be held by the said escrow
agent under the terms of an escrow agreement (the "Shareholders'
Representative Escrow Agreement" and together with the Escrow Agreement, the
"Escrow Agreements") to be entered into by the Shareholders and the
Shareholders' Representative on the Closing Date for purposes of carrying out
its duties as set forth in Section 9.6 hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer and the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise
payable hereunder to each Shareholder, such amounts as may be required by
applicable Law to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted by Buyer or the Company hereunder,
such amounts withheld or deducted shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect
of which such withholding or deduction was made.

Section 2.2 Transfer of Company Shares. At the Closing, each Shareholder shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer the duly signed transfer orders of
such Shareholder's Company Shares for the purpose of article R228-10 of the
French Commercial Code and the up-to-date security transfer register
("registre des mouvements de titres") with the shareholders accounts ("comptes
individuels d\'associes") of the Company evidencing full transfer to the Buyer
effective as at Closing of all such Company Shares, in exchange for such
Shareholder's respective portion of the Closing Date Purchase Price, payable
in accordance with Section 2.1 to effect a valid transfer of such Company
Shares by the Shareholder, free and clear of any and all Liens. Subject to the
effective payment of the Closing Date Purchase Price, each Shareholder by
execution of this Agreement hereby appoints each of Parent and Buyer as such
Shareholder's attorney-in-fact to effectuate transfer of the Company Shares at
the Closing.

Section 2.3 Closing. The closing of the transactions set forth herein (the
"Closing") shall occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than
the third Business Day) after all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII
shall have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to
the benefit of the same (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing), and, subject to the foregoing, shall take
place at such time and on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing
Date"); provided, however, that the parties agree to employ reasonable best
efforts to effect the Closing on October 2, 2017 (it being understood and
agreed that no party shall be required to waive any condition set forth in
Article VIII or otherwise incur any liability if Closing does not occur on or
prior to such date). The Closing shall take place via the exchange of
documents and signatures in portable document file (PDF) format, delivery of a
written document evidencing the irrevocable payment of the Closing Date
Purchase Price and delivery of the original of the up-to-date security
transfer register ("registre des mouvements de titres") with the shareholders
accounts ("comptes individuels d\'associes"). 

Section 2.4 Tax Matters. Any transfer Taxes, fees and duties under applicable
Law incurred in connection with the sale and transfer of the Company Shares
under this Agreement (including the French stamp duty (droit d'enregistrement)
to be paid to the French Tax authority pursuant to article 726 of the French
Tax Code) (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") will be borne and paid by Buyer.

Section 2.5 Payments for Company Transaction Expenses. With respect to any
Company Transaction Expenses that remain unpaid on the Closing Date or that
will remain unpaid after the Closing, the Company shall submit to Parent
reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the amounts of all such
unpaid Company Transaction Expenses (including the identity of each recipient,
euro and dollar amounts, wire instructions and any other information necessary
for Parent to effect the final payment in full thereof) and indicating that
upon receipt of such amounts that all such Company Transaction Expenses shall
have been paid in full (the "Payoff Instructions"). The Company hereby agrees
that Parent and Buyer shall not be responsible or liable to pay any Company
Transaction Expenses that are not identified in the Payoff Instructions.

Section 2.6 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Preparation of Estimates.

(i) The Company shall prepare in good faith and, at least two (2) days prior
to the Closing Date, deliver to Parent a certificate, signed by the President
of the Company (the "Estimated Closing Statement"), setting forth (A) an
estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company Group, as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, reflecting thereon the Company's best estimate
of all consolidated balance sheet items of the Company Group (the "Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet"), (B) the Working Capital as of the close of business
on the Closing Date based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet ("Estimated
Working Capital"), (C) the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company Group
immediately prior to the Closing based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
("Estimated Cash Amount"), (D) the estimated amount of Indebtedness for
Borrowed Money outstanding as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Indebtedness for Borrowed Money Outstanding at the Closing"),
(E) the estimated amount of Prepaid Income Taxes (the "Estimated Prepaid
Income Taxes"), and (F) the estimated amount of Accrued Income Taxes (the
"Estimated Accrued Income Taxes"), in each case, along with reasonable
supporting detail to evidence the calculation of such amount and calculated
using the Exchange Rate in effect on the date of delivery of the Estimated
Closing Statement. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with IFRS, consistently applied (except no footnotes shall be
required), and using the same IFRS accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies that were used to prepare the Financial Statements.
An illustrative example of the calculation of Estimated Working Capital is set
forth in Schedule 2.6(a)(i).

(ii) Following receipt of the Estimated Closing Statement, the Company shall
permit Parent and its representatives at all reasonable times and upon
reasonable 

notice to review the Company Group's working papers relating to the Estimated
Closing Statement as well as all of the Company Group's accounting books and
records relating to the determination of the items contained therein, and the
Company shall make reasonably available its representatives responsible for
the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of Parent. Prior to Closing, the parties shall discuss in
good faith the computation of any of the items on the Estimated Closing
Statement.

(b) Preparation of Final Closing Statement.

(i) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Principal Shareholder a
statement (the "Initial Closing Statement") setting forth (A) a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company Group as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, reflecting thereon Parent's best estimate of the same consolidated
balance sheet items of the Company Group (and using the same IFRS accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies that were used to prepare
the Financial Statements) as included on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
but adjusted to take into account the final balances as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (B) the Working
Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date based on the Closing
Balance Sheet, (C) the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company Group
immediately prior to the Closing based on the Closing Balance Sheet (the
"Closing Cash Amount"), (D) the amount of Indebtedness for Borrowed Money
outstanding as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money Outstanding at the Closing"), (E) the amount
of Prepaid Income Taxes (the "Closing Prepaid Income Taxes") and (F) the
amount of Accrued Income Taxes (the "Closing Accrued Income Taxes") in each
case, along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculation of
such amount, and calculated using the Exchange Rate in effect on the Closing
Date.

(ii) If the Principal Shareholder disagrees with the Initial Closing
Statement, the Principal Shareholder may, within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof, notify Parent in writing (the "Dispute Notice"), which
Dispute Notice shall provide reasonable detail of the nature of each disputed
item on the Initial Closing Statement, including all supporting documentation
thereto, and the Principal Shareholder shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items and amounts contained in the Initial Closing Statement delivered
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b). Parent and the Principal Shareholder shall
first use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute between
themselves and, if Parent and the Principal Shareholder are able to resolve
such dispute, the Initial Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed the "Final Closing
Statement" and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Principal Shareholder,
Parent and Buyer and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If Parent and
the Principal Shareholder are unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen
(15) days after receipt by Parent of the Dispute Notice, either Parent and/or
the Principal Shareholder shall submit the dispute to EY - Ernst and Young
(Paris Office) (the "Accountants"). The Accountants shall act as experts and
not arbiters and shall 

determine only those items that remain in dispute on the Initial Closing
Statement. Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after engagement, the
Accountants shall deliver a written report to Parent and the Principal
Shareholder as to the resolution of the disputed items. The Initial Closing
Statement as determined by the Accountants shall be deemed the "Final Closing
Statement," shall be conclusive and binding upon the Principal Shareholder,
Parent and Buyer and shall not be subject to dispute or review. The fees and
expenses of the Accountants in connection with the resolution of disputes
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall be paid by (A) the Principal
Shareholder, if Parent's calculation of the portion of the items in dispute is
closer to the Accountants' determination than the Principal Shareholder's
calculation thereof, (B) by Parent, if the reverse is true or (C) except as
provided in clauses (A) or (B) above, equally by the Principal Shareholder and
Parent. Parent and the Principal Shareholder agree that they will, and agree
to cause their respective representatives and independent accountants to,
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Initial Closing Statement and
in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section 2.6(b),
including, without limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of
books, records, work papers and personnel. Unless the Principal Shareholder
delivers the Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Initial Closing Statement, such Initial Closing Statement shall be deemed the
"Final Closing Statement," shall be binding upon the Principal Shareholder,
Parent and Buyer and shall not be subject to dispute or review.

(iii) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted, dollar for dollar, up or down, as
appropriate, to the extent that (A) the Working Capital set forth on the Final
Closing Statement, plus the Closing Cash Amount set forth on the Final Closing
Statement, minus the Closing Indebtedness for Borrowed Money Outstanding at
the Closing set forth on the Final Closing Statement, plus the Closing Prepaid
Income Taxes set forth on the Final Closing Statement, minus the Closing
Accrued Income Taxes set forth on the Final Closing Statement (collectively,
the "Final Closing Amount") is greater than or less than (B) the Estimated
Working Capital, plus the Estimated Cash Amount, minus the Estimated
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money Outstanding at the Closing, plus the Estimated
Prepaid Income Taxes, minus the Estimated Accrued Income Taxes (collectively,
the "Estimated Closing Amount"), as applicable. Within five (5) Business Days
following determination of the Final Closing Amount, if the Final Closing
Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Amount, Buyer and the Principal
Shareholder shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the
Working Capital Escrow Fund an amount equal to the difference between such
amounts (the "Final Closing Amount Shortfall"). In the event that the Final
Closing Amount Shortfall exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the
Principal Shareholder shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such difference
within five (5) Business Days following determination of the Final Closing
Amount. Shall the Principal Shareholder fail to make such payment, Buyer and
the Shareholders' Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to pay
to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Fund an amount equal to such
difference within five (5) Business Days following determination of the Final
Closing Amount. In the event that the Working Capital Escrow Amount exceeds
the Final Closing Amount Shortfall, Buyer and the Principal Shareholder shall
jointly direct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the 

Principal Shareholder (as part of the Purchase Price owed to the Principal
Shareholder) from the Working Capital Escrow Fund an amount equal to such
difference. Within five (5) Business Days following determination of the Final
Closing Amount in accordance with this Section 2.6(b)(iii), if the Final
Closing Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Amount, (A) Buyer shall
deliver to the Principal Shareholder (as part of the Purchase Price owed to
the Principal Shareholder) an amount equal to the Final Closing Amount minus
the Estimated Closing Amount and (B) Buyer and the Principal Shareholder shall
jointly direct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Principal Shareholder (as
part of the Purchase Price owed to the Principal Shareholder) all amounts in
the Working Capital Escrow Fund. Any payments made pursuant to this Section
2.6(b)(iii) shall be made in U.S. dollars at the Exchange Rate in effect on
the Closing Date.

OF THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the disclosure schedule dated
as of the date of this Agreement and delivered herewith by the Company and the

"Applicable Article III Provision") (or disclosed in any other section,
subsection or clause of the Agreement (including the Schedules); provided,
that it is readily apparent on its face, upon a reading of the disclosure
without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the
matter disclosed, that such disclosure is responsive to the Applicable Article

and warrants to each of Parent and Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date) as follows:

any event or otherwise. As of the date of this Agreement, each member of the
Company Group is in good standing and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such

Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the bylaws and of the certificates of
incorporation or equivalent organizational documents of each member of the
Company Group, each as in effect as of the date hereof and made available to
Parent's and Buyer's counsel, are complete and correct, and except as set
forth in Schedule 3.1(a), no amendments thereto are pending.

(b) The Company has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to
consummate the transactions and perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the 

Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party, the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Company Board"), as applicable. No other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to approve and authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent, Buyer, the Shareholders and the Shareholders' Representative,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms.

Section 3.2 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of the capital shares
set forth on Schedule 3.2(a), which are all issued and outstanding and owned
by the Shareholders as set forth on Schedule 3.2(a).

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(b), none of the outstanding Company
Shares are subject to, nor were they issued in violation of, any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, first offer, co-sale or
participation, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a), no shares of voting or non‑voting
capital stock, other equity interests or other voting securities of the
Company are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All outstanding
Company Shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except for
the Company Shares, there are no bonds, debentures, notes, other Indebtedness
or any other securities of the Company with voting rights on any matters on
which shareholders may vote. As of the date of this Agreement, no dividends
are declared and unpaid.

(c) There are no outstanding securities, options, warrants, calls, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities or Contracts or obligations of any kind
(contingent or otherwise) to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound obligating the Company, directly or indirectly, to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company or obligating the Company to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call,
right, Contract or obligation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(c), there
are no outstanding obligations of the Company (contingent or otherwise) to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of
capital stock (or options or warrants to acquire any such shares) of the
Company. There are no stock-appreciation rights, stock-based performance

Section 3.4 No Conflict; Consents. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions in accordance with the terms hereof, do not
(i) violate, conflict with or result in the payment or any penalty or in a
default (whether after the giving of notice, lapse of time or both) under, or
give rise to a right of termination of, any Contract, to which a member of the

Section 3.5 Financial Statements.

(a) The Company has made available to Parent and Buyer true and complete
copies of the following financial statements, including any related footnotes,
copies of which are attached hereto as Schedule 3.5 (collectively, the
"Financial Statements"):

(i) Audited consolidated accounts of the Company Group for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and audited accounts of the Company and each Subsidiary for
the year ended December 31, 2016, in each case as set forth on Schedule
3.5(a)(i); and

(ii) Unaudited consolidated accounts of the Company Group for the three months
ended March 31, 2017, which shall include a consolidated balance sheet as of
March 31, 2017 (the "Base Balance Sheet"); provided, however, that the Base
Balance Sheet is subject to normal year-end adjustments and does not contain
footnotes.

(b) The Financial Statements (including all notes thereto) (i) present a true
and fair representation (image sincere et fidele) of the financial position,
assets and liabilities and results of operations of the Company Group (or the
applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be) as of the dates and for the periods
indicated therein and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS consistently
applied throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each other, (ii)
present fairly and accurately the consolidated financial condition, balance
sheet, statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows of the
Company Group (or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be) as of the
dates and for the periods indicated therein and (iii) are consistent with the
books and records of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary (which, in turn,
are accurate and complete in all material respects). Since December 31, 2016,
there has been no event, occurrence, change, effect or condition of any
character that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company Group maintains accurate books and records reflecting its
assets and liabilities and maintains proper and adequate internal control over
financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are executed and access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization; (ii) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with IFRS, consistently applied, and to maintain asset
accountability; (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company Group's assets;
(iv) the recorded accountability for Company Group assets is compared with the
existing Company Group assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action
is taken with respect to any difference and (v) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory were recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. There have been no instances of fraud by the Company Group, any
officer or director of the Company Group, or any other Person involved in the
preparation of the Financial Statements, whether or not material, that
occurred during any period covered by the Financial Statements. None of the
Company Group nor any director or officer, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any employee, accountant or auditor of the Company Group, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices and procedures of the Company Group or its respective
internal accounting controls. 

(d) The relevant auditors have issued unqualified audit reports in respect of
each of the audited Financial Statements. The Company Group has not withheld
any information from the auditors, which, if disclosed, would have caused the
auditors to qualify their audit report or to refuse to issue their report with
respect to any of the audited Financial Statements. No auditor to the Company
or any Subsidiary has ever declined or indicated its inability to issue an
opinion with respect to any financial statements of the Company or any
Subsidiary.

(e) The Company is not a party to, nor has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand or any off balance sheet
arrangements, where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company Group's financial statements.

(f) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(f) and for Indebtedness and
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money, as reflected in the Financial Statements, no
member of the Company Group has any Indebtedness (other than any such
Indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business between the date
hereof and the Closing Date) or and Indebtedness for Borrowed Money
outstanding as of the date hereof. No member of the Company Group is in
default with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness for Borrowed Money or any
instrument relating thereto, nor is there any event which, with the passage of
time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a default, and no such
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money or any instrument or agreement relating
thereto purports to limit the issuance of any securities by the Company or the
operation of the Business. Complete and correct copies of all instruments
(including all amendments, supplements, waivers and consents) relating to any
Indebtedness or Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been furnished to Parent and Buyer.

the Company or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such

Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.7 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, there is, and
since June 1, 2014, there has been, no litigation, action, suit, proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
threatened against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, any of the
Company's or any of the Subsidiaries' properties or any of their respective
employees in their capacity as such. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, no

Section 3.8 Taxes.

(a) Each member of the Company Group has duly and timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by such member. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material 

respects and were prepared in substantial compliance with all applicable Laws
and regulations. All Taxes due and owing by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid when due.
No member of the Company Group is currently the beneficiary of any extension
of time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been received
by the Company Group in writing from any Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where any member of the Company Group does not file Tax Returns
that such member is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There

the assets of any member of the Company Group.

employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party.

(c) No federal, state, local, or foreign tax audits or administrative or
judicial Tax proceedings are pending or being conducted with respect to any
member of the Company Group. No member of the Company Group has received from
any Tax authority (including jurisdictions where such member has not filed Tax
Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review,
(ii) request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or
assessed by any Tax authority against such member. Schedule 3.8 lists all
federal, state, and local income Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns
filed with respect to the Company Group since January 1, 2014, indicates those
Tax Returns that have been audited, and indicates those Tax Returns that
currently are the subject of audit. The Company has delivered to Parent and
Buyer correct and complete copies of all national or U.S. federal and material
state and local income Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by each member of the Company Group
in connection with any taxable periods ending on or after January 1, 2014.

(d) No member of the Company Group has waived any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency.

(e) The unpaid Taxes of the Company Group did not, as of the date of the Base
Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for actual Taxes (as opposed to any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) as shown on the Base Balance Sheet, and will not exceed such
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the reasonable past custom and practices of the Company Group
in filing Tax Returns. No member of the Company Group will incur any liability
for Taxes from the date of the Base Balance Sheet through the Closing Date
other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with reasonable
past practices.

income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any:

(i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date; 

(ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date;

(iii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date; or

(iv) any similar election, action, or agreement that would have the effect of
deferring any liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from any period ending on or before the Closing Date to any period ending
after such date.

(g) No member of the Company Group is a party to or a member of any joint
venture, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other arrangement or
contract which could be treated as a partnership for Tax purposes.

(h) Each member of the Company Group uses the accrual method of accounting for
Tax purposes.

(i) Each member of the Company Group has at all times complied with its
obligations in terms of custody of documents as provided by applicable Laws
and is in the position to justify the assessment and payment of any Taxes or

representative of another Person (other than another member of the Company
Group) for Tax purposes.

compliance with applicable Laws and regulations and is and has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable Laws and
regulations and with its terms. (ii) No litigation or governmental
administrative proceeding, audit or other proceeding (other than those
relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Program or any

there is no reasonable basis for any such litigation or proceeding. (iii) All
payments and/or contributions required to have been made with respect to all
Company Employee Programs either have been made or have been accrued in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Employee Program and
applicable Law.

(c) None of the Company Employee Programs provides health care or any other
non-pension benefits to any employees after their employment is terminated
(other than as required by applicable Law), and the Company has never promised
to provide such post-termination benefits. 

(d) (i) Each Company Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or otherwise
modified by the Company Group to the greatest extent permitted by applicable
Law, including the elimination of any and all future benefit accruals
thereunder, and no employee communications or provision of any Company
Employee Program has failed to effectively reserve the right of the Company
Group to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Company Employee
Program. (ii) No member of the Company Group has announced its intention to
modify or terminate any Company Employee Program or adopt any arrangement or
program which, once established, would come within the definition of a Company
Employee Program. (iii) Each asset held under each Company Employee Program
may be liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee,
surrender charge or comparable liability.

(e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the accelerated vesting,
payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any shareholder, employee, officer, director or other
service provider of any member of the Company Group; (ii) limit the right of
any member of the Company Group to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Company Employee Program or related trust; or

a Company Employee Program funded through a trust, or any other funding
vehicle, each reference to such Employee Program shall include a reference to
such trust, organization or other vehicle.

(ii) An entity "maintains" an Employee Program if such entity sponsors,
contributes to, or provides benefits under or through such Employee Program,
or has any obligation to contribute to or provide benefits under or through
such Employee Program, or if such Employee Program provides benefits to or
otherwise covers any current or former employee, officer or director of such
entity (or their spouses, dependents, or beneficiaries).

restrictive covenants and any similar encumbrances that individually or in the

the Company Group to use such property or assets in the conduct of the
businesses currently conducted thereat). None of the Owned Real Property is
subject to any first refusal, purchase option, right to purchase or other
similar right. To the knowledge of the Company, all improvements located on
the Owned Real Property have received all necessary approvals of Governmental
Authorities (including licenses and permits) required in connection with the
use thereof. There are no judicial or administrative actions or proceedings
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened in writing under any
condemnation, environmental, zoning, eminent domain, land-use or other Law
applicable to the Owned Real Property which, if adversely decided, would
interfere with the present use in the Business of the Owned Real Property. No

claim, arbitration or investigation pending or, to the actual knowledge of the
senior management of 

Parent, threatened, against Parent or Buyer, and neither Parent nor Buyer is
subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Authority that, in either case, would be reasonably likely,

copies of all Tax Returns, reports and information statements that are filed
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date. The Company
shall timely and correctly file all Tax Returns required to be filed on or

with respect to such Tax Claim). No failure or delay of Parent or the Company
in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations or liabilities of the Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement,
except to the extent that such failure precludes the Shareholders or any
member of the Company Group from defending against any liability or claim for
Taxes that the Shareholders are obligated to pay hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the 

contrary, including Section 9.3, Parent shall control the conduct and
resolution of any Tax Claim, provided that (w) Shareholders' Representative
will be entitled to participate fully in the defense of such Tax Claim at the

purpose at the Shareholders' expense, (x) Parent and the Company Group shall
provide Shareholders' Representative with copies of all written communications
relating to the Tax Claim, (y) Parent and the Company shall keep Shareholders'
Representative informed regarding the progress of any Tax Claim and consult

Tax Claim if such Tax Claim relates to Taxes for which the Shareholders are
liable under this Agreement and (z) Parent and the Company shall not settle or
otherwise resolve any Tax Claim (or any issue raised with respect to such Tax
Claim) if such settlement or other resolution relates to Taxes for which
Shareholders are liable under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Shareholders' Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt (but not in
limitation of other reasonable bases for the failure of the Shareholders'
Representative to consent to a proposed settlement or resolution of a
particular Tax Claim), the failure of the Shareholders' Representative to
consent to any proposed settlement or resolution that would result in a
payment to a Governmental Authority for which the Shareholders would be liable
for indemnification under Article IX in preference to a bona fide written
alternative proposed settlement or resolution that would result in a payment
to such Governmental Authority of an equal or lesser amount for which the
Shareholders would not be liable for indemnification under Article IX shall be
deemed reasonable.

Section 7.6 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event (such occurrence or
nonoccurrence, a "Pre-Closing Adverse Change") that results in the breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company herein such
that any closing condition contained in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) would not
be satisfied (assuming that the Closing were to occur at such time). Upon
notification of the occurrence of any Pre-Closing Adverse Change that is based
on an event that occurs after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer may, at
its option, either (i) terminate this Agreement without any further obligation
or liability of any party hereto to the others as a result of such termination
or (ii) waive the closing condition or conditions that would not be satisfied
as a result of such Pre-Closing Adverse Change (so long as such waiver would
not cause the Closing to violate applicable Law), in which case the breach
resulting from such occurrence or nonoccurrence shall be deemed not to give
rise to any Losses indemnifiable under Article IX hereof.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company of the occurrence or non‑occurrence of any event that results in the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent herein
such that any closing condition contained in Sections 8.3(a) and 8.3(b) would
not be satisfied (assuming that the Closing were to occur at such time);
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.6(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the
Company hereunder.

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Company and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the authorization, license, permit, consent, waiver or
approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated 

hereby or thereby, (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and
(iii) any claim relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
that relates to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any fact, event, change, development, circumstance or effect
occurring after the date hereof (or of which it became aware after the date
hereof) that has had or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and Buyer shall give prompt notice
to the Company of any fact, event, change, development, circumstance or effect
occurring after the date hereof (or of which it became aware after the date
hereof) that has had or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 7.7 Employee Matters/Corporate Directors. The members of the Company
Group and the Shareholders shall, and shall cause each of their respective
agents and representatives to, subject to the prior written approval of Denis
Guyennot (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), take all actions that may be reasonably requested by Parent, at
Parent's expense, with such request directed to the Persons set forth on
Schedule 7.7 prior to the Closing Date with respect to prospective changes to
the employment status of any employees, consultants or other agents of any
member of the Company Group. Parent and/or Buyer shall offer terms of
employment or consulting arrangements to the individuals set forth on Schedule
7.7, on the terms set forth on Schedule 7.7, in each case subject to Closing.

Section 7.8 Interested Party Transactions. Except as set forth on Schedule
7.8, prior to the Closing, the Company Group shall have taken all actions
necessary to terminate, and shall cause to be terminated effective as of the
Closing, the Contracts, transactions and any other arrangements all as set
forth in Schedule 3.19, in each case without any further liability or
obligation of the Company Group.

Section 7.9 Further Action. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken
promptly, all appropriate action, promptly do, or cause to be promptly done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and execute
and promptly deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to cause all conditions to the
obligations of the other parties hereto to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby to be satisfied, to obtain all necessary waivers,
consents, approvals and other documents required to be delivered hereunder and
to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any
injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by
this Agreement. 

Section 7.10 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall
cooperate with Parent to effect the replacement of the corporate officers and
corporate directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as set forth
in Schedule 7.10 with corporate directors and corporate officers appointed by
Parent at Parent's expense, to the extent possible under local Laws, as of the
Closing. Provided that Parent shall have provided the Company with reasonable
advance notice of the identity of the persons to be appointed in replacement,
the Company shall obtain the written resignations of the said corporate
officers and corporate directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
effective as of the date of their effective replacement by officers and
directors appointed by Parent.

Section 7.11 Financial Statements.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event prior to the Closing,
the Company shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered,
to Parent the historical financial information set forth on Schedule 7.11(a),
which represents the information that Parent has determined may be required to
be audited and filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant to Item 9.01 of the
Current Report on Form 8‑K as contemplated by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder as such required financial information
is modified by any relief granted to Parent by the SEC with respect to the
scope of financial information required to be filed together with an audit
opinion thereon from the Audit Accountants (as defined herein) in the form
required by the SEC and applicable stock exchange, all of which shall be in
English (the "Historical Financial Information"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Closing Date is within twenty (20) days of the end of a
fiscal period of the Company, the Company shall deliver the financial
information set forth on Schedule 7.11(a) for that fiscal period as soon as
possible following Closing, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days
following Closing. The Company covenants that the Historical Financial
Information will be prepared in accordance with either (i) U.S. Generally
Accepted Auditing Standards or (ii) standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, in either case as of the dates and for the periods indicated.
The Company will also cooperate in all reasonable respects with the applicable
accounting firm (the "Audit Accountants") in connection with this audit of the
Historical Financial Information. The Company, Buyer and Parent further
covenant that the costs of the preparation, review and audit of the Historical
Financial Information shall be borne by Parent.

(b) The Company will cooperate in all reasonable respects with Parent in
Parent's preparation of the pro forma financial information relating to the
acquisition required pursuant to Item 9.01 of the Current Report on Form 8-K
as contemplated by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Pro Forma Financial Information," and together with the
Historical Financial Information, the "Required Financial Information"),
providing reasonable access to such of the Company's personnel, advisors and
accountants as may be necessary to prepare such Pro Forma Financial
Information, and generally cooperating with Parent's reasonable requests in
order to facilitate such preparation.

(c) The parties further acknowledge that the foregoing financial information
must be filed by Parent with the SEC under cover of an amendment to a Current
Report on Form 8-K not less than seventy one (71) calendar days after the
initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, which initial filing must
be filed by Parent with the SEC not less than four (4) days (as calculated
under the SEC's rules and regulations) after the Closing Date. Accordingly,
time is of the essence with respect to the 

observance of this covenant. The parties also acknowledge that any Parent
filings under the Securities Act that require the Required Financial
Information also necessitate timely cooperation, including cooperation in the
performance of incremental audit procedures necessary, by the Company to
facilitate the execution and filing of an accountant's consent. The Company
covenants and agrees to promptly cooperate from and after the Closing Date to
facilitate such actions and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Audit Accountants to perform such procedures and deliver any such consent
from time to time as requested by Parent.

Section 7.12 Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.

(a) Non-Competition. During the thirty-month period beginning on the Closing
Date (the "Non-Compete Period"), in order to maintain and preserve the fair
market value of the Company Shares, neither the Shareholders nor the Regional
Managers shall, nor shall authorize any of their respective Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, engage (whether as an owner, operator, manager,
employee, officer, director, consultant, advisor, representative or otherwise)
anywhere in the world in any business or activities that the Company or any
Subsidiary conducts as of the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
distributing and reselling consumer products of Parent; provided that
ownership of less than 2% of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded
corporation shall not be deemed to be engaging solely by reason thereof in any
of such business or activities. The Shareholders, Regional Managers and Buyer
confirm that no amount or consideration is received or receivable by the
Shareholders or Regional Managers for granting the non-competition covenants
provided herein (the "Non-Compete").

(b) Non-Solicitation. Each Shareholder and Regional Manager agrees that,
during the Non-Compete Period, without the prior written consent of Parent,
such Shareholder or Regional Manager shall not, and shall not authorize any of
his or its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly:

(i) contact, approach or solicit for the purpose of offering employment to or
hiring (whether as an employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or
otherwise) or actually hire any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or
of Parent or Buyer and their Affiliates introduced to such Shareholder or
Regional Manager in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder;

(ii) solicit or attempt to induce any customer or other business relation of
Parent or Buyer into any business relationship which might materially harm the
Company or any Subsidiary or Parent or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, or to divert any such customer or business relation to any other
entity or Person; or

(iii) disparage the Company, any Subsidiary, Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
principals or employees.

(c) Confidential Information. Each Shareholder and Regional Manager shall
treat and hold as confidential any information concerning the business and
affairs of the Company and the Subsidiaries that is transferred hereby that is
not already generally available to the public, including any notes, analyses,
compilations, studies, forecasts, interpretations or other documents that are
derived from, contain, reflect or are based upon any such information (the
"Confidential Information"), refrain from using any of the Confidential
Information except in connection with this Agreement, and deliver promptly 

to Buyer, at the request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and
all copies) of the Confidential Information which are in his or its possession
or under his or its control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential
Information shall not include information that is (i) generally available to
the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.12(c) or other
act or omission of any Shareholder or Regional Manager or (ii) rightfully
received after the Closing Date from a third party not under any obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such information. In the event that any
Shareholder or Regional Manager is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, administrative demand or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Person shall notify
Buyer promptly of the request or requirement. If any Shareholder or Regional
Manager is compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal
or else stand liable for contempt, such Person may disclose the Confidential
Information to the tribunal; provided that such disclosing Person shall use
its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer, an order or other
assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

(d) Remedy; Enforcement; Acknowledgement. Each Shareholder and Regional
Manager acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach by it or him (or
any of its or his Affiliates) of any of the provisions of this Section 7.12,
monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in
the event of any such breach and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer and/or Parent and/or their successors or assigns may,
in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any
court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance
and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions hereof, in each case without the requirement of
posting a bond or proving actual damages. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section
7.12 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed. Each Shareholder and
Regional Manager acknowledges and agrees that (i) the restrictions contained
in this Section 7.12 are reasonable in all respects (including, without
limitation, with respect to the subject matter, time period and geographical
area) and are necessary to protect Buyer's and Parent's interests in, and
value of, the Company and the Subsidiaries, (ii) the Shareholders and Regional
Managers are primarily responsible for the creation of such value, and (iii)
Buyer and Parent would not have consummated the transactions contemplated
hereby without the restrictions contained in this Section 7.12.

Section 7.13 Sale of Robot-Advance Business. The parties agree that the
Company Group may sell the Robot-Advance Business at or prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that the consideration paid for such sale shall only be
cash.

Section 7.14 Share Transfer. The Company shall carry out, prior to Closing,
the repurchase of its shares held by Garibaldi Participations through a
capital reduction followed by a cancellation of said shares in compliance with
French laws and in accordance with the shareholders' decisions dated July 13,
2017 and attached to this Agreement as Schedule 7.14(a) (the "Garibaldi Buy-
Back"). The Shareholders hereby approve the Garibaldi Buy-Back and 

undertake to take all necessary steps and corporate decisions to complete the
Garibaldi Buy-Back. Should the Garibaldi Buy-Back not be completed prior to
Closing, for any reason whatsoever, the Principal Shareholder hereby
irrevocably grants the right to the Buyer to exercise the Garibaldi Call
Option in place of the Principal Shareholder, in accordance with article 8
(faculte de substitution) of the Garibaldi Call Option. The Principal
Shareholder hereby agrees not to transfer the Garibaldi Call Option to any
party other than Buyer. Further, the Principal Shareholder hereby agrees not
to transfer or exercise the rights of the Principal Shareholder set forth in
the agreements set forth on Schedule 7.14(b).

Agreement, the representations and warranties of the Parent, Buyer,
Shareholders and the Company contained herein, as the case may be, shall
survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until 11:59 pm
(Boston time) on the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the

representations and warranties of the Company and the Shareholders made
pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.15, (ii) the representations and
warranties of the Shareholders made pursuant to Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and

parties contained in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely or for such

that for such covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter period,
breaches thereof shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted

Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnification may be
sought under this Article IX shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if notice of the

shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnification may be
sought prior to such time.

boards or representatives (each a "Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party") to the
extent of any Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred or sustained
by any of the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties, as the same are incurred,
arising out of, relating to, resulting from, or in whole or in part sustained
in connection with:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or the

Article IX for any Loss to the extent included in the determination and the
calculation of the Purchase Price at Closing.

(b) The Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties' indemnification rights pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) shall be limited as follows:

(i) The Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i), Section 9.2(a)(iii) or Section
9.2(a)(x) until the aggregate dollar amount of all such Losses that would
otherwise be indemnifiable equals or exceeds US$300,000 (the "Threshold"), at
which time the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification of all Losses in excess of the first US$300,000 that would
otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i), Section 9.2(a)(iii)
and Section 9.2 (a)(x).

(ii) The Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to seek

provided that the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ix) for any amount of
indemnifiable Losses in excess of US$10,000,000. Subject to Section 9.5, the
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek indemnification
for any amount of indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Agreement resulting
from a breach of any Fundamental Representations in excess of the Purchase
Price.

(iv) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising from a breach of
or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the
parties in this Agreement but not for purposes of determining whether any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation has been breached or is
inaccurate, limitations or 

qualifications as to dollar amount, materiality or Material Adverse Effect set
forth in such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation shall be
disregarded.

(v) No indemnification shall be payable to a Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party
(i) with respect to claims asserted by such Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(a)(iii) after Indemnification
Cut-Off Date or (ii) pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii) and Sections 9.2(a)(iv) --
(xi) after the end of the applicable survival period in accordance with
Section 9.1.

(vi) The Parent/Buyer Indemnified Parties shall first seek satisfaction for
any Losses for which indemnification is available hereunder under Section
9.2(a) solely out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, until all funds held in
the Indemnification Escrow Fund have been exhausted.

(vii) The amount of Losses payable under this Article IX shall be reduced by
any and all amounts actually recovered by the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party
and/or the Company Group under applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person responsible therefor (net of any expenses incurred by such Parent/Buyer
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount). If the Parent/Buyer Indemnified
Party and/or the Company Group actually receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person responsible for any indemnified
Losses subsequent to an indemnification payment therefor pursuant to this
Article IX, then such Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly pay such
amounts to the Shareholders up to such amounts actually received by the
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party and/or the Company Group, net of any expenses
incurred by such Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party in collecting such amounts.

(viii) The Shareholders shall not be held liable for indemnification under
this Article IX to the extent the Loss for which indemnification is sought is
(i) directly and solely the result of any voluntary action on the part of the
Buyer and/or Parent and/or their Affiliates after the Closing Date or (ii)
attributable to any change in accounting methods (including consolidation
methods) enacted following the Closing Date or the Company Group's compliance
(in accordance with applicable Law) with the covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement.

(ix) The Shareholders shall not be held liable for indemnification under this
Article IX in respect of any breach of representation or warranty which would
not have occurred but for any Law passed after the date of this Agreement.

(x) Any indemnification due by the Shareholders under this Article IX shall in
all cases be limited to the amount of the Loss, notwithstanding the fact that
the event giving rise to the Shareholders' obligation may originate from an
inaccuracy of several of the representations made under Article III and/or
Article IV of this Agreement.

(xi) Any deficiency assessed by a Tax authority the sole effect of which is to
shift a Tax liability from one fiscal year to another shall give rise to
indemnification by the 

Shareholders under this Article IX only insofar as any member of the Company
Group is required to pay a penalty or interest charge in relation thereto.

(xii) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article
IX shall be calculated net of any Loss Tax Benefit actually realized by a
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party and/or any member of the Company Group in the
year of the Losses giving rise to such indemnification claim.

(xiii) If a claim is based upon a liability that is contingent only, no
indemnification shall be due under this Article IX unless and until such
liability becomes due and payable.

(xiv) If a claim relates to a payment being owed by the Company Group, the
Shareholders will only be liable under this Article IX once the corresponding
payment is due and has actually been made by the Company Group.

(xv) If any loss accrual set forth on Schedule 9.2(b)(xv) is settled for an
amount less than the corresponding loss accrual included in the Closing
Balance Sheet, the difference shall be set off against the indemnification
obligations of the Shareholders under this Article IX.

Section 9.3 Procedures.

(a) General. Promptly after the discovery by any Parent/Buyer Indemnified
Party of any Loss or Losses, claim or breach, including any Tax Claim or any
claim by a third Person (a "Third-Party Claim"), that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Shareholders'
Representative a certificate (a "Claim Certificate") that:

(i) states that the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party has paid or properly
accrued Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur liability
for Losses, for which such Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

(ii) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable and available,
each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the basis for
any anticipated liability, all available evidence and the nature of the
misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or claim
to which each such item is related and, to the extent computable, the
computation of the amount to which such Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party claims
to be entitled hereunder; provided, that, subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 9.1, no delay on the part of any Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party in
notifying the Shareholders' Representative shall relieve any Shareholder of
any liability or obligations hereunder except to the extent that such
Shareholder has been prejudiced thereby, and then only to such extent.

(b) Objection. If the Shareholders' Representative objects to the
indemnification of a Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or
claims specified in any Claim Certificate, the Shareholders' Representative
shall deliver a written notice specifying in reasonable detail the basis for 

such objection to the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Shareholders' Representative of such Claim Certificate.
Thereafter, the Shareholders' Representative and the Parent/Buyer Indemnified
Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties for a period of not less than sixty (60) days after receipt by the
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party of such written objection with respect to each
of such claims to which the Shareholders' Representative has objected. If the
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party and the Shareholders' Representative agree with
respect to any of such claims, the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party and the
Shareholders' Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum
setting forth such agreement and, if applicable, an instruction to the Escrow
Agent. Should the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party and the Shareholders'
Representative fail to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or
amounts within such sixty (60) day period, then either party shall be entitled
to pursue its available remedies for resolving its claim for indemnification.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Parent/Buyer Indemnified
Party seeks recovery against the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the time
periods set forth herein shall run concurrently with and be without
duplication of the time periods set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party Defense; Settlement. The Parent/Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of any Third-Party Claim; provided, however, (w) that the
Shareholders' Representative will be entitled to participate fully in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim at the expense of the Shareholders, and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at the Shareholders' expense,
(x) that the Shareholders' Representative shall have the right to request and
receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
the Third-Party Claim, except to the extent that receipt of such documents
would, in the good faith opinion of Parent (after consultation with outside
counsel), adversely affect any privilege relating to any Parent/Buyer
Indemnified Party, (y) that Parent and the Company shall keep the
Shareholders' Representative informed regarding the progress of any Third-
Party Claim, and (z) that any settlement of any such Third-Party Claim shall
be effected with the prior written consent of the Shareholders'
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, but if such consent is unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed then such consent shall not be required; provided further, however,
that the Shareholders' Representative shall have the right to conduct the
defense of the matter set forth on Schedule 9.3(c). If any such action or
claim is so settled or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any
such action, the Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of any Loss relating thereto. For the avoidance
of doubt (but not in limitation of other reasonable bases for the failure of
the Shareholders' Representative to consent to a proposed settlement or
resolution of a particular Third-Party Claim), the failure of the
Shareholders' Representative to consent to any proposed settlement or
resolution that would result in a payment to a third party pursuant to such
Third-Party Claim for which the Shareholders would be liable for
indemnification under this Article IX in preference to a bona fide written
alternative proposed settlement or resolution that would result in a payment
to such third party of an equal or lesser amount for which the Shareholders
would not be liable for indemnification under this Article IX shall be deemed
reasonable.

(d) Shareholders' Representative Defense; Settlement. In the event the
Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party elects not to defend the Third-Party Claim and
with respect to the matter set forth on Schedule 9.3(c), the Shareholders'
Representative may defend such claim at the Shareholders' sole cost and
expense. In such event, the Shareholders' Representative shall not have any
right to settle, adjust or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the
express written consent of the Parent/Buyer Indemnified 

Party against whom the Third-Party Claim has been asserted, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, but if such
consent is unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed then such consent
shall not be required; provided, however, that the Shareholders'
Representative shall have the right to settle the matter set forth on Schedule
9.3(c) as set forth therein.

(e) Agreed Claims. Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to
which the Shareholders' Representative did not object in writing within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a
memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 9.3(b) and claims
for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of a final
non-appealable resolution by arbitration or of a final non-appealable judicial
determination are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Agreed Claims."
The Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed
Claim within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the amount of any
such Agreed Claims.

Section 9.4 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All payments made pursuant to
this Article IX shall be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for Tax
purposes, and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement.

Section 9.5 Remedies Exclusive. Parent and Buyer agree that, following the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any matters
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall be the rights to indemnification
set forth in this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the limitations set forth in this Article IX
shall not apply with respect to fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, in no event shall the liability of the
Shareholders with respect to this Agreement exceed the excess of the Purchase
Price over the aggregate amount of any other indemnification payments made by
the Shareholders under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Agreement (including without limitation this Section 9.5) shall preclude
the Company (prior to the Closing), or Shareholders' Representative, Parent or
Buyer from pursuing any and all remedies it may have in Law or at equity with
respect to any claims that they have against any other Party hereto (other
than, with respect to Parent and Buyer, claims for money damages).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event that any of the Persons listed on Schedule 9.5 are unable to satisfy any
of such Person's indemnification obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the
liability for such indemnification obligations shall be joint and several as
set forth on Schedule 9.5.

Section 9.6 Shareholders' Representative.

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, each Shareholder hereby
initially appoints, as of the date hereof, the Principal Shareholder as the
Shareholders' Representative. The Shareholders' Representative shall have full
power and authority to take all actions under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreements that are to be taken by the Shareholders' Representative. The
Shareholders' Representative shall take any and all actions which he, she or
it believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreements, including, without limitation, executing the Escrow Agreements as
Shareholders' Representative, giving and receiving any notice or instruction
permitted or 

required under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements by the Shareholders'
Representative, interpreting all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreements, making payments, authorizing payments to be made
with respect hereto or thereto, obtaining reimbursement as provided for herein
for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses and other obligations of or incurred
by the Shareholders' Representative in connection with this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreements, defending all claims arising pursuant to Section 2.6 (a
"Working Capital Claim"), defending all indemnity claims against the Escrow
Amount pursuant to Section 9.2 (an "Indemnity Claim"), consenting to,
compromising or settling all Indemnity Claims, conducting negotiations with
Parent, Buyer and their respective agents regarding such claims, dealing with
Parent, Buyer and the Escrow Agent under this Agreement, taking any and all
other actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreements, and engaging counsel, accountants or other representatives in
connection with the foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Shareholders' Representative shall have the full power and
authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreements and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof in his,
her or its capacity as Shareholders' Representative.

(b) The Company, the Shareholders, Parent and Buyer each hereby authorizes the
Shareholders' Representative to:

(i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to Shareholders'
Representative pursuant hereto or to the Escrow Agreements or in connection
herewith or therewith and to receive and accept services of legal process in
connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreements;

(ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the Shareholders'
Representative may in his or her sole discretion deem appropriate;

(iii) After the Closing, take such action as the Shareholders' Representative
may in his, her or its sole discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (A)
waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Parent or
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by Parent or
Buyer pursuant hereto; (B) taking such other action as the Shareholders'
Representative is authorized to take under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreements; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making all
determinations, in their capacity as Shareholders' Representative, required
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements; and (D) all such actions as may
be necessary to carry out any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreements, including, without limitation, the
defense and/or settlement of any claims for which indemnification is sought
pursuant to this Article IX and any waiver of any obligation of Parent or
Buyer.

(c) The Shareholders' Representative shall have no duties to the Shareholders
or liability to the Shareholders with respect to any action taken, decision
made or instruction given by the Shareholders' Representative in connection
with the Escrow Agreements or this Agreement. 

(d) The Shareholders' Representative shall, if applicable, be indemnified by
the Shareholders for and shall be held harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred by the Shareholders' Representative or any of his or her
Affiliates and any of their respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, shareholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants,
advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in each case
relating to such Shareholders' Representative's conduct as Shareholders'
Representative, other than losses, liabilities or expenses resulting from such
Shareholders' Representative's willful misconduct in connection with its
performance under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements. This
indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The costs of
such indemnification (including the costs and expenses of enforcing this right
of indemnification) shall, when applicable, be paid by the Shareholders. The
Shareholders' Representative may, in all questions arising under this
Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Shareholders' Representative in accordance with
such advice, the Shareholders' Representative shall not be liable to the
Shareholders or the Escrow Agent or any other person. In no event shall the
Shareholders' Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith for
(i) any indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages, or (ii) any
amounts other than those that are satisfied out of the Escrow Amount.

(e) The Shareholders' Representative shall have reasonable access to
information of and concerning any Working Capital Claim and/or any Indemnity
Claim and which is in the possession, custody or control of Parent or Buyer or
Company Group and the reasonable assistance of Parent's, the Buyer's and the
Company Group's officers and employees for purposes of performing the
Shareholders' Representative's duties under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreements and exercising its rights under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreements, including for the purpose of evaluating any Indemnity Claim
against the Indemnification Escrow Fund and any Working Capital Claim against
the Working Capital Escrow Fund; provided that the Shareholders'
Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except in connection with
enforcing its rights under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements, disclose
any nonpublic information from or concerning any Indemnity Claim or any
Working Capital Claim to anyone (except to the Shareholders' Representative's
attorneys, accountants or other advisers, to Shareholders and on a need-to-
know basis to other individuals who agree to keep such information
confidential).

(f) In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Shareholders'
Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or instrument
reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any
Shareholder or any party hereunder and (ii) assume that any Person purporting
to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so.

(g) Each Shareholder acknowledges that Parent and Buyer are relying and shall
rely on the authority of the Shareholder granted hereunder and will be
materially prejudiced if this authority is revoked. Each Shareholder hereby
agrees that it shall indemnify, hold harmless, compensate and reimburse Parent
and each other Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party for any Losses suffered by
Parent or any other Parent/Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of a revocation
by such Shareholder of the authority granted hereunder other than as provided
for herein.

(h) Subject to Section 9.6(g), the appointment of the Shareholders'
Representative hereunder is irrevocable, and any action taken by the
Shareholders' Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Section
9.6 shall be effective and absolutely binding as the action of the
Shareholders' Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements. 

Section 9.7 Tax Refunds. The Shareholders shall be entitled to any Tax refunds
(or credits in lieu of refunds) that are received by the Parent/Buyer
Indemnified Parties and/or their Affiliates (including the Company Group on or
after the Closing Date) attributable to Pre-Closing Taxes paid by any member
of the Company Group. Parent shall pay over to the Shareholders'
Representative, or as directed by the Shareholders' Representative, any such
refund (or credit in lieu of refund) within thirty (30) Business Days after
receipt of such refund (or credit in lieu of such refund). After the Closing,
Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall work together in good faith
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to diligently prosecute any Tax
refund claims in order to legally maximize and obtain any such Tax refunds or
credits. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall request, and
shall cause the relevant member of the Company Group to request, a refund
(rather than a credit in lieu of refund) with respect to all Pre-Closing Taxes

ARTICLE X \- TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent (on behalf of itself and Buyer)
and the Company and the Shareholders' Representative;

(b) by either of the Company or the Shareholders' Representative, on the one
hand, or Parent or Buyer, on the other hand, by written notice to the other:

(i) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued
an injunction or taken any other action (which injunction or other action the
parties hereto shall use their best efforts to lift) that permanently
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, and such injunction shall have become final and non-
appealable; or

(ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to 5:00 pm (Boston time) on
October 31, 2017; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to comply with any material provision of this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date.

(c) by the Company and the Shareholders' Representative, if the Company is not
then in material breach of any material term of this Agreement, upon written
notice to Parent, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of Parent or Buyer contained in this Agreement, provided that such
breach is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30)
days after the giving of written notice thereof by the Company to Parent, such
that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.3 cannot be satisfied or
cured prior to the date set forth in Section 10.1(b)(ii); or

(d) by Parent or Buyer if neither Parent nor Buyer is then in material breach
of any material term of this Agreement, upon written notice to the Company,
upon a material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the
Company contained in this Agreement, provided that such 

breach is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30)
days after the giving of written notice thereof by Parent or Buyer to the
Company, such that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 cannot be
satisfied or cured prior to the date set forth in Section 10.1(b)(ii).

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Parent,
Buyer or the Company Group and their respective directors, members of the
Company Board, officers, employees, partners, members, shareholders or
advisors and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease,
except for the agreements contained in this Section 10.2 and Article XI;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 10.2 shall relieve
any party from breaches of this Agreement on account of fraud or willful
misconduct in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

Section 10.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or
extension is to be enforced. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement
by a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
waiver of the same term or condition by such party, or a waiver of any other
term or condition of this Agreement by such party.

Section 11.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the preamble,
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and any documents executed by the parties
simultaneously herewith or pursuant thereto, constitute the entire agreement
of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 11.3 Assignment. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties.

Section 11.4 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be
affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed
to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually 

acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.5 No Agreement Until Executed. Irrespective of negotiations among
the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding among the parties hereto unless and until this
Agreement is executed by the parties hereto.

Section 11.6 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article or
Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms used herein with initial capital letters have the meanings ascribed
to them herein and all terms defined in this Agreement will have such defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein, or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein, means
such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by

successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns.

Section 11.7 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, Parent (on behalf of Parent and Buyer), on the one
hand, and the Company and the Shareholders, on the other hand, shall bear
its/his own expenses in connection with the negotiation and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, the fees, costs and
expenses of third parties incurred by the Company Group set forth in Schedule
11.7 shall be fully reimbursed by Parent and/or Buyer no later than thirty
(30) days following the date of termination of this Agreement.

Section 11.8 Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction. All disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its rules of
conflict of laws. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and of the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in each case, located in the
City of Boston, Massachusetts (the "Chosen Courts") for any litigation arising 

out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and
agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts),
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the
Chosen Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of
the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise
subject to service of process in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as such party's
agent for acceptance of legal process and (b) that service of process may also
be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing
receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of
valid service. Service made pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above shall have
the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within

Section 11.9 Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have
been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby
who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the
parties do not intend that the presumptions of Laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage could occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that Parent, Buyer and
Shareholders (including the Shareholders' Representative) shall be entitled to

at Law or equity.

Section 11.11 Miscellaneous. This Agreement (a) shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder and (b) may be executed in two or more counterparts which
together shall constitute a single agreement. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
