 Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company: 

   

 (a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Rollover Shares acquired by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Equity Rollover Commitments) shall automatically be cancelled, and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect therefor. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Share_ ") (other than shares cancelled pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $11.75 (the " _Per Share Consideration_ "), plus the Additional Per Share Consideration, if any, in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and the holders of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.02_ of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock 

   ##### 

   

    

dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(b)_ shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change (including, without limitation, to provide
holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such transaction); _provided,
however,_ that nothing in this _Section 2.01(d)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in  _Section 2.01(b)_, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (it being understood that if such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest). At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. Any payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation (and not by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

  

 Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(b)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash amounts in immediately available funds constituting an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration plus the Total Option Cash Payments (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ") (exclusive of any amounts in respect of Dissenting Shares and Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)_) (such amount as deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(b)_ and _Section 2.03_, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to
make such payment. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Stock
Options, and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to
_Section 2.02(b)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Delivery of Shares_ _._ As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) (i) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 2.04_ hereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Merger Sub and the Company may reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide that at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery); and (ii) to each holder of a Company Stock Option, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 2.03_ hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option. If payment of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration is made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02_ , each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration or Option Cash Payments, as applicable, in cash as contemplated by this _Section 2.02_ or _Section 2.03_ without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) _Surrender of Shares_ _._ Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be solely 

   ##### 

  

    

entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if
so elected by the surrendering holder) as promptly as possible and in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days following the later to occur of
(i) the Effective Time; or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares . Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.02_, each Share (other than
Shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ hereof and any Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration into which the Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.01(b)_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_ _._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Stock Options for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, subject to any and all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_ _._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_ _._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this  _Article II_, and following any losses Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options in the amount of such losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with 

   ##### 

  

    

maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States
of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (g) _Withholding_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, including, to the extent applicable, any payment pursuant to _Section 5.14_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.14_, to the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

   

 (h) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares. 

  

 Section 2.03 _Stock Options and Other Awards_. 

   

 (a) _Company Stock Options_ _._ As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Stock Option whether vested or unvested, shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such Company Stock Option, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment (less applicable withholding taxes and without interest) equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ " and the sum of all such payments, the " _Total Option Cash Payments_ "), except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. As of the Effective Time, except to the extent agreed by Parent, the Company and a holder of a Company Stock Option or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, all Company Stock Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. 

   

 (b) _Restricted Shares_ _._ As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent, the Company and a holder of Restricted Shares with respect to such holders Restricted Shares, and except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, each share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan or an applicable restricted stock agreement (each a " _Restricted Share_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of restriction as of the Effective Time and 

   ##### 

  

    

shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_. 

   

 (c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Effective upon the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all such actions as are necessary and appropriate to provide that (a) participants in the Cumulus Media Inc. 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (b) no offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (c) each ESPP participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the earlier of January 1, 2008 and the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, and (d) the ESPP shall terminate immediately following the purchase of Company Class A Common Stock on such earlier date. As of the Effective Time, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, all outstanding rights to purchase Company Class A Common Stock under the ESPP shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and to the extent an employee has elected not to purchase stock, the employee contributions in respect of such options shall be returned to the holder thereof. 

   

 (d) _Amendments to and Termination of Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, (ii) obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares, and (iii) take any and all other actions, that, in each case, are reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.03(a)_ , _Section 2.03(b)_ and _Section 2.03(c)_, including, without limitation, providing holders of Company Stock Options with notice of their rights with respect to any such Company Stock Options. Without limiting the foregoing the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any person, other than the holders of the capital stock (or equivalents thereof) of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof. 

  

 Section 2.04 _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II._ 

  

 Section 2.05 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_ _._ After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Company, or Persons performing similar functions. The Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the Companys periodic reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
required time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as

evaluations under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company of the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Companys
internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain internal accounting controls

in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (B)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (C)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or

Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the
Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully

   ##### 

  

   

immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause to be returned or destroyed any confidential information provided or
made available to any such Person. Notwithstanding anything contained in
_Section 5.02_ to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an

Company Acquisition Proposal (as such Company Acquisition Proposal may be
revised during the course of ongoing negotiations, in which event it
may temporarily cease to satisfy the requirements of _Sections 5.02(c)(i)_,
_(ii)_  and _(iii)_ , so long as such negotiations are ongoing and there is
not, following the No-Shop Period Start Date, a continuous period of greater
than five Business Days during which it fails to satisfy the requirements of
_Sections 5.02(c)(i)_, _(ii)_ and  _(iii)_ ) fails, in the good faith
judgment of the board of directors of the Company, to satisfy the
requirements of _Sections 5.02(c)(i)_, _(ii)_ and _(iii)_. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.02(b)_, and in addition to the rights of the Company pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_, if at any time after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Merger Approval, (i) the Company has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the board of directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee) believes in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (iii) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Special Committee determines in good faith that the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly provide or make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person which was not previously provided or made available to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.02(b)_ or this _Section 5.02(c)_, after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the Merger Approval, the Company shall in any event be permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to any Excluded Party. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, promptly (within one (1) Business Day) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with notice of the material terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person making any such Company Acquisition Proposal). In addition, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis regarding the status of any such Company Acquisition Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.02(b)_ to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Merger Approval, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Special Committee concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, and, to the extent applicable, after giving effect to any adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (ii) below, the board of directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee) may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the board of directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided, however_ that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ ; _provided, further_ , that neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof may effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless: 

   

 (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (ii) if the notice is given after the No-Shop Period Start Date, then prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, provide a reasonable opportunity to negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub
and to again comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.02(d)_ with
respect to such new written notice, except that the new Notice Period shall
in all events be only three (3) Business Days. 

   

 (e) Any violations of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any of the Contributing Stockholders, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.02_ by the Company. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys board of directors, failure so to disclose could be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law. 

   

Section 5.03 _Company Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Statement_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall (i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") for the purpose of having this Agreement adopted by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with applicable Law as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, (ii) except to the extent that the board of directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, and (iii) except to the extent that the board of directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation.

Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 7.01_, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the SEC Filings so that the SEC Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to the extent required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the Companys stockholders. 

   

 (b) In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company will (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, with respect to

Section 5.04 _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) and benefits, in each case, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than such annual base salary and base wages, incentive compensation opportunities and benefits provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) For all purposes (excluding for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent, its ERISA Affiliates and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (including the Company Benefits Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company, its ERISA Affiliates and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time,  _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent legally permissible, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (c) Upon the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume all Company Benefit Plans that require assumption by a successor to the Company in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 5.04_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan for any purpose, nor shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Company Employees at any time.

restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated
or reversed; and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and other transactions to be
performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 (d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that license renewal applications (each, a " _Renewal Application_ ") may be pending before the FCC with respect to the Company Stations (each, a " _Renewal Station_ "). In order to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Applications and the Divestiture Applications, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prosecute and resolve any issues with respect to pending Renewal Applications.

Parent and the Company agree to make such representations and undertakings as necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to assume the position of applicant with respect to any pending license renewal applications, and to assume the risks relating to such applications.

members of their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date hereof and which has previously been provided to Parent, and shall not, for a period of six years from the date hereof, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all rights to indemnification thereunder in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and Parent shall, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") 

   #####

and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law upon the receipt of any undertaking to the extent required
by DGCL), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether
before or at the Effective Time, including with respect to this Agreement, in
connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other
fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts and otherwise containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than the Companys current policies with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (which annual amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in _Section 5.08(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case where the payment would otherwise exceed such amount shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year pre-paid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Company Charter, the Governing Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability prior to the Effective Time.

The Company shall notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis, of any events or changes with respect to any regulatory investigation or action involving the Company or any of its Affiliates, and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates in efforts to mitigate any adverse consequences to Parent or its Affiliates which may arise (including by coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with regulators).

 (d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee, required pursuant to this  _Section 7.02_ when due, such fee and/or expenses shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee or expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ calculated on a daily basis until the date of actual payment.

 (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that neither the Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Limited Guarantee shall be the sole and 

   ##### 

  

   

exclusive, direct or indirect, remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries

Stockholders, and any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignee of any of the foregoing (each, a "
_Parent Affiliate_ ") for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, including in the event Parent or Merger Sub
breaches its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
obligations under this Agreement, and upon payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investor, any Contributing
Stockholder or any Parent Affiliate shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, (i) in no event shall Parent be required to
pay fees or damages payable pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ on more than one
occasion, (ii) in no event shall Parent have to pay a Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to more than one subsection of this _Section 7.02_ and (iii) in no
event shall Parent and Merger Sub be subject to liability, under this
Agreement in a circumstance not set forth in _Section 7.02_ or _Section
6.04(b)_.
