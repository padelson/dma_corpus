an Italian corporation ("PARENT"), Norma Acquisition Corp., a Washington
corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"),
and Oakley, Inc., a Washington corporation (the "COMPANY").   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement, which contemplates the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, as set forth below (the "MERGER"),
in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "WBCA") and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;  
WHEREAS, upon the consummation of the Merger, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company
(each a "SHARE" and, collectively, the "SHARES") will be converted into the
right to receive $29.30 per share in cash (without interest) (the "MERGER
PRICE"), upon the terms and subject to the limitations and conditions of this
Agreement;   WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, concurrently herewith, James H. Jannard (the "FOUNDER")
has entered into an agreement (the "FOUNDER VOTING AGREEMENT") with Parent
and Merger Sub to vote his Shares in favor of this Agreement and the Merger
on the terms and subject to the conditions specified therein;   WHEREAS, as
a further inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently herewith, the Founder has entered into a non-competition
agreement with Parent and Merger Sub (the "PS NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT"),
effective as of the Effective Time of the Merger, with the rights and
obligations thereunder of Merger Sub to be rights and obligations of
the Surviving Corporation by virtue of the Merger, and on the terms and
subject to the conditions specified therein;   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "BOARD") has approved the terms of the Founder
Voting Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Board is recommending, subject to the terms
hereof, that the Company\'s shareholders approve this Agreement and the
Merger;   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the
Merger;     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:   ARTICLE
I   THE MERGER   Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions hereof, and in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement and the WBCA, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.02), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent.   Section 1.02. Effective Time; Closing. The closing (the "CLOSING")
will be held at the offices of Winston and Strawn LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New
York, New York at 10:00 A.M., New York, New York time, on the fifth business

forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions), or such other place and time as Parent and the
Company may agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE"). On the Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of
merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Washington, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of Washington law. The Merger shall become effective
at such time at which such Articles of Merger shall be duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Washington, or at such later time
reflected in such Articles of Merger as shall be agreed by Parent and the
Company in writing (the time that such Merger becomes effective, the
"EFFECTIVE TIME").   Section 1.03. Effects of the Merger. The effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the WBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.04. Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation.   (a) At the Effective Time, the amended and
restated articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to read in its
entirety as set forth in Exhibit A and, as so amended and restated, shall be
the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable
law.   (b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable
law.   Section 1.05. Directors. Subject to applicable law, the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation or
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.    -2-     Section 1.06.
Officers. Subject to applicable law and any obligation of the Company under
any employment agreement with the relevant person that is in effect as of the
Effective Time, the individuals specified by Parent in writing to the Company
at least two business days prior to the Closing Date shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.07.
Conversion of Shares; Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, which Shares, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall each
be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment being made with
respect thereto and, other than any Shares constituting Dissenting Shares (as
defined below)), shall be converted into and represent the right to receive
in cash the Merger Price from Parent or Merger Sub (through the Paying Agent
as provided in Section 2.01). At the Effective Time, all Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Price as provided in this
Section 1.07 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and
the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Price, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with Article II
hereof.   Section 1.08. Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.09. Dissenting
Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
and to the extent provided under applicable law, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time as to which the holder
takes, or forbears from taking, such actions as required to satisfy the
requirements for perfecting dissenters\' rights set forth in Chapter 23B.13
of the WBCA and has not effectively withdrawn, waived or lost
its dissenters\' rights (the "DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Price. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall
represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the WBCA. If,
after the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares is not entitled to
payment under Chapter 23B.13, then each Dissenting Share owned by such holder
shall be treated as if it had been converted into the    -3-    right
to receive the Merger Price as of the Effective Time. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any written demands for
appraisal under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and any withdrawals of such
demands or any actions or failure to take actions that result in the loss or
waiver of dissenters\' rights, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not settle, offer to settle or make any payment with respect to such
demands unless it receives prior written consent from Parent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or unless it is required to do
so under the WBCA. Any amount payable to any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall be paid in accordance with the WBCA solely by the Surviving Corporation
out of its own funds.   Section 1.10. Company Stock-Based Arrangements.  
(a) Company Options. Subject to Section 2.01(f), at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, all outstanding and unexpired options and similar rights to
acquire Shares (other than Company Stock-Based Awards, as such term is
defined in Section 1.10(b) below), regardless of whether or not such options
or rights have vested (the "COMPANY OPTIONS"), including, without limitation,
Company Options granted pursuant to the Company\'s 1995 Stock Incentive Plan,
as amended (the "1995 STOCK PLAN"), and option agreements with individuals
thereunder (collectively, the "OPTION PLANS"), shall be cancelled and each
holder of a cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, at the
Effective Time, in consideration for the cancellation of each such Company
Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming full vesting of each such Company Option whether or not it has
vested in accordance with its terms) and (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Price over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company
Option, without interest thereon.   (b) Company Stock-Based Awards. Subject
to Section 2.01(f), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, all performance shares,
stock appreciation rights and deferred stock, if any, outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the 1995 Stock Plan that shall not yet have
been replaced by issued Shares upon the lapse of the applicable forfeiture
condition, including, without limitation, all performance units ("LTIP
PERFORMANCE UNITS") outstanding under the LTIP (as defined in Section
5.06(g)) ("COMPANY STOCK-BASED AWARDS"), shall be cancelled.   (c)
Restricted Stock Awards. Any restrictions on each Share ("RESTRICTED SHARE")
issued under the 1995 Stock Plan or under any of the Plans (as defined in
Section 3.13(a) below) or otherwise shall lapse immediately prior to, and
effective upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, and each Restricted
Share shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each
such Restricted Share will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and
have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions (including
the condition set forth in Section 2.01(f)) as, each Share not subject to
any restrictions. All dividend equivalents, if any, credited to the account
of each holder of a Restricted Share as of the Effective Time shall be   
-4-    distributed to the holder of such Restricted Share at the Effective
Time, without interest thereon.   (d) Actions. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Options and Company
Stock-Based Awards appropriate notices, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company shall take all action as is necessary prior to the
Effective Time to terminate all Option Plans (including such actions as are
necessary to amend each Option Plan to cancel the Company Options, Company
Stock-Based Awards and other rights granted pursuant to such Option Plan) so
that at and after the Effective Time, no current or former employee,
director, consultant or other person shall have any option to purchase or
right to receive any Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards for his
or her benefit. Not more than ten nor less than three business days prior to
the anticipated Effective Time, the Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, deliver to Parent a list, in form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of the number of Company Options and Company Stock-
Based Awards expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and the names of the holders thereof and in each case together with the
applicable mailing addresses, tax identification numbers and other
information relating to such holders and participants as Parent may
reasonably require in connection with the payments to be made pursuant to
this Section 1.10. Parent may take such actions, as promptly as practicable,
prior to making any payment under this Section 1.10, as are reasonably
necessary and appropriate in order to verify the right of any person to
receive such a payment hereunder, the identifying information relating
to such person and whether any withholding is required with respect thereto
and, if so, the amount thereof.   ARTICLE II   PAYMENT FOR SHARES  
Section 2.01. Payment for Shares.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, a
bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company shall act
as paying agent (the "PAYING AGENT") in effecting the payment of the Merger
Price in respect of certificates (the "SHARE CERTIFICATES") that, prior to
the Effective Time, represented Shares entitled to payment of the Merger
Price pursuant to Section 1.07. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust
with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Price to which holders of Shares
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.07 plus the
aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.10 in exchange for
Company Options, Company Stock-Based Awards and Restricted Shares (such funds
collectively being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). Parent
shall be obligated to, from time to time, deposit any additional funds
necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Price with respect to Shares
outstanding at the Effective Time.    -5-     (b) Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to, mail to each record holder of Share Certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (other than Share Certificates
representing Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, and other than Dissenting Shares) a form of
letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Share Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Share Certificates to the Paying Agent, and instructions for use in
surrendering such Share Certificates and receiving the aggregate Merger Price
in respect thereof. Upon the surrender of each such Share Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such additional agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Paying Agent, the holder of such Share Certificate shall be paid the
Merger Price multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such
Share Certificate in consideration therefor, and such Share Certificate
shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each such Share
Certificate (other than Share Certificates representing Shares held by
Parent, Merger Sub or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub,
in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, and other than Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right
to receive the aggregate Merger Price relating thereto. No interest or
dividends shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Price. If the Merger Price
(or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any person other than the
person in whose name the Share Certificate formerly representing Shares
surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such right to
receive such Merger Price that the Share Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person surrendering such Share Certificate shall pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Price
to a person other than the registered holder of the Share Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to, mail to the persons entitled to receive such payment, as verified
by Parent pursuant to Section 1.10(d), checks in payment of the consideration
payable to such persons pursuant to Section 1.10 in exchange for Company
Options, Company Stock-Based Awards and Restricted Shares.   (c) Promptly
following the date which is 12 months after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash, Share Certificates
and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions described
in this Agreement, and the Paying Agent\'s duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, each holder of a Share Certificate formerly representing a Share
may surrender such Share Certificate to the Surviving Corporation
and, subject to the applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws,
receive in exchange therefor the aggregate consideration relating thereto,
without any interest or dividends thereon, as provided in this
Agreement.    -6-     (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of any Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Share
Certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be surrendered and cancelled in
exchange for the payment of the aggregate consideration as provided in this
Agreement.   (e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of the Shares, Company
Options, Company Stock-Based Awards or other securities for any consideration
to be paid in the Merger delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (f) Each of the
Company, Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment hereunder to Parent or to any holder
of Shares, Company Options, Company Stock-Based Awards or other securities
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "CODE"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. In the
case of any holder of more than 5% of the Shares who is a "United States
person" for United States federal income tax purposes, such holder shall
deliver, on the Closing Date, a properly executed non-foreign affidavit
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. In the case of any
holder of more than 5% of the Shares who is not a "United States person," for
United States federal income tax purposes, and who acquired its shares on or
after January 1, 2007, the Company shall certify, to the extent it is able to
do so, that it was at no time since January 1, 2007, a United States real
property holding corporation.   (g) If any Share Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Share Certificate, the Merger Price, without any interest
thereon.   (h) The Paying Agent shall invest the funds constituting the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest or other income resulting
from such investment shall be paid to Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.   
-7-     ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  
The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
that, except (i) as set forth in the disclosure schedule dated the date of
this Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and identified as such by the
Company (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") (it being understood that any
information set forth in a particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in each other section or
subsection thereof to which the relevance of such information is reasonably
apparent on its face), (ii) as may be disclosed in any of the SEC Reports (as
defined below) filed prior to the date of this Agreement and publicly
available, excluding any disclosure in any such SEC Report set forth in any
risk factor section and in any section relating to forward-looking statements
other than factual disclosures therein that are set forth elsewhere in such
SEC Report, or (iii) as arising after the date of this Agreement from any
actions taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof
at, and in accordance with, the specific written request of Parent or Merger
Sub:   Section 3.01. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The
Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the State of Washington. Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the percentage of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity interests owned by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, except where
the failure to be so organized, validly existing or in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite
power (corporate or otherwise) and authority to own, operate or lease its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the properties owned,
operated or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to have such power or authority or to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The term "SUBSIDIARY," as used in
this Agreement, means, with respect to any entity, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such entity for
financial reporting purposes. Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and principal line of
business of each Subsidiary of the Company. The term "MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT," as used in this Agreement, means any change or effect that
is or could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except for any such change or effect arising
out of or relating to (i) the announcement of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or actions by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company required to
be taken pursuant to this Agreement or the failure to take any actions that
are prohibited by this Agreement, (ii) changes in general economic,
regulatory or political conditions or changes affecting the economy or the
securities or financial markets in general, except to the extent that any
such change or effect disproportionately affects the Company when compared to
other members of the Company\'s industry, (iii) changes in laws, rules,
regulations or orders of any Governmental Entity (as defined herein) or
interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity or changes in
accounting    -8-    rules, except to the extent that any such change
or effect disproportionately affects the Company when compared to other
members of the Company\'s industry, (iv) changes affecting generally the
industry in which the Company conducts business, except to the extent that
any such change or effect disproportionately affects the Company when
compared to other members of the Company\'s industry, (v) a material
worsening of current conditions caused by an act of terrorism or war (whether
declared or not declared) occurring after the date of this Agreement or any
natural disasters or any national or international calamity affecting the
United States or (vi) any change in the market price or trading volume of the
Company\'s securities, including as a result of the failure of the Company to
meet analysts\' expectations, provided that the exception in this clause (vi)
shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any
cause underlying such change has resulted in or contributed to the occurrence
of a Material Adverse Effect as defined without reference to this clause
(vi).   Section 3.02. Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Company
has heretofore made available to Parent and Merger Sub an accurate and
complete copy of the articles of incorporation or certificate of formation
and the by-laws or operating agreement, or other similar organizational
documents, each as amended to the date hereof, of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company. Such articles of incorporation or certificate of
formation and by-laws or operating agreement or such other organizational
documents are in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of,
and none of its Subsidiaries is in violation in any material respect of, any
provision of its articles of incorporation or certificate of formation or by-
laws or operating agreement, or other similar organizational document.  
Section 3.03. Capitalization. Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth (i) as of the close of business on June 18, 2007 (the "MEASUREMENT
DATE"), the number of authorized and outstanding Shares and the number of
authorized and outstanding shares of preferred stock ("PREFERRED STOCK") of
the Company, (ii) as of the Measurement Date, the number of Shares for which
the Company Options are exercisable and the related exercise prices, (iii)

Based Awards in the form of restricted stock units which have not yet been
replaced by issued Shares, (v) the number of Shares originally made subject
to the 1995 Stock Plan, (vi) the number of Shares that, as of the Measurement
Date, had been issued pursuant to the 1995 Stock Plan and (vii) the number of
Shares that, as of the date of this Agreement, remain issuable pursuant to
the 1995 Stock Plan. The Company\'s procedures with respect to the granting
of all Company Options provided for the specification of an exercise price
that is no less than the market price for the Shares on the date of the
grant. The Company complied in all material respects with such procedures
with respect to the granting of the Company Options. The Founder is the
record and, to the knowledge of the Company, the beneficial owner, as
beneficial ownership is defined in the Exchange Act (as defined below), of
44,426,400 of the outstanding Shares. There are no bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness having general voting rights (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having such rights) ("VOTING DEBT") of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries issued and outstanding. Except for the
Company Options, the Company Stock-Based Awards, and options, subscriptions
or other rights issued and outstanding which are held by the Company or any
Subsidiary in any other Subsidiary and except as set forth in Section 3.03 of
the Company    -9-    Disclosure Schedule, there are no existing
options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character, relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, obligating
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell or cause to
be issued, transferred or sold any shares of capital stock or Voting Debt of,
or other equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, nor are there any obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call,
subscription or other right, agreement, arrangement or commitment. There are
no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any third-party to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Shares or other capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except for the Founder Voting Agreement, to the knowledge of
the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no voting agreements
with respect to the Shares which affect or relate to the voting of, or the
execution of written consents with respect to, or the solicitation of proxies
relating to the voting of, any security of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and
such shares of the Company\'s Subsidiaries are owned, beneficially and of
record, by the Company or by a Subsidiary of the Company, in each case, free
and clear of any Lien, other than Liens imposed by or arising under
applicable law. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make an investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any entity other than a
Subsidiary.   Section 3.04. Authority Relative to this Agreement. Except for
the Required Shareholder Approval (as defined in Section 6.01(a)), the
Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized, approved and declared advisable by the Board and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
or approve this Agreement (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
adoption of this Agreement by holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Shares
and the filing of the Articles of Merger as required by the WBCA). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally, (ii) general principles
of equity and (iii) the remedies of specific performance and injunctive
relief and other forms of equitable relief being subject to the discretion of
the Governmental Entity (as defined below) before which any enforcement
proceeding therefor may be brought. The Board, at a meeting duly called and
held on June 20, 2007, prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
by adopting resolutions that, as of the time of execution and delivery of
this Agreement, are in full force and effect and have not been in any way
modified or rescinded, has duly taken all actions necessary under the WBCA
and the Company\'s articles of incorporation to (a) approve and adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby

fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (c)
direct that this Agreement be submitted to the Company shareholders for
adoption, (d) resolve to recommend that the shareholders of the Company
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (e)
approve the Founder Voting Agreement. As a result of the foregoing actions,
the only vote required to authorize and approve the Merger is the affirmative
vote of the holders of two-thirds of the Shares.   Section 3.05. No
Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (a) Assuming (i) compliance with

requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the

requirements of The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and (vii) the
Consents referred to in Section 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are obtained or made, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, the performance or consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions hereof will (w) conflict with or violate the articles
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable
organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (x) conflict with or
violate any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, injunction or other binding action or requirement of any Governmental
Entity (as defined in Section 3.05(b) below) applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, (y) other than the accelerated
vesting of Company Options, Company Stock-Based Awards and Restricted Shares,
result in a breach or violation of, a default under (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default), or the triggering of
any payment or other obligations to any of the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' present or former employees pursuant to, any of the Company\'s
or any of its Subsidiaries\' existing Employee Benefit Arrangements (as
defined in Section 5.01(f) below) or any grant or award made under any of the
foregoing, or (z) result in a violation or breach of or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in any loss of any benefit under,
or the creation of any Lien on any of the property or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets or properties may be bound or affected, except, with respect to
clauses (x), (y) and (z), as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of the
Merger.    -11-     (b) None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance or consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Company with any of
the provisions hereof will require any consent, waiver, approval,
authorization, order, decree, license, or permit of, or registration or
filing with or notification to (any of the foregoing being a "CONSENT"), any
government or subdivision thereof, domestic, foreign or supranational, or any
administrative, governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission,
tribunal or body, domestic, foreign or supranational (a "GOVERNMENTAL
ENTITY") or any third party, except for (i) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger
pursuant to the WBCA, (iii) compliance with any requirements of the HSR Act
and any requirements of any foreign, supranational or other antitrust or
similar laws, (iv) compliance with the requirements of the NYSE, (v)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1988 Exon-Florio provision
of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, (vi) the Consents referred
to in Section 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (vii) Consents
the failure of which to obtain or make would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) The Board has taken all
actions necessary for the Company to take in order to ensure that the
restrictions applicable to business combinations contained in Chapter 23B.19
of the WBCA are, and will be, inapplicable to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement (such actions by the Board, the "NECESSARY
23B.19 ACTIONS"), including but not limited to ensuring that the Board
approve the significant business transaction before an acquiring person\'s
share acquisition time. No other state takeover statute or similar legal
requirement applies or purports to apply to the Company with respect to the
Agreement or the agreements contemplated herein. No representation is made by
the Company with respect to the application of Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA
or any similar statute as a result of actions by Parent or its affiliates
taken prior to the time that the Board took the Necessary 23B.19 Actions;
provided, however, that, to the Company\'s knowledge, Chapter 23B.19 of the
WBCA will not apply to Parent or its affiliates.   Section 3.06. Compliance
with Agreements. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports (as defined in
Section 3.07(a)) filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict

obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any property or asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected, including, without
limitation, any Contract (as defined in Section 3.21 below), except for such
conflicts, defaults and violations which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.    -12-     Section 3.07. SEC Reports and Financial

and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") all forms, reports, schedules,
registration statements, definitive proxy statements and other documents

they have been amended since the time of their filing and including any

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Since March

inclusion therein. The Proxy Statement and the Other Filings made by the
Company will, at the respective times filed with the SEC and mailed to the
shareholders, comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, if applicable, except
that no representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made
therein based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.    -14-     Section
3.10. Litigation. There is no legal action, suit, claim or
legal, administrative or other proceeding or, to the knowledge of the
Company, investigation that is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger,
nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction or order of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of the
Merger.   Section 3.11. Compliance with Applicable Laws. The Company and
its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, registrations, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities required in
connection with the ownership or occupancy of their respective properties and
assets and the operation of their respective businesses, including, without
limitation, all necessary permits for export transactions and registrations
with Governmental Entities as required under applicable export control laws,
except for such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and
approvals the failure of which to hold would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as referred to in the SEC
Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof, the Company
and its Subsidiaries are not in violation of any law, rule, regulation or
order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator applicable to the Company or
its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound or affected, including, without limitation, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "SARBANES-OXLEY ACT"), the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, all applicable United States export control laws and
regulations, and all applicable trade sanctions and embargoes (except that no
representation or warranty is made in this Section 3.11 with respect to
Environmental Laws or Taxes, which are exclusively the subject of Section
3.15 and Section 3.16, respectively, or the matters specifically covered by
Section 3.13), except for violations or possible violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12. Internal Controls.   (a) The Company has
established and maintains internal controls over financial reporting and
disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15
and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s
senior management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such internal controls over financial
reporting are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s authorization,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for assets and liabilities, (iii) access to assets or incurrence of liability
is permitted only in accordance with management\'s authorization and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets and liabilities is compared with the
existing assets and liabilities at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences.    -15-     (b) The
Company\'s management has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the board of
directors of the Company (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company\'s internal controls. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices.   (c) The chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any

with the IRS within the applicable remedial amendment period under Code

to any Plan required to be filed with, or furnished to, governmental
entities, Plan participants or Plan beneficiaries have been timely filed and

Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to
be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected in
the financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Reports to the
extent required under GAAP. There does not now exist nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, do any circumstances exist that would result in, any Controlled
Group Liability that would be a material liability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than routine claims for
benefits), following the Closing.   (e) As of the date hereof, (i) each
U.S. Plan that is subject to Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code
meets the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412
of the Code (without regard to any funding waiver); and (ii) neither the
Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is required to provide security to
such U.S. Plan pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA or Section 501(a)(29) of the
Code; and since its last valuation date, there have been no amendments to
such U.S. Plan that materially increase the present value of accrued
benefits.   (f) No U.S. Plan is a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. With respect to each U.S. Plan and, to the Company\'s
knowledge, each Foreign Plan, no claims are pending against any such Plan, or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such Plan, except in
respect of benefit payments in the normal course of business, and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, no employee, beneficiary, dependent, or governmental
agency has threatened any appeal or litigation regarding any matter with
respect to the Plans. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no U.S. Plan provides benefits, including without
limitation death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect

(other than (i) as required by Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, (ii) death
benefits or retirement benefits under any Qualified Plan or (iii) deferred
compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries).   (g) No prohibited transaction has occurred with
respect to any U.S. Plan that is not exempt under Section 4975 of the Code
and Section 406 of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in any transaction with respect to any U.S. Plan that could
subject it to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section
409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to Section
4975 or 4976 of the Code.   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(h) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no U.S. Plan has any interest in any annuity
contract or other investment or insurance contract issued by an insurance
company that is the subject of bankruptcy, conservatorship, rehabilitation or
similar proceeding.   (i) None of the persons performing services for the
Company or its Subsidiaries has been improperly classified as an independent
contractor or, in the case of employees, as being exempt from the payment of
wages for overtime, except for such improper classifications that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have created or
to create    -18-    after the date of this Agreement any liability of
the Company or any Subsidiary that exceeds or would exceed, together with any
liability referred to in the last sentence of Section 3.20, $5,000,000 in the
aggregate.   (j) With respect to each Foreign Plan: (i) if intended to be
funded or book-reserved, the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded
through insurance, or the reserve shown on the financial statements of the
Company for any unfunded Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the projected benefit
obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all current and former
participants in such plan based on reasonable, country-specific actuarial
assumptions and valuations, and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement
shall cause such assets or insurance obligations or book reserve to be less
than such projected benefit obligations; (ii) each Foreign Plan is in
material compliance with all registration requirements and has been
maintained in good standing with the appropriate regulatory authorities; and
(iii) each Foreign Plan intended to qualify for special tax treatment is in
material compliance with all requirements for such treatment. To the
knowledge of the Company, with respect to employees outside the
United States, none of the Company or any Subsidiary has made any ex-gratia
or voluntary payment to any such employee by way of superannuation,
pension allowance or otherwise.   (k) Each of the Company\'s "nonqualified
deferred compensation plans" within the meaning of Code Section 409A (and

compliance (as determined in accordance with applicable Treasury Department
guidance) with Code Section 409A   (l) Except as set forth in Section
3.13(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) there is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee, former employee,
independent contractor or former independent contractor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively could give rise to (or
already has resulted in) a payment by the Company (or the provision by the
Company of any other benefit such as accelerated vesting) that would not be
deductible by reason of Code Section 280G or subject to an excise tax under
Code Section 4999; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any indemnity obligation for any excise Taxes imposed under Code Section
4999; and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any
payments (or is required to make any payments pursuant to the terms of an
existing contract) that are not deductible under Code Section 162(m).

correct copy of such opinion to Parent solely for informational purposes

in any manner adverse to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.24. Brokers. Except for the engagement
of Goldman, Sachs and Co., whose fees will be paid by the Company, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers,

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Washington. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate    -27-    or lease its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
properties owned, operated or leased by it makes such qualification,
licensing or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so

the aggregate, prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Parent or
Merger Sub from satisfying their respective obligations under this
Agreement.   Section 4.02. Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, the Founder Voting Agreement and the
Founder Non-Competition Agreement (collectively, the "TRANSACTION

such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors\'
rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity and (iii) the remedies of
specific performance and injunctive relief and other forms of equitable
relief being subject to the discretion of the Governmental Entity before

Act and any applicable state  securities or "blue sky" laws are met and (iii)
the filing of the Articles  of Merger and other appropriate instruments, if
any, as required by the  WBCA is made, none of the execution and delivery of
the Transaction  Agreements by Parent or Merger Sub, the performance or
consummation by  Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
thereby or compliance  by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions
thereof will (x)  conflict with or violate the organizational documents of
Parent or Merger  Sub, (y) conflict with or violate any law, statute,
ordinance, rule,  regulation, order, judgment, decree, injunction or other
binding action or  requirement of any Governmental Entity applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub,  or any of their Subsidiaries, or by which any of them
or    -28-     any of their respective properties or assets may be

acceleration or  cancellation of, or result in any loss of any benefit under,
or the  creation of any Lien on any of the property or assets of Parent,
Merger  Sub, or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note,
bond,  mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise  or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub or
any of  their respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent, Merger
Sub, or  any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets or  properties may be bound or affected, except with respect to
clauses (y) and  (z), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent
or materially  impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions  contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or Parent or Merger
Sub from  satisfying their respective obligations under the Transaction
Agreements.   (b) None of the execution and delivery of the Transaction
Agreements  by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance or consummation by
Parent and  Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated thereby or compliance

materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the  other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Parent or Merger Sub  from
satisfying their respective obligations under this Agreement.   Section
4.04. Information. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by

whether or not in writing, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or

or Subsidiaries being an "acquiring person" under chapter 23B.19 of the
WBCA.   Section 4.07. Brokers. Except for the engagement of Rothschild Inc.
and Rothschild S.p.A., whose fees will be paid by Parent, none of Parent,

employees, has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for
any investment banking or brokerage fees, commissions or finder\'s fees in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for or with

prior to the Effective Time.   (c) No investigation by any of the parties or
their respective  Representatives shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or  agreements of the other parties set forth herein.
The Company makes no  representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information provided  pursuant to Section 5.02(a), and neither Merger Sub nor
Parent may rely on  the accuracy of any such information, in each case other
than as expressly  set forth in the Company\'s representations and warranties
contained in the  Transaction Agreements.   Section 5.03. Further
Assurances; Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided and to  applicable legal requirements, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub  shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use  its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action, and  to do, or cause to be done, in the case
of the Company, consistent with the  fiduciary duties of the Board with the
advice of the Company\'s outside  legal counsel, and    -35-     to
assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, as promptly  as
practicable, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable  laws
and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any material event or  circumstance relating to either the Company or
Parent or Merger Sub, or any  of their respective Subsidiaries, is discovered
by the Company or Parent,  as the case may be, and which should be set forth
in an amendment to the  Proxy Statement, the discovering party will promptly
inform the other party  of such event or circumstance. If at any time after
the Effective Time any  further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this  Agreement, including the execution of additional
instruments, the proper  officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall take all such  necessary or desirable action as is reasonable
under the circumstances.   (c) Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with
each other in taking,  or causing to take, at the direction of Parent, all
actions necessary to  delist the Shares from the NYSE and deregister the
shares under the  Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time.   Section 5.04. Filings; Consents.   (a) Upon the terms and
conditions hereof each of the parties hereto  shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts  to obtain as promptly as
practicable all material Consents of any  Governmental Entity or any other
person required in connection with, and  waivers of any material breaches or
material violations of any material  Contracts, permits, licenses or other
material agreements that may be  caused by, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, including, without limitation,
by (i) filing, or causing to be  filed, any Notification and Report Form and
related material required under  the HSR Act as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this  Agreement but, in any event, unless
specifically agreed otherwise by the  Company and Parent, no later than
thirty (30) calendar days after the date  of this Agreement, and by using its
reasonable best efforts to be able to  certify, and to certify, as soon as
reasonably practicable, its substantial  compliance with any such requests
for additional information or documentary  material that may be made under
the HSR Act, unless Parent and the Company  mutually determine that it is
reasonable under the circumstances not to  comply substantially with any
requests for additional information and  documentary material under the HSR
Act, (ii) promptly making all other  required filings or submissions to
Governmental Entities, (iii) cooperating  and consulting with one another in
(A) determining whether any other  filings are required, or are deemed
advisable, to be made with, or  Consents, permits, authorizations or
approvals are required, or are deemed  advisable, to be obtained from, any
third party, the United States  government or any other Governmental Entity
in connection with the  execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making
all such filings and  timely seeking all such Consents, permits,
authorizations, approvals or  waivers and (iv) generally, taking, or causing
to be taken, all other  actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any  antitrust, competition or trade regulation law
that may be asserted by any  Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger
so as to enable the Closing  to occur as    -36-     soon as
reasonably possible, and in any event no later than the Extended  Termination
Date (as defined in Section 7.01(b)) or, if applicable, the  Final
Termination Date (as defined in Section 7.01(b)), provided that the  Company
shall not be required to obtain any Consent from any person other  than
Governmental Entities unless Parent reimburses the Company for all 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such Consent; 
provided, however, that the Company shall not pay or agree to pay any fee  or
other similar charge to any such person in order to obtain its Consent 
without the prior written approval of Parent not to be unreasonably 
withheld.   In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause
its  Subsidiaries to, take all such actions, including, without limitation,
(x)  proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree,  hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of  such assets or businesses of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, after  the Effective Time, of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries and (y)  otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
limit or would limit  Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' (including, after the
Effective Time, the  Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' as Subsidiaries of
Parent) freedom of  action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or
more of their  respective businesses, product lines or assets, in each case
as may be  required in order to avoid the entry of any order, judgment,
decree,  injunction, temporary restraining order, or ruling of a court of
competent  jurisdiction or any Governmental Entity in any suit or proceeding,
which  would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying
the  Closing; provided further, however, that Parent shall not be required
to  take any such action, and the failure to do so shall not be deemed to be
a  failure to exercise its reasonable best efforts as required by this
Section  5.04(a), if such actions, individually or in the aggregate, would
require  the sale, divestiture, licensing or other disposition in any form 
(collectively, a "DIVESTITURE") of any one or more businesses or assets, 
including without limitation, product lines, brands, or other particular 
types or groups of assets (collectively, the "SPECIFIED ASSETS") and: (A)  in
the case of one or more required Divestitures of Specified Assets of  Parent
or one or more of its Subsidiaries, and/or the Company and or one or  more of
its Subsidiaries, that are sold at wholesale, such Specified Assets 
accounted for more than $85 million in the worldwide consolidated net sales 
of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to all customers, including 
the amount of the intercompany sales of such Specified Assets by each party 
to its own retail division or retail segment, as the case may be; or (B) 
without limiting the applicability of clause (A) above, in the case of one 
or more required Divestitures of Specified Assets of Parent or one or more 
of its Subsidiaries, and/or the Company and one or more of its  Subsidiaries,
that are not sold at wholesale, including, without  limitation, Specified
Assets consisting of retail assets, such Specified  Assets accounted for more
than $100 million in the worldwide consolidated  net sales of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be; with, in each such  case, consolidated net sales
to be determined for the four most recently  completed consecutive fiscal
quarters of Parent and/or the Company, as the  case may be. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall propose,  negotiate, or commit to
any such sale, divestiture or disposition of any of  its assets, businesses
or product lines without Parent\'s prior written  consent.    -37-    
(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, without limitation: (i)  promptly
notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with  copies of
(or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other of) any 
communications from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) permit the other to  review
and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the  other in
connection with, any proposed written or any oral communication  with any
such Governmental Entity; (iii) not participate in any meeting or  have any
communication with any such Governmental Entity unless it has  given the
other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the  extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party the  opportunity
to attend and participate therein; and (iv) furnish the other  party with
copies of all filings and communications between it (or its  advisors) and
any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding  the foregoing,
the rights of the Company and Parent under this Section  5.04(b) may be
exercised on their behalf by their respective outside  counsel.   Section
5.05. Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing the terms of
this Agreement shall be a joint press release. Thereafter, other than in
connection with reasonable responses to questions in quarterly
earnings conference calls, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agree to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, agree to provide to the other party for review a copy of any such
press release or public statement, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and review,
unless required by applicable law or any listing agreement with a securities
exchange.   Section 5.06. Indemnification; Employees and Employee
Benefits.   (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and
advancement  of expenses now existing in favor of any individual who at or
prior to the  Effective Time was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries or who, at the request of the Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member, trustee
or fiduciary  of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other  employee benefit plan or enterprise (together with such
individual\'s heirs,  executors or administrators, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
as provided by  applicable law and/or in the articles of incorporation and
by-laws of the  Company and its Subsidiaries existing and in effect on the
date hereof  and/or indemnification agreements existing and in effect on the
date  hereof, shall survive the Merger, and shall continue in full force
and  effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time
(or,  with respect to any indemnification agreement, the term of such 
indemnification agreement, if such term is less than six years) unless 
otherwise required by applicable law, and the indemnification and 
advancement of expenses provisions of the articles of incorporation and  by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the Company  and
such indemnification agreements, indemnification and advancement of  expenses
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified,  provided
that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within  such six-
year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement of  expenses in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final  disposition
of any and all such claims. From and after the Effective Time,  Parent shall
cause the Sole Shareholder to assume, be jointly and severally  liable for,
and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the  Surviving
Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms,  each of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.06.    -38-     (b) Parent agrees
that, from and after the Effective Time, the  Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained in effect for not less  than six years (except as
provided in the last proviso of this Section  5.06(b)) from the Effective
Time the current policies of directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company; provided, however,  that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least  the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are not materially  less advantageous to the
beneficiaries of the current policies and with  carriers having an A.M. Best
"key rating" of AX or better, provided that  such substitution shall not
result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with  respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, and provided  further, that the Surviving
Corporation shall first use its reasonable best  efforts to obtain from such
carriers a so-called "tail" policy providing  such coverage and being
effective for the full six year period referred to  above, and shall be
entitled to obtain such coverage in annual policies  from such carriers only
if it is unable, after exerting such efforts for a  reasonable period of
time, to obtain such a "tail" policy; and provided  further, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an  annual premium in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the  Company prior to the
date hereof as set forth in Section 5.06(b) of the  Company Disclosure
Schedule (or, in the case of a "tail" policy obtained  pursuant to the
preceding proviso, shall not be required to pay an  aggregate premium
therefor in excess of an amount equal to six times 250%  of such last annual
premium) and, if the Surviving Corporation is unable to  obtain the insurance
required by this Section 5.06(b), it shall obtain as  much comparable
insurance as possible for an annual premium (or an  aggregate premium, as the
case may be) equal to such maximum amount.   (c) In the event that Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of  their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into  any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation  or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or  substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then and in  either such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and  assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall  assume the obligations set forth in
this Section. It is expressly agreed  that the Indemnified Parties shall be
third party beneficiaries of Section  5.06(a) and Section 5.06(b) above, and
of this Section 5.06(c).   (d) For the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on  December 31, 2008 (the "CONTINUATION PERIOD"), Parent shall
cause the  Surviving Corporation to provide U.S. Employees with compensation
and  benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate, determined on an 
individual basis, than those provided to such individual under the 
Company\'s Employee Benefit Arrangements applicable to U.S. Employees in 
effect at the Effective Time or otherwise (exclusive of benefits related to 
the equity securities of the Company); provided, however, that nothing 
herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating 
any specific plan, program, policy, practice or arrangement, or require  that
the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the  securities of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or interfere with the  Surviving
Corporation\'s obligation to make such changes as are necessary to  comply
with applicable law, or preclude the Surviving    -39-     Corporation
from terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason  for which the
Company could have terminated the employment of such person  or that was not
prohibited prior to the Effective Time. During the  Continuation Period,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to  provide Non-U.S. Employees
with compensation and benefits that are no less  favorable in the aggregate,
determined, with respect to each separate  country in which such Non-U.S.
Employees work, on a group basis rather than  on an individual basis for such
country, than the less favorable of: (i)  those provided under the Company\'s
Employee Benefit Arrangements for the  Non-U.S. Employees in such country; or
(ii) those provided by the Company\'s  Employee Benefit Arrangements for its
U.S. Employees, in each case, as in  effect as of the Effective Time, but
exclusive of benefits related to the  equity securities of the Company;
provided that, in any event, benefits  provided to the Non-U.S. Employees
that are immaterial, but customary and  reasonable in the local jurisdiction,
shall be continued during the  Continuation Period. "U.S. EMPLOYEES" means
employees and former employees  of the Company and its Subsidiaries who work
or worked in the United  States. "NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES" means employees and
former employees of the  Company and its Subsidiaries who work or worked
outside the United States.   (e) Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation)  shall honor all Employee Benefit Arrangements
(including, without  limitation, any severance, change of control and similar
plans and  agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior  to the Effective Time (except for such changes made to any
Employee Benefit  Arrangement between the date hereof and the Effective Time
that are not  made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement), subject
to any  amendment or termination thereof after the Effective Time that may
be  permitted by the terms thereof, and except that Parent and its
affiliates  shall be permitted to amend or terminate any plan, program,
policy,  practice or arrangement as permitted pursuant to the proviso in the
first  sentence in Section 5.06(d) above.   (f) For all purposes under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and  its affiliates providing benefits to
any Employees after the Effective Time  (the "NEW PLANS"), each Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of  service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time  (including predecessor or acquired
entities or any other entities for which  the Company and its Subsidiaries
have given credit for prior service), to  the same extent as such Employee
was entitled, as at the Effective Time, to  credit for such service under any
similar or comparable plans (except to  the extent such credit would result
in a duplication of accrual of benefits  in whole or in part). In addition,
and without limiting the generality of  the foregoing: (i) each Employee
immediately shall be eligible to  participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all New Plans to the  extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a similar or  comparable plan in which such Employee
participated immediately before the  Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the "OLD PLANS"); and (ii) for  purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or  vision benefits to any
Employee, Parent shall with respect to fully insured  programs use its best
efforts to, and with respect to self-insured programs  shall, cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work  requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Employee and his or her  covered dependents, and
Parent shall cause any eligible    -40-     expenses incurred by such
Employee and his or her covered dependents during  the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such  Employee\'s participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken  into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,  coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements, as well as all maximums  or caps with respect to
number of visits or annual or lifetime dollar  limitations, applicable to
such Employee and his or her covered dependents  for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid or such  visits occurred in accordance with
such New Plan. Notwithstanding the  foregoing provisions of this Section
5.01(f) or any other term or provision  of this Agreement to the contrary,
subject to the requirements, if any, of  applicable law, in no event shall
any Employee be credited with such years  of service in connection with
vesting rights under, or be entitled to be a  beneficiary under, any pension
plan now or hereafter established by Parent  or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(g) Section 5.06(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a 
description of the Company\'s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") as in 
effect as of the date of this Agreement and includes a list of the  Employees
of the Company who are, as of the date of this Agreement,  grantees of any
benefit under the LTIP, specifying for each the particular  target benefit
held by such person. Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the
contrary, the LTIP shall be modified by the Company prior  to, but effective
as of, the Effective Time, in all material respects, in  accordance with the
terms of such modification set forth in Section 5.06(g)  of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and pursuant to such instruments,  documents and
resolutions of the Board (or a committee thereof) as shall be  reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Parent.   (h) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to continue  arrangements with a service provider to
the Company on the terms set forth  in Section 5.06(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.   Section 5.07. No Solicitation.   (a) The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, the Company  Representatives and its
directors to, immediately cease and cause to be  terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any  parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The  Company also will
promptly request each person that has heretofore executed  a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of an  Acquisition Proposal
and in connection with which discussions are taking  place, or have taken
place during the twelve (12) month period preceding  the date of this
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, to  return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such  person by the Company
or on the Company\'s behalf.   (b) The Company agrees that, prior to the
Effective Time, it shall  not, directly or indirectly, and shall not permit
or cause any of its  Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any
Company  Representatives or any of its directors to, directly or indirectly,
(i)  initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing  non-public information) the making of any proposal or offer
concerning an  Acquisition Proposal or (ii)    -41-     engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any  non-public
information or data to any person relating to, an Acquisition  Proposal,
whether made before or after the date of this Agreement unless,  after the
date hereof, (A) the Company receives a bona fide written  proposal not
initiated, solicited or knowingly encouraged in violation of  this Agreement
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (B) the Board in  good faith
determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel  and
independent financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal may 
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Acquisition Proposal, (C)  the
Company (x) shall have provided at least 48 hours advance written  notice to
Parent that it intends to take such action, which shall also set  forth the
identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, all of  the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and delivery of  complete copies of
all documents reflecting or related to the Acquisition  Proposal, and (y)
shall have received from such person an executed  customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less stringent in  all material respects, than
those terms contained in the Confidentiality  Agreements, including, in any
event, a prohibition on such person from  purchasing or otherwise acquiring
any capital stock of the Company while  such person is engaged in
negotiations with the Company, provided that the  Company shall promptly
notify Parent if and when such prohibition is no  longer in effect; provided
that such confidentiality agreement shall not  contain any exclusivity
provision or other term that would prevent the  Company from consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  and (D) the Company shall have
made available to Parent (or Parent\'s  counsel pursuant to a joint defense
agreement) the same nonpublic  information being furnished to such person.
The Company shall promptly  notify Parent of any material amendments or
revisions to any such  Acquisition Proposal.   (c) The Board (or any
committee thereof) shall not (i) except as  permitted by this Section 5.07,
withdraw, modify or change, or propose  publicly to withdraw, modify or
change, in a manner adverse to Parent, the  Company Board Recommendation (as
defined in Section 5.08) (a "CHANGE OF  BOARD RECOMMENDATION"), (ii) except
as permitted by this Section 5.07,  approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any  Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  to enter into or approve any letter of
intent, agreement in principle,  acquisition agreement or similar agreement
relating to any Acquisition  Proposal (an "ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"), unless
(with respect to taking any  action described in (i), (ii) or (iii)), prior
to the date on which the  Required Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
(A) subject to clause (B)  below, the Board has received an Acquisition
Proposal theretofore described  to Parent as required by Section 5.07(b)
which it has determined in good  faith (after having consulted with outside
legal counsel and its  independent financial advisors) is a Superior
Acquisition Proposal and has  determined that the failure of the Board to
terminate this Agreement or  withdraw, modify or change the Company Board
Recommendation would be  inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
directors and (B) the Company  has notified Parent in writing of all of the
terms and conditions of the  Superior Acquisition Proposal together with
delivery to Parent of complete  copies of all documents reflecting or related
to such Superior Acquisition  Proposal and of the determinations described in
clause (A) above and of its  intent to take such action, and has taken into
account any revised proposal  made by Parent to the Company (a "REVISED
PARENT PROPOSAL") within five (5)  business days after Parent\'s receipt of
such notice and again has    -42-     determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel  and independent financial
advisors that such Acquisition Proposal (as the  same may have been modified
or amended) remains a Superior Acquisition  Proposal; provided, however, that
if a Revised Parent Proposal has been  made, and the Acquisition Proposal has
been modified or amended after the  Revised Parent Proposal was made, then
the Company shall promptly notify  Parent in writing of all of the terms and
conditions of such modification  or amendment together with delivery of
complete copies of all documents  reflecting or related to such modification
or amendment, and any such  modification or amendment to such Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to  be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of
re-starting, as of the date  of Parent\'s receipt of such notice, the five
(5) business day period  described above in this clause (B). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the  Board (or any committee thereof) makes a Change of
Board Recommendation  that is either (a) made in connection with a Superior
Acquisition Proposal  that is an Acquisition Proposal described in clause
(ii) of the definition  of Acquisition Proposal or (b) made pursuant to
Section 5.07(e) (either  such Change of Board Recommendation described in
clauses (a) or (b), a  "SPECIFIED CHANGE OF BOARD RECOMMENDATION"), then, to
the extent permitted  under the WBCA (including pursuant to subsection (2)(a)
of Section  23B.11.030 of the WBCA), the Company shall take all actions as
necessary to  call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting so
as to permit  the Special Meeting to be held in compliance with Section 5.09
without a  recommendation of the Board.   (d) The term "ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL" shall mean any offer or proposal  (whether or not in writing and
whether or not delivered to the Company\'s  shareholders generally), from any
person to acquire, in a single  transaction or series of transactions, by
merger, tender offer, stock  acquisition, asset acquisition, consolidation,
liquidation, business  combination or otherwise (i) at least 50% of any class
of equity securities  of the Company, or (ii) assets of the Company and/or
one or more of its  Subsidiaries which in the aggregate constitutes 35% or
more of the net  revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken  as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The  term "SUPERIOR ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall mean any bona
fide unsolicited  written Acquisition Proposal on terms more favorable to the
holders of  Shares than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into  account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement  (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement), as well as the anticipated
timing,  conditions and prospects for completion of such Acquisition
Proposal;  provided further, that if any negotiations with a third party
related to an  Acquisition Proposal that are not initiated, solicited or
knowingly  encouraged in violation of this Section 5.07 in compliance with
subsection  (b) above result in a revised bona fide Acquisition Proposal from
such  third party being made to the Company, then such revised Acquisition 
Proposal shall also be considered a bona fide Acquisition Proposal not 
initiated, solicited or knowingly encouraged in violation of this Section 
5.07.   (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board,
in  circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, from effecting a 
Change of Board Recommendation to the extent that the Board determines in 
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action 
is necessary under applicable law in order for the directors to comply   
-43-   with their fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders. The
Company  shall give Parent and Merger Sub written notice of any such action
taken by  the Board not later than the business day next succeeding the day
on which  such action is taken, setting forth in reasonable detail the action
taken  and the basis therefore.   (f) Nothing contained in this Section
5.07 or elsewhere in this  Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its  shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated  under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company\'s  shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Board, after  consultation with its outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law or such  disclosure would be necessary to comply with the Company\'s
obligations  under federal securities laws or the rules of the NYSE; provided
that any  such disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) (other than a
"stop,  look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type
contemplated  by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
a Change of  Board Recommendation unless the Board expressly reaffirms to the
Company\'s  shareholders in such disclosure the Company Board
Recommendation.   Section 5.08. Preparation of the Proxy Statement.   (a)
As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this  Agreement, the
Company shall prepare a preliminary proxy statement relating  to the meeting
of the Company\'s shareholders to be held in connection with  the Merger
(together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, in  each case
in the form or forms mailed to the Company\'s shareholders, the  "PROXY
STATEMENT") and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent and  Merger Sub
shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation and filing  of the Proxy
Statement. The Proxy Statement shall include a recommendation  of the Board
(the "COMPANY BOARD RECOMMENDATION") that its shareholders  vote in favor of
the Merger and this Agreement (subject to Section 5.07  hereof). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the  Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC as promptly as practicable after such  filing. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the  Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company\'s shareholders as promptly as  practicable and, in any event, within
five (5) business days after the  Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.  
(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event shall occur  that
should be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the Proxy 
Statement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendment  or
supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. Parent,  Merger

officers or shareholders, affiliates or agents, other than pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 7.02, Section 7.03, Article VIII (excluding
Section 8.01 and Section 8.11) and the confidentiality obligations set forth

Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise  provided

Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses.   (b) In the event that (x) the
Company shall have terminated this  Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii), (y) Parent shall have terminated  this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(g) or (z) Parent shall have  terminated this Agreement pursuant

date of the Special Meeting, any person  (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective affiliates) has made to  the Company an Acquisition Proposal
or shall have publicly announced an  intention (whether or not conditional)
to make a proposal or offer relating  to an Acquisition Proposal and, within
twelve (12) months following such  termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or  indirectly, (i) enters into a definitive agreement
for an Acquisition  Proposal with any person who has made an Acquisition
Proposal or any  affiliate of such person between the date of this Agreement
and the date of  such termination or (ii) consummates a transaction with
respect to an  Acquisition Proposal with any person, then the Company shall
promptly (and,  in any event, within three business days after the later of
such  termination by Parent, the execution of a definitive agreement for an 
Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, as 
applicable, or in the case of such termination by the Company, immediately 
upon such termination) pay to Parent a termination fee of $69 million (the 
"PARENT TERMINATION FEE"). The Company shall not withhold any amount from 
the Parent Termination Fee so long as Parent shall have delivered to the 
Company a duly signed and completed IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form 
thereto) claiming its entitlement as a resident of Italy to an exemption 
from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to the Parent Termination  Fee
pursuant to the income tax treaty between Italy and the United States.  The
Parent Termination Fee shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately 
available funds.   (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section  7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) as a result of the failure to
satisfy the  Antitrust Regulatory Conditions and provided that the condition
set forth  in Section 6.01(a) and all conditions to the obligations of Parent
and  Merger Sub set forth in Section 6.02 have been satisfied on the date
this  Agreement is terminated (other than the conditions set forth in the
last  sentence of Section 6.02(b)), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause  Merger Sub to, promptly (and, in any event, within three business
days  after such termination) pay to the Company $80 million (the
"TERMINATION  AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT FEE") as promptly as practicable
following such  termination of this Agreement. The Termination and Expense
Reimbursement  Fee shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The  Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee shall be
unconditionally  guaranteed by Parent pursuant to that certain Guarantee, in
the form  attached hereto as Exhibit D, executed and delivered by it
concurrently  herewith.   (d) The parties hereto agree that the provisions
contained in this  Section 7.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, that the damages resulting from the
termination of this  Agreement as set forth in Sections 7.03(b) and (c) of
this    -51-    Agreement are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and that the  amounts payable pursuant to Sections 7.03(b) and
(c) hereof are reasonable  forecasts of the actual damages which may be
incurred by the parties under  such circumstances. The amounts payable
pursuant to Sections 7.03(b) and  (c) hereof constitute liquidated damages
and not a penalty and shall be the  sole monetary remedy in the event of
termination of this Agreement on the  bases specified in such Sections. If
either party fails to pay to the other  party any amounts due under Sections
7.03(b) and (c) in accordance with the  terms hereof, the breaching party
shall pay the costs and expenses  (including legal fees and expenses) of the
other party in connection with  any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action,  taken to collect payment.   (e) Any amounts
not paid when due pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall  bear interest from the
date such payment is due until the date paid at a  rate equal to the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such  payment was required to be
made.   Section 7.04. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after any approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which
decreases the Merger Price or which adversely affects the rights of the
Company\'s shareholders hereunder without the approval of such shareholders.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of all the parties.   Section 7.05. Extension; Waiver. Subject to
the express limitations herein, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any
other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein by any other party or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other party or (iii)
unless prohibited by applicable laws, waive compliance with any of the
covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
will not constitute a waiver of such rights.   ARTICLE VIII  
MISCELLANEOUS   Section 8.01. Non-Survival of Representations and
Warranties. The representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall
not survive beyond the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
agreements set forth in Section 1.09, Section 1.10, Section 2.01, Section
5.03(c), Section 5.06 and this Article VIII shall survive the Effective Time
for the applicable statute of limitations (except to the extent a shorter

8.02. Entire Agreement; Assignment.   (a) This Agreement (including the
documents and the instruments  referred to herein) together with the
Confidentiality Agreements  constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements,  understandings, representations and warranties, both
written and oral,  among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the
subject matter  hereof and thereof. No representation, warranty, inducement,
promise,  understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been
made or  relied upon by any of the parties.   (b) Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or  obligations hereunder will be assigned
by any of the parties hereto  (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written  consent of the other party. Any purported
assignment not permitted under  this Section 8.02(b) will be null and void ab
initio. Subject to the  preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the  benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective  successors and assigns.   Section 8.03. Validity. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not

vote on the action were present and voted.   2. To the extent that the Act
requires prior notice of any such action to be given to nonconsenting or

to the date on which the action becomes effective (or such longer period as
required by law, in the case of a significant business transaction under RCW
23B.19.020(15)). The form of notice shall be sufficient to apprise the
nonconsenting or nonvoting shareholder of the nature of the action to be
effected in a manner approved by the Board of Directors or by the committee
or officers to whom the Board of Directors has delegated
that responsibility.   3. Unless these Articles of Incorporation provide
for a greater voting requirement for any voting group of shareholders, the
affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of all of the votes

Section 1. Annual Meeting. An annual meeting of the shareholders for the
election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as
may properly come before the meeting shall be held each year on the date and
at the time determined by the Board of Directors. The failure to hold an
annual meeting at the time stated in these Bylaws does not affect the
validity of any corporate action.   Section 2. Special Meetings. Except as
otherwise provided by law, special meetings of shareholders of this
Corporation shall be held whenever called by the Board of Directors or an
authorized committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with the
provisions of these Bylaws.   Section 3. Place of Meetings. Meeting of
shareholders shall be held at such place within or without the State of
Washington as determined by the Board of Directors, pursuant to proper
notice.   Section 4. Notice. Written notice of each shareholders\'
meeting stating the date, time, and place and, in case of a special meeting,
the purpose(s) for which such meeting is called, shall be given by the
Corporation not less than ten (10) (unless a greater period of notice is
required by law in a particular case) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to
the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting unless required by law to send notice to all shareholders
regardless of whether or not such shareholders are entitled to vote, to the
shareholder\'s address as it appears on the current record of shareholders of
this Corporation.   Section 5. Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive any
notice required to be given by these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation of
this Corporation, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Articles
of Incorporation"), or the Washington Business Corporation Act, as amended
from time to time (the "Act"), before or after the meeting that is the
subject of such notice. A valid waiver is created by any of the following
three methods: (a) in writing, signed by the shareholder entitled to the
notice and delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in its corporate
records; (b) attendance at the meeting, unless the shareholder at the
beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting
business at the meeting; or (c) as to the consideration of a particular
matter that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting
notice, the shareholders\' failure to object at the time of presentation of
such matter for consideration.     Section 6. Quorum of Shareholders. At
any meeting of the shareholders, holders of a majority of the votes of all
the shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented by shareholders of
record in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum.   Once a share is
represented at a meeting, other than to object to holding the meeting or
transacting business, it is deemed to be present for quorum purposes for the
remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new
record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. At such reconvened
meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at
the meeting as originally noticed.   Section 7. Proxies. Shareholders of
record may vote at any meeting either in person or by proxy executed in
writing. A proxy is effective when received by the Secretary of the
Corporation or another officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to
tabulate votes for the Corporation. A proxy is valid for eleven (11) months
unless a longer period is expressly provided in the proxy.   Section 8.
Voting. Subject to the provisions of the laws of the State of Washington, and
unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, each outstanding
share is entitled to one (1) vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders\'
meeting, with all shares voting together as a single class.   Section 9.
Action by shareholders. Except as otherwise provided for in the Articles of
Incorporation of the Corporation and if a quorum exists, the affirmative vote
of a majority of all of the votes cast by a voting group shall be sufficient,
valid and effective to approve and authorize any acts of the Corporation
that, under the Act, would otherwise require the approval of two-thirds (2/3)
of all of the votes entitled to be cast, including, without limitation: (i)
an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation; (ii) the merger of the
Corporation into another corporation or the merger of one or more
other corporations into the Corporation; (iii) the acquisition by another
corporation of all of the outstanding shares of one or more classes or series
of capital stock of the Corporation; (iv) the sale, lease, exchange or other
disposition by the Corporation of all or substantially all of its property
otherwise than in the usual and regular course of business; or (v) the
dissolution of the Corporation.   Section 10. Adjournment. A majority of
the shares represented at the meeting, even if less than a quorum, may
adjourn any meeting of the shareholders from time to time. At a reconvened
meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted at the
meeting as originally noticed. If a meeting is adjourned to a different date,
time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if a
new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment;
however, if a new record date of the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed in
accordance with the corporate laws of the State of Washington, notice of the
adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new
record date.   Section 11. Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder
Proposals and Director Nominations. Any shareholder seeking to bring business
before or to nominate a    2    director or directors at any meeting
of shareholders, must provide written notice thereof in accordance with this
Section 11 The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than (i) with respect
to an annual meeting of shareholders, one hundred twenty (120) calendar days
in advance of the date that the Corporation\'s proxy statement was released
to shareholders in connection with the previous year\'s annual meeting,
except that if no annual meeting of shareholders was held in the previous
year or if the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than
thirty (30) calendar days from the date contemplated at the time of the
previous year\'s proxy statement, such notice must be received by the
Corporation a reasonable time before the Corporation\'s proxy statement is to
be released, and (ii) with respect to a special meeting of shareholders, a
reasonable time before the Corporation\'s proxy statement is to be released.
The Board of Directors may waive this advance notice requirement at its
discretion, and shall be deemed to have so waived such notice requirement
if it does not object to a shareholder proposal or director nomination
presented without adequate notice at the time it is made.   ARTICLE II

shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs

notice of that meeting unless said director, at the beginning of the meeting,
or promptly upon such director\'s arrival, objects to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or

time by giving written notice to the Board of Directors, its Chairman, or the
President or Secretary of this Corporation. Any such resignation is effective

committees thereof), and may be paid a stated salary as director, or a fixed
sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors (and each
meeting of any committee thereof), or both. No such payment shall preclude
any director from serving this Corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor.   Section 13. Presumption of Assent. A
director of this Corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board of

to be issued and the consideration to be received. A good faith determination
by the Board that the consideration received or to be received for the shares
to be issued is adequate is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of
consideration relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.   Section 2. Issuance of Certificated Shares. Unless the

uncertificated, certificates for shares of the Corporation shall be in such
form as is consistent with the provisions of the Act. The certificate shall

on the books of this Corporation, upon surrender thereof so assigned or
endorsed.   Section 4. Loss or Destruction of Certificates. In case of the
loss, mutilation or destruction of a certificate of stock, a duplicate
certificate may be issued upon such terms as the Board of Directors shall
prescribe.    10     Section 5. Issuance of Uncertificated Shares. The
Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of
any or all of the Corporation\'s classes or series of stock without
certificates; provided, however, that such authorization shall not affect
shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the
Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares
without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholders, a written
statement of the information required on certificates by the Act. Said
statement shall be informational to the shareholder and not incontrovertible
evidence of stock ownership.   The statement shall be signed by original or
facsimile signature of two officers of the Corporation, and the seal of the
Corporation may be affixed thereto.   Section 6. Transfer of Uncertificated
Stock. Transfer of uncertificated shares of stock may be accomplished by
delivery of an assignment in writing or by a written power of attorney to
assign and transfer the same on the books of the Corporation, signed by the
record holder of the shares. Surrender of the written statement shall not be
a requirement for transfer of the shares so represented.   Section 7.
Record Date and Transfer Books. For the purpose of determining shareholders
who are entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or
any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or
in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper
purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for any such
determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more
than seventy (70) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less
than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action,
requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken.   If no
record date is fixed for such purposes, the date on which notice of the
meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board
of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be
the record date for such determination of shareholders.   When a
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to
any adjournment thereof, unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record
date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting.   Section
8. Voting Record. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer
books for shares of this Corporation shall make at least ten (10) days before
each meeting of shareholders a complete record of the shareholders entitled
to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical
order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. Such record
shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and
shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole
time of the meeting for the purposes thereof.    11     ARTICLE VI  
BOOKS AND RECORDS   Section 1. Books of Accounts, Minutes and Share
Register. The Corporation:   a. Shall keep as permanent records minutes of
all meetings of its  shareholders and Board of Directors, a record of all
actions taken by the  shareholders or Board of Directors without a meeting,
and a record of all  actions taken by a committee of the Board of Directors
exercising the  authority of the Board of Directors on behalf of the
Corporation;   b. Shall maintain appropriate accounting records;   c. Or
its agent shall maintain a record of its shareholders, in a  format that
permits preparation of a list of the names and addresses of all 
shareholders, in alphabetical order by class of shares showing the number 
and class of shares held by each; and   d. Shall keep a copy of the
following records at its principal  office:   (1) The Articles of
Incorporation;   (2) The Bylaws or Restated Bylaws and all amendments to
them  currently in effect;   (3) The minutes of all shareholders\'
meetings, and records  of all actions taken by shareholders without a

generally  within the past three (3) years;   (6) A list of the names and
business addresses of its  current directors and officers; and   (7) Its
most recent annual report delivered to the Secretary  of Sate of
Washington.    12     Section 2. Copies of Resolutions. Any person
dealing with the Corporation may rely upon a copy of any of the records of
the proceedings, resolutions or votes of the Board of Directors or
shareholders, when certified by the President or Secretary.   ARTICLE
VII   INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS  
Section 1. Indemnification Rights of Directors, Officers, Employees and
Agents. The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers and
may indemnify its employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") to the
full extent permitted by the Act or other applicable law, as then in effect,
and the Articles of Incorporation, against liability arising out of a
proceeding to which each such Indemnified Party was made a party because the
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall advance expenses incurred by each such
Indemnified Party who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final
disposition of the proceeding, as provided by applicable law, the Articles of
Incorporation or by written agreement, which written agreement may allow any
required determinations to be made by any appropriate person or body
consisting of a member or members of the Board of Directors, or any other
person or body appointed by the Board of Directors, who is not a party to the
particular claim for which an Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification,
or independent legal counsel.   The Corporation is not obligated to
indemnify an Indemnified Party for any amounts paid in settlement of any
proceeding without the Corporation\'s prior written consent to such
settlement and payment. The Corporation shall not settle any proceeding in
any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on an Indemnified
Party without such Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent. Neither the
Corporation nor an Indemnified Party may unreasonably withhold its consent to
a proposed settlement.   Section 2. Contract and Related Rights.   a.
Contract Rights. The right of an Indemnified Party to indemnification and
advancement of expenses is a contract right upon which the Indemnified Party
shall be presumed to have relied in determining to serve or to continue to
serve in his or her capacity with the Corporation. Such right shall continue
as long as the Indemnified Party shall be subject to any possible proceeding.
Any amendment to or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any
right or protection of an Indemnified Party with respect to any acts or
omissions of such Indemnified Party occurring prior to such amendment
or repeal.   b. Optional Insurance, Contracts and Funding. The
Corporation may:   (1) Maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself  and any Indemnified Party against any liability, whether or not the 
Corporation would have power to indemnify the Indemnified Party against the 
same liability under Sections 23B.08.510 or .520 of the Act, or a   
13     successor section or statute;   (2) Enter into contracts with any
Indemnified Party in  furtherance of this Article and consistent with the
Act; and   (3) Create a trust fund, grant a security interest, or use 
other means (including without limitation a letter of credit) to ensure the 
payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification 
provided in this Article.   Section 3. Exceptions. Any other provision
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation shall not be
obligated pursuant to the terms of these Bylaws to indemnify or advance
expenses to an Indemnified Party with respect to any proceeding:   a.
initiated or brought voluntarily by an Indemnified Party and  not by way of
defense, except with respect to proceedings brought to  establish or enforce
a right to indemnification under these Bylaws, the  Articles of Incorporation
or any statute or law; but such indemnification  or advancement of expenses
may be provided by the Corporation in specific  cases if the Board of
Directors finds it to be appropriate;   b. instituted by an Indemnified
Party to enforce or interpret the  provisions hereof or the Articles of
Incorporation, if a court of competent  jurisdiction determines that each of
the material assertions made by such  Indemnified Party in such proceeding
was not made in good faith or was  frivolous;   c. to the extent such
Indemnified Party has otherwise actually  received payment (under any
insurance policy or otherwise) of the amounts  otherwise indemnifiable
hereunder; or   d. if the Corporation is prohibited by the Articles of 
Incorporation, the Act or other applicable law as then in effect from  paying
such indemnification and/or advancement of expenses.   ARTICLE VIII  
AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS   Section 1. By the Shareholders. These Bylaws may be
amended or repealed by a resolution duly adopted by not less than a majority
of the shares entitled to vote thereon.   Section 2. By the Board of
Directors. These Bylaws may be amended or repealed, or new Bylaws may be
adopted, by a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the whole Board of
Directors.    14    EXHIBIT C   CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS -
ENTITY   Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must

(including Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal

transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the

TRANSFEROR] is not a foreign corporation, foreign  partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are  defined in the Internal Revenue

disregarded entity as defined in  Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);   3. [NAME OF TRANSFEROR]\'s U.S. employer

TRANSFEROR]\'s office address is:   [ADDRESS]   [NAME OF TRANSFEROR]

Service by the transferee and that any false statement contained herein could
be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.   Under penalties of perjury I
declare that I have examined this certification and to the best of my

as of the 20th day of June, 2007 by LUXOTTICA GROUP S.P.A., an Italian
corporation (the "GUARANTOR"), in favor and for the benefit of OAKLEY, INC.,
a Washington corporation ("OAKLEY").   WITNESSETH   WHEREAS, the Guarantor
beneficially indirectly owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of Norma
Acquisition Corp., a Washington corporation (the "PAYOR"); and   WHEREAS,
the Payor has entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), with Oakley and the
Guarantor, pursuant to which the Guarantor has agreed to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Oakley through the merger (the
"MERGER") of the Payor with and into Oakley; and   WHEREAS, pursuant to
Section 7.03(c) of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, Payor has agreed to pay to Oakley the
Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee; and   WHEREAS, as an inducement
to Oakley to enter into the Merger Agreement, Guarantor has agreed to
guarantee Payor\'s obligation to pay the Termination and Expense
Reimbursement Fee;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees as
follows:  1. DEFINED TERMS.   (a) Unless otherwise defined herein, terms
defined in the Merger Agreement  and used herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the Merger  Agreement.   (b) The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar  import when used in this Guarantee
shall refer to this Guarantee as a  whole and not to any particular provision
of this Guarantee, and  Section and paragraph references are to this
Guarantee unless  otherwise specified.   (c) The meanings given to terms
defined herein shall be equally applicable  to both the singular and plural
forms of such terms.  2. GUARANTEE. Subject to the provisions hereof, the
Guarantor hereby  unconditionally guarantees to Oakley the due and punctual
payment of the  Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee by Payor when the
same shall  become due and payable. Guarantor\'s liability hereunder shall be
and is  specifically limited to payment of the Termination and Expense 
Reimbursement Fee required to be made in accordance with the terms of
the    1     Merger Agreement. The Guarantor and Oakley agree that this
Guarantee  constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection. The
Guarantor  agrees to pay, on demand, and to save Oakley harmless against
liability  for, any and all costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of  counsel) incurred or expended by or on behalf of Oakley in
connection with  the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this
Guarantee.  3. GUARANTEE ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL. (a) The Guarantor
hereby agrees that  its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional,
irrevocable, and  absolute, irrespective of (i) the validity or
enforceability of the Merger  Agreement, (ii) any amendment to or
modification of any of the terms or  provisions of the Merger Agreement,
(iii) the absence of any action to  enforce the Merger Agreement against the
Payor, (iv) any waiver or consent  by Oakley with respect to any provisions
of the Merger Agreement, or (v)  any other act or thing or omission, or delay
to do any other act or thing,  which may or might in any manner or to any
extent either vary the risk of  the Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the
obligations provided for in  this Guarantee or otherwise operate as a
discharge of the Guarantor as a  matter of law or equity (other than the
indefeasible payment in full in  cash of all of its obligations under this
Guarantee). The Guarantor hereby  waives demand of and protest of the
Termination and Expense Reimbursement  Fee and also waives notice of protest
for nonpayment, any right to require  a proceeding first against the Payor,
and all demands whatsoever and  covenants that this Guarantee will not be
discharged except by complete  performance of the obligation to pay the
Termination and Expense  Reimbursement Fee in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.  4. TERMINATION. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and
effect until the  earliest to occur of: (i) the indefeasible payment in full
of the entire  Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee, (ii) termination of
the Merger  Agreement in accordance with its terms without any obligation on
the part  of Payor to pay the Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee, or
(iii)  consummation of the Merger. Thereafter, Oakley shall take such action
and  execute such documents as the Guarantor may request in order to
evidence  the termination of this Guarantee.  5. REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES. Guarantor represents and warrants to, and  agrees with, Oakley
that:   (a) Guarantor is duly organized and validly existing as a
corporation  under the laws of Italy;   (b) Guarantor has duly taken all
necessary corporate action to authorize,  and has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and  deliver, this Guarantee and to perform
the obligations of Guarantor  pursuant to this Guarantee. This Guarantee has
been duly executed and  delivered by Guarantor and is the valid, binding and
enforceable  obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance  with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
(i)  bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors\' rights 
generally or (ii) general principles of equity, whether considered in  a
proceeding in equity or at law; and    2     (c) The execution and
delivery of this Guarantee by Guarantor, and its  performance of its
obligations under this Guarantee, do not and will  not (i) violate or
conflict with any provision of the charter  documents or bylaws of Guarantor
or (ii) violate or conflict with, or  constitute a breach of, any law, rule
or regulation, order, writ,  injunction, decree, award, or any agreement,
instrument, indenture,  deed or any other restriction, to which Guarantor is
subject or a  party.  6. SUBROGATION. The Guarantor shall be subrogated to
all rights of Oakley  against the Payor in respect of any amounts paid by the
Guarantor pursuant  to the provisions of this Guarantee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that so long as any  of the Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee shall
remain unsatisfied,  all rights of the Guarantor against the Payor based upon
such right of  subrogation shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in
right of  payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of the
Termination and  Expense Reimbursement Fee to Oakley.  7. REINSTATEMENT.
This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be  reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time payment, or any part  thereof, of any of the

liquidation or reorganization of the  Payor or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor  or conservator of, or trustee or
similar officer for, the Payor or any  substantial part of its property, or
otherwise, all as though such payments  had not been made.  8. PAYMENTS.

Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee, it will be paid to  Oakley, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the wire  transfer address
specified in a notice given by Oakley to it.  9. NOTICES. All notices,

provided by law.  13. SECTION HEADINGS. The section headings used in this
