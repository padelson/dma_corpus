equal to (i) the Deposit minus (ii) the Second Closing Base Purchase Price
(the " ** _First Closing Deposit Amount_** ") shall be released from the
Deposit Escrow Account and applied toward the First Closing Amount under
_Section 3.4(b)(i)_, and the remaining amount of the Deposit (equal to the

until the Second Closing occurs or the Agreement is terminated. If the Second
Closing occurs, then the remainder of the Deposit shall be applied toward the
Second Closing Amount under _Section 3.4(b)(ii)(B)_. If either the First
Closing or the Second Closing does not occur, the then remaining portion of
the Deposit shall be released as provided in _Section 12.2_.

the Defect Notice Deadline or (ii) the Second Defect Notice Deadline, as
applicable. Pursuant to part (ii) above, a Title Defect may only be raised

nature of the Title Defect, and any subsequent cure of such Title Defect by

Defect (if the cost to cure is reasonably determinable);

 



 

(c) the aggregate amount of Title Defect Values attributable to all Title
Defects affecting an Asset shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset;

 



 

(d) subject to the foregoing, if a Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance, or
other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, the Title Defect
Value shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien;

 



 

(e) if a Title Defect affects an Asset for less than its full productive life,
the Title Defect Value shall be reduced to take into account only the
applicable time period, using generally accepted engineering analysis and

other Title Defect Value calculated hereunder with respect to such Acquired
Asset based on or arising out of the same underlying objections to title of
Seller; and

 



 

(h) Subject to _Sections 5.4(a)_ through _(g)_ above, if a Title Defect as

(i) a negative discrepancy between the actual Net Revenue Interest for any
Acquired Lease and the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit
A-1_ for such Acquired Lease, then the Title Defect Value shall be equal to
the product of (A) the Net Mineral Acre Price thereof, multiplied by (B) the
number of Net Mineral Acres of such Acquired Lease subject to such Title
Defect, multiplied by (C) a fraction, the numerator of which is (1) the
remainder of (x) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such
Acquired Lease minus (y) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Acquired
Lease after giving effect to such Title Defect and the denominator of which is
(2) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such Acquired Lease;

 



 

(ii) a negative discrepancy between the actual Net Revenue Interest for any
First Closing Well or Second Closing Well and the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_ for such well, then the Title Defect Value
shall be equal to the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such well,
multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is (1) the remainder of
(x) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_ for such well minus (y)
the actual Net Revenue Interest for such well after giving effect to such
Title Defect, and the denominator of which is (2) the Net Revenue Interest
stated in _Exhibit A-2_ for such well; and

 



 

(iii) a reduction in the number of Net Mineral Acres as to any Acquired Lease
(or portion thereof), then the Title Defect Value for such Title Defect shall
be equal to the product of (A) the Net Mineral Acre Price therefore multiplied

included in such Acquired Lease as set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ minus (2) the
actual number of Net Mineral Acres included in such Acquired Lease after
giving effect to such Title Defect.

 



 

5.5 _Title Defects Notices_.

 



 

(a) As a condition to asserting any claim with respect to any alleged Title
Defect, Purchaser must deliver to Seller one or more valid written notices as
to alleged Title Defects (each, a " ** _Notice of Title Defects_** ") no later
than (i) 5:00 p.m., Denver, Colorado time, on June 1, 2016, (the " ** _Defect
Notice Deadline_** ") with respect to First Closing Assets, and (ii) the
Second Defect Notice Deadline, with respect to Second Closing Assets;
_provided_ that Purchaser agrees to provide Seller with periodic (but in no
event less frequently than once every week) updates in writing concerning the
progress of Purchasers title due diligence. Other than with respect to
Purchasers title due diligence prior to the Defect Notice Deadline,
Purchasers title due diligence with respect to the Second Closing Assets
shall only take place during the Second Defect Review Period.

Title Defects affecting the Assets that Purchaser desires to assert under this
Agreement and all Interest Additions discovered by Purchaser or of which
Purchaser has been notified under _Section 5.8_. Each Notice of Title Defects
shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, with respect to each such Title
Defect or Interest Addition set forth therein: (i) describe such Title Defect
or Interest

 



      
 

 



 

Addition and the Assets affected thereby; (ii) describe the basis of such
Title Defect or Interest Addition; (iii) include documentation supporting the
basis of such Title Defect or Interest Addition; (iv) in the case of a Title
Defect, describe in general terms the curative actions that Purchaser
reasonably anticipates are required to cure such Title Defect; (v) in the case

Addition, describe Purchasers good faith estimate of the value of such
Interest Addition.

(a) _Waiver_. Without limitation of Purchasers rights under the special
warranty of title in the Assignment, a Title Defect shall be and is hereby

such Title Defect in accordance with _Section 5.5(a)_ on or before the Defect
Notice Deadline or the Second Defect Notice Deadline, as applicable; (ii) the
Title Defect Value with respect to such Title Defect is less than the Title

the date thirty (30) days after the First Closing Date, and (ii) with respect
to the Second Closing Assets on or before the Second Closing Date. Except in
the case that Seller and Purchaser agree under _Section 5.7_ on the Title
Defect Values for all Open Title Defects (excluding those that have been
waived or previously cured under this _Section 5.6_), then Seller shall have
an additional period from until (x) the First Closing Settlement Date to
attempt to cure and to cure any such Title Defects with respect to the First
Closing Assets and (y) the Second Closing Settlement Date to attempt to cure
and to cure any such Title Defects with respect to the Second Closing Assets.
A Title Defect that is not waived under _Section 5.6(a)_ or cured under this
_Section 5.6(b)_ in accordance with the time limitations set forth in this
_Section 5.6(b)_ is referred to in this Agreement as a " ** _Surviving Title
Defect._** " With respect to any Title Defect occurring as a result of Seller
being entitled to less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit C_
for a specific Asset, the Parties agree that NBL Energy Royalties, Inc. may
cure such Title Defect by conveying an valid override to Purchaser in an
amount equal to the Net Revenue Interest discrepancy for such Asset.

 



 

(c) _Adjustment; Deductible_. Purchaser shall be entitled to a downward
adjustment to (i) the First Closing Base Purchase Price by the Defect
Adjustment, if any, with respect to the First Closing Assets and (ii) the
Second Closing Base Purchase Price by the Defect Adjustment, if any, with
respect to the Second Closing Assets. The " ** _Defect Adjustment_** " shall
be the amount by which: (x) the difference of the following (the " ** _Net
Aggregate Defect Value_** "): (A) the sum of the Title Defect Values with
respect to all Surviving Title Defects _minus_ the sum of the value of all
Interest Additions (in the event the amount of (A) is less than zero, then (A)
shall be deemed to be zero), _plus_ (B) the sum of all Environmental Defect
Values with respect to all Surviving Environmental Defects; _exceeds_ (y) the
Defect Deductible. If, after taking into account the provisions of this
_Article 5_ and _Article 6_, the Defect Deductible is equal to or greater
than the Net Aggregate Defect Value, then Purchaser shall not be entitled to a
Defect Adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Aggregate Defect Value
shall be determined by taking into account Title Defects and Environmental
Defects related to both the First Closing Assets and Second

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Assets on a cumulative basis. In no event shall any Acquired Assets be
excluded from the Contemplated Transactions arising out of or relating to any
Title Defects

 



 

5.7 _Agreement on Title Defects and Interest Additions_.

 



 

(a) _Attempt to Agree_. With respect to each Title Defect that the Parties do
not agree has been waived or cured under _Section 5.6_ (each, an " ** _Open
Title Defect_** ") and each Interest Addition, from the receipt by Seller of
Purchasers Notice of Title Defects until (i) the First Closing Settlement
Date with respect to the First Closing Assets and (ii) the Second Closing
Settlement Date with respect to the Second Closing Assets, or the earlier
acknowledgement of Purchaser in writing that it is not entitled to a Defect
Adjustment, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree on the
existence and associated Title Defect Value of each such Open Title Defect,
and the existence and associated value of each such Interest Addition.

 



 

(b) _Agreement_. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the existence and Title
Defect Value of any such Open Title Defect, then the Title Defect Value for
such Open Title Defect shall be the agreed Title Defect Value for purposes of
determining the Defect Adjustment, if any. If Seller and Purchaser agree on
the existence and value of any Interest Addition, then the value of such
Interest Addition shall be the agreed upon value for purposes of determining
the Defect Adjustment, if any. Upon any such agreement, Seller and Purchaser
shall execute a written instrument reflecting such agreement.

 



 

(c) _Agreement Before Closing_. If, before the First Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser agree on (i) the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title
Defects with respect to the First Closing Assets, (ii) the existence and value
of all Interest Additions with respect to the First Closing Assets and (iii)
the existence and Environmental Defect Values of all Open Environmental
Defects with respect to the First Closing Assets, then the amount of the
Defect Adjustment, if any, shall be deducted from the First Closing Base
Purchase Price at the First Closing, and shall be reflected in the First
Closing Amount. If, before the Second Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser agree
on (i) the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title Defects with
respect to the Second Closing Assets, (ii) the existence and value of all
Interest Additions with respect to the Second Closing Assets and (iii) the
existence and Environmental Defect Values of all Open Environmental Defects
with respect to the Second Closing Assets, then the amount of the Defect
Adjustment, if any, shall be deducted from the Second Closing Base Purchase
Price at the Second Closing, and shall be reflected in the Second Closing
Amount.

 



 

(d) _Failure to Agree_. If, (i) before the First Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser do not agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open
Title Defects with respect to the First Closing Assets, and the existence and
value of all Interest Additions with respect to the First Closing Assets, or
(ii) before the Second Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser do not agree on the
existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title Defects with respect to
the Second Closing Assets, and the existence and value of all Interest
Additions with respect to the Second Closing Assets then: (x) the existence
and Title Defect Value of those Open Title Defects that are not agreed (but
only those that are not agreed), and the existence and value of those Interest
Additions that are not agreed (but only those that are not agreed), shall be
Title Disputed Matters settled by the Title Expert under _Section 5.9_; (y)
there shall be no adjustment to the First Closing Amount or Second Closing
Amount, as applicable, or exclusion of Assets for any such Open Title Defects
or Interest Additions; and (z) the First Closing Base Purchase Price or Second
Closing Base Purchase Price, as applicable, shall be adjusted downward
pursuant to the final settlement under _Section 14.1_ by the amount of the
Defect Adjustment, if any, based on the Title Defect Values of any Surviving
Title Defects, and the values of any Interest Additions, in each case

 



      
 

 



 

determined under this _Section 5.7_ or _Section 5.9_, as applicable;
_provided, however_ , that any such Surviving Title Defects that are cured by
Seller under _Section 5.6(b)_, as applicable, shall not be considered
Surviving Title Defects and shall be and are hereby waived.

 



 

5.8 _Interest Additions_.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Interest Additions_. If Purchaser or Seller discovers any
additional interests in the Assets that are not listed in _Exhibit A_,
including any interest that entitles Seller to receive more than the Net
Revenue Interest with respect to any such Asset set forth in _Exhibit A-2_,
or obligates Seller to bear costs and expenses in an amount less than the
Working Interest with respect to any such Asset set forth in _Exhibit A-2_,
and assuming no corresponding reduction in the Net Revenue Interest (each an "
** _Interest Addition_** "), the discovering Party shall promptly after
discovery (but in any event before the Defect Notice Deadline or the Second
Defect Notice Deadline, as applicable), provide written notice to the other
Party of such Interest Addition. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
include: (i) a description of each such Interest Addition; (ii) the basis for
each such Interest Addition, and supporting documentation with respect
thereto; (iii) the Assets and the Allocated Value of the Assets affected by
each such Interest Addition; and (iv) the value of the Interest Addition or
the amount by which the notifying Party reasonably believes the Allocated
Value of the affected Assets should be increased by the Interest Addition, and
the computations upon which and Party belief is based.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Interest Additions_. There shall be no increase to the First
Base Purchase Price or Second Base Purchase Price as a result of any Interest
Additions. Interest Additions shall be offset against Title Defect Values in
determining the Defect Adjustment, if any, as provided in _Section 5.6(c)_.
An Interest Addition need not be contained in Purchasers Notice of Title
Defects to be taken into account; _provided, however_ , that an Interest
Addition shall only be taken into account if Purchaser has notice or actual
knowledge of such Interest Addition before the Defect Notice Deadline or the
Second Defect Notice Deadline, as applicable.

 



 

5.9 _Dispute Resolution_. If (1) any Open Title Defects, including the
existence, waiver, cure, and Title Defect Values thereof, or any Interest
Additions, including the existence and values thereof (collectively, " **
_Title Disputed Matters_** "), are not agreed upon under _Section 5.7_ and
neither Party has elected to terminate under _Section 6.7_, then any such
Title Disputed Matters or (2) Purchaser timely delivers a Purchaser Defect
Termination Notice and Seller delivers a Termination Dispute Notice, then any
Unagreed Termination Title Matters, shall, in each case be resolved by a
single Title Expert under the dispute resolution procedure in this _Section
5.9_.

 



 

(a) _Selection of Expert_. Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to
promptly execute such engagement letters and other documents as shall be
necessary to engage the Title Expert within thirty (30) Business Days after
the First Closing or Second Closing, as applicable, (or in the case of a
Termination Dispute Notice, within thirty (30) Business Days after the
delivery by Seller of such Termination Dispute Notice). After the Title Expert
has been engaged, if the Title Expert withdraws after a challenge, dies, or
otherwise resigns or is removed, then such Title Expert shall be replaced
within five (5) Business Days thereafter by Purchaser and Seller in accordance
with this _Section 5.9_, and the time periods in this _Section 5.9_ shall be
extended as necessary or appropriate. The fees and expenses of the Title
Expert shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser.

 



 

(b) _Materials to Title Expert_. Within forty five (45) Business Days after
the First Closing Date or Second Closing Date, as applicable, (or in the case
of a Termination Dispute Notice, within twenty (20) Business Days after the
delivery by Seller of such Termination Dispute Notice), the Parties shall
provide to the Title Expert the following materials:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Purchasers Notice of Title Defects and all documentation provided
therewith and such evidence as Purchaser deems appropriate to validate the
existence, and alleged Title Defect Values with respect to all Open Title
Defects, and the Interest Additions and values with respect thereto (or in the
case of a Termination Dispute Notice, Unagreed Termination Title Matters), in
each case assigned thereto by Purchaser in its Notice of Title Defects,
together with Purchasers good faith estimate of the values with respect to
all such Interest Additions identified by Seller, if any (or in the case of a
Termination Dispute Notice, Unagreed Termination Title Matters);

 



 

(ii) such evidence as Seller deems appropriate to dispute the existence,
waiver, cure, and alleged Title Defect Values with respect to all Open Title
Defects, and the Interest Additions and values with respect thereto (or in the
case of a Termination Dispute Notice, Unagreed Termination Title Matters), in
each case assigned thereto by Purchaser in its Notice of Title Defects,
together with Sellers good faith estimate of the Title Defect Values with
respect to all such Open Title Defects, if any, and the values with respect to
all such Interest Additions identified by Purchaser, if any (or in the case of
a Termination Dispute Notice, Unagreed Termination Title Matters); and

 



 

(iii) this _Article 5_, and _Exhibits A-1_ , _A-2_ , _A-3_ , _A-4_ , _A-5_ ,
and _C_ to this Agreement, together with any definitions of terms used in this
_Article 5_ and such Exhibits, but no other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Decisions of Title Expert_. The Title Expert shall make his or her
determination and provide to the Parties written findings within twenty (20)
Business Days after he has received the materials under _Section 5.9(b)_. The
decision of the Title Expert shall be final and non-appealable and shall be
limited to awarding only Sellers position or Purchasers position with
respect to the Title Disputed Matters associated with each Open Title Defect
and Interest Addition (or in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice, each
Unagreed Termination Title Matter), in each case that are not agreed upon by
the Parties under _Section 5.7_ or _Section 6.7_, as applicable. The Title
Expert shall make a separate determination with respect to each Open Title
Defect and Interest Addition (or in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice,
each Unagreed Termination Title Matter). The written finding of the Title
Expert shall only set forth the Title Experts decision with respect to each
applicable Open Title Defect and Interest Addition (or in the case of a
Termination Dispute Notice, each Unagreed Termination Title Matter), and not
the Title Experts rationale for the decision. The Title Expert shall not make
any other award or grant any other remedy, whether or not prohibited or
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall certify, as necessary, the
resolution of such Title Disputed Matters (or in the case of a Termination
Dispute Notice, such Unagreed Termination Title Matters), as applicable, to
the Accounting Referee under _Section 14.1_.

 



 

5.10 _Special Warranty of Title in the Assignments_.

 



 

(a) Each Assignment delivered at each applicable Closing will contain a
special warranty of Defensible Title whereby Seller shall warrant Defensible
Title to its interest in the applicable Acquired Properties assigned
thereunder unto Purchaser against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or
to claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under Seller but not
otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Liens. The special warranty of
Defensible Title contained in each Assignment shall be subject to the further
limitations and provisions of this _Article 5_, _mutatis mutandis_ ,
including the Title Defect Threshold and the Defect Deductible.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) No later than the date twelve (12) months after the applicable Closing
Date, Purchaser may furnish Seller a Notice of Title Defect meeting the
requirements of _Section 5.5(a)_ setting forth any matters which Purchaser
asserts as a breach of the special warranty of Defensible Title set forth in
the Assignment delivered at such Closing. Seller shall have a reasonable
opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure prior to the Final Settlement
Date any alleged breach of such special warranty of Defensible Title pursuant
to _Section 5.6(b)_. Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of
Sellers special warranty of Defensible Title set forth in any Assignment for
which Seller has not received on or before the date twelve (12) months after
the applicable Closing Date such Assignment was delivered a valid Notice of
Title Defects that satisfies the requirements set forth in _Section 5.5(a)_.

 



 

(c) For purposes of the special warranty of Defensible Title contained in any
Assignment, the value of the Acquired Assets set forth in the exhibits
thereto, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as
adjusted herein. Recovery on the special warranty of Defensible Title
contained in any Assignment shall be limited to an amount (without any
interest accruing thereon) equal to the reduction in the Second Closing Base
Purchase Price to which Purchaser would have been entitled had Purchaser
asserted the Title Defect giving rise to such breach of the special warranty
of Defensible Title contained in such Assignment, as a Title Defect prior to
the Defect Notice Deadline or the Second Defect Notice Deadline, as
applicable, pursuant to _Section 5.5_, in each case without regard to the
Title Defect Threshold or the Defect Deductible.

 



 

5.11 _Changes in Prices; Well Events_. Purchaser shall assume all risk of Loss
with respect to: (a) changes in commodity or product prices and any other
market factors or conditions from and after April 1, 2016; (b) production
declines or any adverse change in the production characteristics or downhole
condition of an Acquired Well, including any Acquired Well watering out, or
experiencing a collapse in the casing or sand infiltration, from and after
April 1, 2016; and (c) depreciation of any Acquired Assets that constitute
personal property through ordinary wear and tear, and none of the foregoing
shall constitute Title Defects or otherwise give rise to any Claims by
Purchaser before, on, or after any Closing.

 



 

5.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE
ASSIGNMENTS, THIS _Article 5_ SHALL, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY OF PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO
TITLE DEFECTS AND OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN TITLE WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED
ASSETS. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE ASSIGNMENTS AND AS
PROVIDED IN THIS _Article 5_, PURCHASER RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER
DISCHARGES SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
STOCKHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS, AND
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS,
CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF
ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER
MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF,
ANY TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER DEFICIENCY IN TITLE TO ANY ASSET. ** NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING HEREIN OR ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT DOES
SELLER MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE EASEMENTS
EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF DEFENSIBLE TITLE SET FORTH IN THE
ASSIGNMENTS.**

 



      
 

 



 

 **Article 6 _ 
Environmental Matters_**

 



 

6.1 _Environmental Investigation_.

 



 

(a) _Environmental Reports and Personnel_. Subject to _Section 4.1(b)_, and
(i) until the Defect Notice Deadline, with respect to Purchasers
environmental due diligence regarding the First Closing Assets, and (ii)
during the Second Defect Review Period with respect to Purchasers
environmental due diligence regarding the Second Closing Assets, Seller shall
provide Purchaser with access during the regular business hours of Seller to
all information in Sellers possession or control pertaining to the
Environmental Condition of the Acquired Assets, including any environmental
reports, Permits, Records, notices of violation from the Governmental
Authorities, and assessments, and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
(but in no event required to make any payments or incur any material
obligations owed to any Person) to make available to Purchaser those Entity
Representatives of Seller who would reasonably be expected to have material
knowledge or material information regarding the environmental status or
condition of the Acquired Assets.

 



 

(b) _Environmental Assessment_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser may, or may engage a qualified environmental contractor to,
conduct Phase I Environmental Site Assessments in accordance with the American
Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) Standard Practice Environmental
Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process (Publication
Designation: E1527-05) of the Acquired Assets (an " ** _Environmental
Assessment_** ") at Purchasers sole risk, Liability, and expense; _provided,
however_ , that: (i) Purchaser shall provide Seller with prior written notice
of any activities with respect to any such Environmental Assessment, and shall
provide Seller the opportunity to participate in all such activities; (ii) any
contractor engaged to perform all or any portion of such Environmental
Assessment shall execute and deliver to Seller a confidentiality agreement in
a form acceptable to Seller acting reasonably; (iii) Purchaser shall not
conduct, authorize, or permit any test drilling, sampling, or other on-site
activities without prior written notice to Seller, and the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may be granted, conditioned or withheld at
the sole discretion of Seller; and (iv) Purchaser shall provide to Seller
promptly (and in any event, within three Business Days) after receipt, at no
cost to Seller, all draft and final reports, results, data, analyses of site
visits, Remediation cost estimates, and any other portion of such
Environmental Assessment, all of which shall be subject to the confidentiality
provisions in _Section 10.13_. If the First Closing does not occur, Purchaser
shall promptly return to Seller or destroy all copies of the records, reports,
summaries, evaluations, due diligence memos and derivative materials related
thereto in the possession or control of Purchaser or any of Purchasers Entity
Representatives. If the Second Closing does not occur, Purchaser shall
promptly return to Seller or destroy all copies of the records, reports,
summaries, evaluations, due diligence memos and derivative materials related
to the Second Closing Assets in the possession or control of Purchaser or any
of Purchasers Entity Representatives. Any disturbance to the Assets
(including the leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Purchasers due
diligence will be promptly corrected by Purchaser.

 



 

(ii) In the event that Purchasers Environmental Assessment identifies actual
or potential "recognized environmental conditions" with respect to any Asset,
then Purchaser may request in writing (" ** _Phase II Request_** ") Sellers
permission to conduct a

 



      
 

 



 

Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to further assess such conditions. Such
Phase II Request will state with reasonable specificity (i) the actual or
potential "recognized environmental conditions" identified and (ii) the
proposed scope of the Phase II assessment, including a description of the
activities to be conducted, and a description of the approximate location and
expected timing of such activities. Seller may, in its sole discretion,
approve said Phase II assessment plan, in whole or in part, and Purchaser
shall not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan
until such time that Seller has approved such plan in writing. Any such
approved Phase II assessment plan shall be conducted by a reputable
environmental consulting or engineering firm. Seller shall have the right to
(x) condition any approval of the Phase II assessment plan on the provision of
proof of satisfactory insurance and (y) if said plan is approved by Seller,
have its representatives witness all on-site activities set forth in such
Phase II assessment plan and split any samples collected in connection
therewith. If Seller does not provide its consent to any Phase II Request
delivered in accordance with the above terms within two (2) Business Days of
Purchasers delivery of such request, then the affected Asset (or portion
thereof) for which consent is not provided shall be excluded from the Assets
to be conveyed at Closing, in which case, such Asset (or portion thereof so
affected) shall become an Excluded Asset, and at Closing, the Allocated Value
of all Assets excluded pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall be deducted
from the Base Purchase Price and the Asset shall be deemed deleted from the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto; _provided_ , however that the removal of any
such Asset pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall not be taken into account
in determining whether the Title/Environmental Termination Threshold has been
met or exceeded.

 



 

6.2 _Environmental Defect_. " ** _Environmental Defect_** " means the failure
of Sellers ownership and operation of the Acquired Assets to be in material
compliance as of 5:00 p.m., Denver, Colorado, time on April 1, 2016 with
applicable Environmental Laws in effect as of the Execution Date, but
excluding the following (which shall not constitute Environmental Defects):
(x) any Plugging and Abandonment Obligations; (y) the presence or absence of
naturally occurring radioactive material, radon gas and asbestos (" **
_NORM_** ") in or on the Acquired Assets; and (z) any matter that is subject
to or covered by the Consent Decree. An Environmental Defect may only be
raised after the Defect Notice Deadline and during the Second Defect Review
Period if such Environmental Defect relates to a Second Closing Asset. An
Environmental Defect may only be alleged after the Defect Notice Deadline and
during the Second Defect Review Period if such Environmental Defect relates to
a Second Closing Asset. Environmental Defects relating to Second Closing
Assets may only be alleged during the Second Defect Review Period.

 



 

6.3 _Environmental Defect Value_. " ** _Environmental Defect Value_** " means,
with respect to an Environmental Defect, the amount equal to the estimated
costs and expenses of Seller (based on the reasonable proportionate cost to
Seller) that would be incurred by Seller to Remediate or otherwise cure such
Environmental Defect in the lowest cost manner reasonably available, (x)
consistent with applicable Environmental Laws, taking into account (i) the
nature of the Environmental Defect, (ii) the likelihood that such
Environmental Defect actually will result in a Claim or Liability by any
Governmental Authority or any other third-party, (iii) any subsequent
Remediation or cure of the Environmental Defect by Seller within the time
frames permitted under this Agreement and (iv) that non-permanent remedies
(including without limitation, mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous
Materials, including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-
based corrective action, institutional controls, or other appropriate
restrictions on the industrial use of the property, caps, dikes,
encapsulation, lechate collection systems, and the like) may be the lowest
cost manner reasonably available and, (y) where applicable, to the
satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Authorities.

 



       
 

 



 

6.4 _Environmental Defect Notices_.

 



 

(a) As a condition to asserting any claim with respect to any alleged
Environmental Defect, Purchaser must deliver to Seller a valid written Notice
of Environmental Defect as to any alleged Environmental Defect no later than
(i) the Defect Notice Deadline, with respect to First Closing Assets, and (ii)
the Second Defect Notice Deadline, with respect to Second Closing Assets.

 



 

(b) On or before the Defect Notice Deadline or Second Defect Notice Deadline,
as applicable, for any alleged Environmental Defect, Purchaser shall deliver
to Seller a valid written notice (a " ** _Notice of Environmental Defects_**
") that sets forth all Environmental Defects affecting the Acquired Assets
that Purchaser desires to assert under this Agreement. In order to be valid,
the Notice of Environmental Defects shall, with respect to each Environmental
Defect set forth therein: (i) describe the nature of and basis for such
Environmental Defect; (ii) describe the specific Assets affected by such
Environmental Defect; (iii) references to the specific provisions and sections
of Environmental Laws that Seller or the Acquired Assets are in violation of
or non-compliance with that forms the basis of such Environmental Defect; (iv)
describe the Remediation or other curative action that Purchaser reasonably
anticipates is required to Remediate or otherwise cure such Environmental
Defect; (v) describe Purchasers good-faith estimate of the Environmental
Defect Value with respect to each Acquired Asset affected by such
Environmental Defect; and (vi) include all documentation supporting the nature
and basis of such Environmental Defect and the estimate of its Environmental
Defect Value.

 



 

6.5 _Waiver; Remediation; Adjustment; Deductible_.

 



 

(a) _Waiver_. An Environmental Defect shall be and is hereby conclusively
waived by Purchaser, Purchaser shall not be entitled to any remedies or
adjustment for such Environmental Defect or to exclude the Acquired Asset
affected by such Environmental Defect, and Seller shall not be obligated to
cure such Environmental Defect, if: (i) Purchaser fails to provide written
notice to Seller of such Environmental Defect in accordance with _Section
6.4(b)_ on or before the Defect Notice Deadline or Second Defect Notice
Deadline, as applicable, or (ii) the Environmental Defect Value with respect
to such Environmental Defect is less than the Environmental Defect Threshold.
Except as specifically set forth in _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section
6.5(d)_, in no event shall any Acquired Assets be excluded from the
Contemplated Transactions arising out of or relating to any Environmental
Defects.

 



 

(b) _Remediation_. Seller shall have the right and option, but not the
obligation, to attempt to Remediate or otherwise cure, and to Remediate or
otherwise cure, any Environmental Defects that are not waived under _Section
6.5(a)_ (i) with respect to the First Closing Assets on or before the date
thirty (30) days after the First Closing Date, and (ii) with respect to the
Second Closing Assets on or before the Second Closing Date. Except in the case
that Seller and Purchaser agree under _Section 6.6_ on the Environmental
Defect Values for all Open Environmental Defects (excluding those that have
been waived or previously cured under this _Section 6.5_), then Seller shall
have an additional period until the First Closing Settlement Date, with
respect to First Closing Assets, and until the Second Closing Settlement Date,
with respect to Second Closing Assets, to attempt to Remediate or otherwise
cure, and to Remediate or otherwise cure, any such Environmental Defects. An
Environmental Defect that is not waived under _Section 6.5(a)_ or Remediated
or otherwise cured under this _Section 6.5(b)_ is referred to in this
Agreement as a " ** _Surviving Environmental Defect._** "

 



 

(c) _Adjustment; Deductible_. Purchaser shall be entitled to a downward
adjustment to (i) the First Closing Base Purchase Price by the Defect
Adjustment, if any, with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

First Closing Assets and (ii) the Second Closing Base Purchase Price by the
Defect Adjustment, if any, with respect to the Second Closing Assets as
provided in _Section 5.6(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Defect
Adjustment shall be determined by taking into account Environmental Defects
related to both the First Closing Assets and Second Closing Assets on a
cumulative basis.

 



 

(d) _Exclusion of Assets_. In the event the Environmental Defect Value as
determined by Purchaser in good faith and included in the applicable Notice of
Environmental Defects for any Asset is equal to or exceeds the Allocated Value
of such Asset, then either Party shall have the option to elect by written
notice to the other Party no later than three (3) Business Days after the
Defect Notice Deadline or Second Defect Notice Deadline, as applicable, to
have the affected Asset (or portion thereof subject to the Environmental
Defect) excluded from the Assets to be conveyed at Closing, in which case,
such Asset (or portion thereof so affected) shall become an Excluded Asset,
and at Closing, the Allocated Value of all Assets excluded pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(b)_ shall be deducted from the Base Purchase Price and the Asset
shall be deemed deleted from the Exhibits and Schedules hereto; _provided_ ,
however that the removal of any such Asset pursuant to this _Section 6.5(d)_
shall not be taken into account in determining whether the Title/Environmental
Termination Threshold has been met or exceeded.

 



 

6.6 _Agreement on Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(a) _Attempt to Agree_. With respect to each Environmental Defect that the
Parties do not agree has been waived or Remediated or otherwise cured under
_Section 6.5_ (each, an " ** _Open Environmental Defect_** "), from the
receipt by Seller of Purchasers Notice of Environmental Defects until (i) the
First Closing Settlement Date with respect to the First Closing Assets and
(ii) the Second Closing Settlement Date with respect to the Second Closing
Assets, or the earlier acknowledgement of Purchaser in writing that it is not
entitled to a Defect Adjustment, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to agree on the existence and associated Environmental Defect Value of
each such Open Environmental Defect.

 



 

(b) _Agreement_. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the existence and
Environmental Defect Value of any such Open Environmental Defect, then the
Environmental Defect Value for such Open Environmental Defect shall be the
agreed Environmental Defect Value for purposes of determining the Defect
Adjustment, if any. Upon any such agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall
execute a written instrument reflecting such agreement.

 



 

(c) _Agreement Before Closing_. If, before the First Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser agree on (i) the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title
Defects with respect to the First Closing Assets, (ii) the existence and value
of all Interest Additions with respect to the First Closing Assets and (iii)
the existence and Environmental Defect Values of all Open Environmental
Defects with respect to the First Closing Assets, then the amount of the
Defect Adjustment, if any, shall be deducted from the First Closing Base
Purchase Price at the First Closing, and shall be reflected in the First
Closing Amount. If, before the Second Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser agree
on (i) the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title Defects with
respect to the Second Closing Assets, (ii) the existence and value of all
Interest Additions with respect to the Second Closing Assets and (iii) the
existence and Environmental Defect Values of all Open Environmental Defects

the payment and reporting of Royalties and Taxes, the ability to develop the
Acquired Assets, to obtain any Permits required to develop the Acquired
Assets, or to sell any Hydrocarbons attributable to production from the
Acquired Assets, or of any projections as to events that could or could not
occur.

 



 

(c) In entering into this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that
it has relied and will rely solely on the terms of this Agreement and upon its
independent analysis, evaluation, and investigation of, and judgment with
respect to, the business, economic, legal, tax, environmental, and other
consequences of the Contemplated Transactions, including its own estimate and
appraisal of the extent and value of the Hydrocarbon and other reserves
attributable to the Acquired Assets and the prices that may be received for
Hydrocarbons produced from the Acquired Assets.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Seller
Parties shall not have any Liability to Purchaser, its Affiliates, any
Indemnified Purchaser Parties, or their respective Entity Representatives,
arising out of or resulting from any authorized or unauthorized use,
disclosure, or reliance on the Background Materials or other information and
data relating to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities provided by or
on behalf of Seller or any other Indemnified Seller Party.

 



 

9.10 _Securities Laws_. Purchaser has such knowledge, sophistication, and
experience in business and financial matters and in the ownership and
operation of oil and gas properties and assets that Purchaser is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the acquisition of the Acquired Assets, and
has so evaluated the merits and risks of such acquisition. Purchaser is able
to bear the economic risk of its acquisition of the Acquired Assets, and, at
the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment. The
Acquired Assets are being acquired by Purchaser for Purchasers own account
for the purpose of investment or consumption and not with a view to reselling
or distributing the Acquired Assets in violation of any registration or
qualification requirements of any securities Laws. Purchaser understands and
acknowledges that neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
nor any federal, state or foreign agency has passed upon the Acquired Assets
or made any finding or determination as to the fairness of an investment in
the Acquired Assets or the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made to
Purchaser, and, except as expressly set forth in _Article 12_, Purchaser
waives its right of rescission and is not entitled to cancel, terminate, or
revoke this Agreement.

 



 

9.11 _Qualification_. Purchaser is now or at the applicable Closing will be
and thereafter will continue to be qualified to own and operate the Acquired
Assets assigned to Purchaser at such Closing, including the federal, state,
and fee Acquired Leases, including meeting all Permit, bonding, and other
surety requirements. Consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by
Purchaser will not cause Purchaser to be disqualified or to exceed any acreage
limitations imposed by Law.

 



 

9.12 _Financial Resources_. Purchaser will, at each applicable Closing, have
the financial resources necessary to close the Contemplated Transaction and
perform all obligations of Purchaser hereunder and under the Agreements
executed by Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated Transaction.

performed after the First Closing shall be construed and deemed limited to
only the Second Closing Assets and not any First Closing Assets and (2) all
references to "Acquired Assets" in this _Section 10.1(a)_ shall automatically

(b) _Upon Closing_. Upon each Closing, Purchaser shall assume full Liability
and responsibility for all Operations of Seller with respect to the Acquired
Assets transferred to Purchaser at such Closing; _provided, however_ , that

agreements, as such will be controlled by the applicable joint operating
agreements.

_Section 10.1(a)(iii)_) shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned and shall be considered granted in full within ten (10) days
(unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such
shorter time is specified in Sellers notice) of Sellers notice to Purchaser
requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary
during that period. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller owns undivided
interests in the Acquired Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or
omissions of third parties (including the applicable operators of the Acquired
Assets) who are not Affiliates of Seller shall not constitute a violation of
the provisions of this _Section 10.2_ (or _Section 10.1(a)(iii)_), nor shall
any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a
violation so long as Seller and its Affiliates have voted their respective
interests in a manner consistent with the provisions of this _Section 10.2_.
_Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary_ , from and after the
occurrence of the First Closing, (1) the covenant set forth in this _Section
10.2_ to be performed after the First Closing shall be construed and deemed
limited to only the Second Closing Assets and not any First Closing Assets and

Assets providing for the sale of Hydrocarbons for a term in excess of one
month that cannot be cancelled or terminated on sixty (60) days or less

10.4 _Legal Status_. From the Execution Date until the Final Settlement Date,
Seller and Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to preserve

will not be subject to any material Entity, legal, or contractual restriction
that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

10.5 _Notices of Claims_. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller, if, at any time from the Execution
Date until the applicable Closing, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be,
receives notice of any Claim or Proceeding of the type described in _Section
8.8_ with respect to the Acquired Assets that have not assigned to Seller in
connection with an earlier Closing or _Section 9.8_.

 



 

10.6 _Compliance with Laws_. From the Execution Date until the applicable
Closing, Seller shall comply in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, Permits, and Orders relating to the ownership of the Acquired Assets,

10.9 _Material Required Consents_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date until the applicable Closing, Seller
shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts (but in no event required to
make any payments or incur any material obligations owed to any Person), with
reasonable assistance from Purchaser (including Purchaser providing required
assurances of financial condition and operator qualifications), to obtain all
Material Required Consents before such Closing. Purchaser shall bear and be
liable for, and the Assumed Liabilities shall include, any payments or
obligations required under the terms of the concerned contract that are owed

discovers any Material Required Consent that is not listed in _Section 8.1 of
the Disclosure Schedule_, Purchaser shall promptly after discovery give
written notice to Seller of such Material Required Consent, and _Section 8.1
of the Disclosure Schedule_ shall be deemed updated by the Material Required
Consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
failure to obtain a Material Required Consent before the applicable Closing
shall not constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant in
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If a Material Required Consent is not obtained before the applicable
Closing: (i) until the Final Settlement Date, Seller and Purchaser shall work
together in good faith to obtain such Material Required Consent (including, in
the case of Purchaser, providing reasonable or required assurance of financial
condition and operator qualifications); (ii) neither this Agreement nor any
other Transaction Document shall constitute an actual or attempted sale,
assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance, or delivery of the Acquired
Assets or Assumed Liabilities subject to the Material Required Consent; (iii)
until any such Material Required Consent is obtained, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed
to provide to Purchaser the benefits of the Acquired Assets and the burdens of
the Assumed Liabilities subject to the Material Required Consent; and (iv) the
First Closing Base Purchase Price or Second Closing Base Purchase Price, as

applicable Closing, (A) Seller shall assign, transfer, and convey to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall assume from Seller, the applicable Acquired
Asset or Assumed Liabilities covered by the Material Required Consent pursuant
to special-purpose assignment and assumption documents substantially
consistent with the Transaction Documents, and (B) Purchaser shall pay to
Seller the Allocated Value (or portion thereof) of the applicable Acquired
Asset affected by such Material Required Consent that was subtracted from the
First Closing Base Purchase Price or Second Closing Base Purchase Price, as

Asset or Assumed Liability shall not be transferred from Seller

 



      
 

 



 

to Purchaser under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and shall
be deemed to be excluded from the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities and
retained by Seller as an "Excluded Asset".

Rights set forth on _Section 8.2 of the Disclosure Schedule_, offering to
sell to each such Person that portion of the Acquired Assets for which such a
Preferential Right is held for an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
portion of the Acquired Assets.

 



 

(b) _Notification_. If, during the course of its Due Diligence Review,
Purchaser discovers any Preferential Right that is not set forth on _Section
8.2 of the Disclosure Schedule_ and which are applicable to the Acquired

Seller of such Preferential Right, whereupon Seller shall promptly thereafter
comply with such Preferential Right in accordance with _Section 10.10(a)_.

 



 

(c) _Consummation Before any Closing_. If, before the applicable Closing Date,
any Preferential Right affecting any portion of the Acquired Assets is
exercised and the sale to the holder of such Preferential Right is
consummated, then that portion of the Acquired Assets affected by such
Preferential Right shall be excluded from the Acquired Assets conveyed at such
Closing, and the Closing Amount shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated
Value of such portion of the Acquired Assets.

 



 

(d) _Consummation After Closing_. If, with respect to a Preferential Right
applicable to any portion of the Acquired Assets, the holder of such
Preferential Right timely and properly exercises such Preferential Right
before the applicable Closing Date but the purchase and sale of the affected
Acquired Assets to the holder of such Preferential Right is not consummated
before such Closing Date, then: (i) the First Closing Base Purchase Price or
Second Closing Base Purchase Price, as applicable, shall be reduced as a
result of such Preferential Right by the Allocated Value of such Acquired
Assets; (ii) the affected Acquired Asset shall be retained by Seller at such
Closing; (iii) if the sale of the affected Acquired Assets to the holder of
such Preferential Right occurs after such Closing but prior to the Final
Settlement Date, Seller shall satisfy the obligations to such holder related
to such Preferential Right, (iv) if the sale to the holder of the Preferential
Right is not consummated before the Final Settlement Date (including, if the
time frame for the exercise of the Preferential Right expires without exercise
before the Final Settlement Date), then in connection with the final
settlement under _Section 14.1_, the Seller shall convey such Acquired Asset
to Purchaser effective as of the Effective Time pursuant to an assignment and
conveyance substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ subject to such
Preferential Right, if still outstanding as of the Final Settlement Date, and
simultaneously with such conveyance Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
Allocated Value of such portion of the Acquired Assets.

 



 

(e) _Open Preferential Rights_. If, with respect to a Preferential Right
applicable to any portion of the Acquired Assets, the time frame for the
exercise of such Preferential Right has not expired before the applicable
Closing Date and Seller has not received from the holder of such Preferential
Right either a notice of such holders intent not to exercise such
Preferential Right or a waiver of such Preferential Right, then: (i) the First
Closing Base Purchase Price or Second Closing Base Purchase Price, as
applicable, shall not be reduced as a result of such

 



      
 

 



 

Preferential Right; (ii) the affected Acquired Asset shall be conveyed by
Seller to Purchaser at such Closing (to the extent applicable); and (iii)
Purchaser shall comply with, be responsible for and perform all obligations
arising with or attributable to such Preferential Right.

 



 

(f) _Certain Acknowledgements_. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller desires to
sell all of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser and would not have entered into
this Agreement but for Purchasers agreement to purchase all of the Acquired
Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is expressly understood and agreed
that Seller does not desire to sell any Acquired Assets affected by a
Preferential Right to Purchaser unless the sale of all of the Acquired Assets
is consummated by the applicable Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers obligation hereunder
to sell the Acquired Assets affected by a Preferential Rights to Purchaser is
expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the applicable Closing Date of

of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, either by
conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an applicable Preferential
Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to extend or
apply any Preferential Right to any portion of the Acquired Assets that is not
otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of the essence with respect to the
Parties agreement to consummate the sale of the Acquired Assets by the
Closing Date.

 



 

10.11 _Casualty Loss_. If, after the Execution Date and before any applicable
Closing, a Casualty Loss occurs with respect to a portion of the Acquired
Assets, then, notwithstanding such Casualty Loss, Purchaser and Seller shall

reduction of the First Closing Base Purchase Price or Second Closing Base
Purchase Price, as applicable,, and Seller shall: (a) pay to Purchaser at the
Closing all sums paid to Seller by Governmental Authorities and third parties
before such Closing by reason of such Casualty Loss; and (b) assign, transfer,
and convey to Purchaser all rights of Seller to any insurance proceeds
received by Seller, as well as all of the right, title, and interest of Seller
in and to any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds, or other payments
from Governmental Authorities or third parties arising out of such Casualty
Loss. Before any Closing, Seller shall not voluntarily compromise, settle, or
adjust any amounts payable by reason of any Casualty Loss without first
obtaining the written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

however_ , in no event shall Seller make any payments or incur any material

other Party at least ten (10) days prior written notice (unless less time is
permitted by the applicable Information Request, in which case the disclosing
Party shall give as much notice as is possible), together with a copy of the
Information Request. If, before the time such disclosure is required to be

year period ending on the First Closing that are in Sellers possession as may
be reasonably required in order for Purchaser and its Affiliates to prepare
such financial statements as may be required in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (the " ** _S-X
Financials_** ") and (ii) any documentation attributable to the Assets for the
five (5) year period ending on the First Closing to the extent required to
complete any audit associated with the S-X Financials, and (B) authorize and
instruct Sellers personnel and representatives (including accountants) to
cooperate in connection with the preparation of the S-X Financials and the
delivery of an audit report thereon (including the delivery of any required
management representation letter and attorney letter to auditor) and to assist
in connection with the response to any SEC comment letter in respect to the
S-X Financials; _provided, however_ , in no event shall Seller be require to
create, compile, or prepare any new financial reports, books, records or other
information that does not exist prior to such request by Purchaser. Requests
by Purchaser for cooperation, access and documentation pursuant to this
_Section 10.20_ shall be given with reasonable specificity and with
reasonable advance notice to Seller and Sellers representatives so as not to
unreasonably interfere with Sellers or any of Sellers representatives
conduct of business. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify,
defend and reimburse the Indemnified Seller Parties for all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including fees of any independent auditor) incurred by
Seller in providing access to the records, personnel, and accounting firm and
complying with the provisions of this _Section 10.20_, and shall reimburse
Seller these amounts within thirty (30) days after receiving an invoice
therefor.

 



 

10.21 _Gathering Agreements_. From the Execution Date until the First Closing,
each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate, execute
and deliver a mutually-acceptable amendment to each of the Affiliate Gathering
Agreements setting forth applicable individual fees for services defined
therein.

 



 

10.22 _Excluded Wellbores_. Sellers transfer to Purchaser of all of the
Second Closing Wells listed on _Exhibit A-2, Part 2_, in their entirety,
including related Equipment, is not permitted by the Consent Decree; however,
in order to comply with the terms of such Consent Decree, Seller shall, on or
before the Defect Notice Deadline, provide written notice to Purchaser (" **
_Wellbore Notice_** ") of certain Second Closing Wells described on _Exhibit
A-2, Part 2_ that will be removed from _Exhibit A-2, Part 2_, including
related Equipment, and will not be included in this transaction as Second
Closing Assets (the " ** _Excluded Wellbores_** "). Seller shall have the
ability to remove Second Closing Wells from _Exhibit A-2, Part 2_ pursuant to
such Wellbore Notice only to the extent necessary to comply with its
obligations under the Consent Decree. The remainder of the wellbores listed on
_Exhibit A-2, Part 2_ shall remain Second Closing Wells and subject to sale
to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Parties agree
that the Excluded Wellbores shall be excluded from the Second Closing Assets
to be conveyed at the Second Closing, in which case, such Excluded Wellbore
shall become an Excluded Asset, and at the Second Closing, the Allocated Value
of all Excluded Wellbores shall be deducted from the Second Closing Base
Purchase Price and the Excluded Wellbores shall be deemed deleted from the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto; provided, however that the removal of any such
Excluded Wellbore pursuant to this _Section 10.22_ shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the Title/Environmental Termination Threshold
has been met or exceeded. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in
this _Section 10.22_ shall be construed as diminishing Sellers obligation
contained in Section 4.1 of the Joint Use Agreement.

each Partys rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the

condition set forth in _Section 11.1(d)_ has been met; _provided, however_ ,
that no Party hereto shall be entitled to terminate such rights and
obligations under this _Section 12.1(b)_ if the Second Closing has failed to

to Seller from the Deposit Escrow Account in accordance with the Deposit
Escrow Agreement, which Deposit shall constitute liquidated damages for any
and all breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser and such remedy shall be the

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN CALCULATING THE ACTUAL

then the entirety of the remaining Deposit shall be released to Seller from
the Deposit Escrow Account in accordance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement,
which remaining Deposit shall constitute liquidated damages for any and all
breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser with respect to the failure of the
Second Closing to occur and such remedy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Seller for any such failure of Purchaser with respect to the
Second Closing; _provided, however_ , no such termination of such obligations
with respect to the Second Closing and the Second Closing Assets shall reduce,
modify, supplement or terminate any other obligations of the Parties hereunder

First Closing Assets, any Assumed Liabilities, any Excluded Assets or any
other rights or obligations of any Party hereunder other than those related to
the Second Closing and the Second Closing Assets. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT (i) SELLERS ACTUAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM SUCH TERMINATION WOULD
BE DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE AND (ii) THE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR

under any other Transaction Documents with respect to First Closing, the First
Closing Assets, any Assumed Liabilities, any Excluded Assets or any other
rights or obligations of any Party hereunder other than those related to the
Second Closing and the Second Closing Assets.

to Purchaser from the Deposit Escrow Account in accordance with the Deposit
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser under _Section 12.1(a)_
because the First Closing has not occurred solely as a result of the failure
or breach by Seller of any representations, warranties or covenants of Seller
set forth in this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of the

or relating to such breach or default and Purchaser shall have the right to
obtain a decree or order of specific performance, mandamus, or other

damage to Purchaser would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine, and the Purchaser shall be entitled

of any representations, warranties or covenants of Seller set forth in this
Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of the conditions of Purchaser
set forth in _Section 11.3_ with respect to the Second Closing, then, subject
to _Section 17.2_ and the other provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall
remain liable to Purchaser for all Losses incurred by Purchaser arising out of
or relating to such breach or default and Purchaser shall have the right to
obtain a decree or order of specific performance, mandamus, or other
injunctive relief or equitable remedy to enforce the observance and
performance of this Agreement against Seller. The Parties agree that if this
Agreement is terminated as provided in this _Section 12.2(f)_, irreparable
damage to Purchaser would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine, and the Purchaser shall be entitled
to seek specific

the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that Purchaser seeks damages at Law for any termination under this
_Section 12.2(f)_, the aggregate Liability of Seller for such damages under

the Contemplated Transactions from and after the termination of this Agreement

further Liability or obligation of any Party to any other Party; _provided,
however_ , that the provisions in _Sections 10.13_ and _10.14_ (relating to

obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Second Closing and the
Second Closing Assets are terminated by either Party under Section 12.1(b)

under any other

 



      
 

 



 

Transaction Document with respect thereto shall survive pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms hereof (including all obligations under _Article
16_); and

 



 

(iii) for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Parties under the
Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

binding, and conclusive; (ii) shall

Objection Report; and (iv) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete its work and deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written report of its

Dispute is submitted to the Accounting Referee under this _Section 14.1_,
then the Final First Closing Purchase Price or Final Second Closing Purchase
Price, as applicable, as determined by the Accounting Referee and set forth in
its report, shall be final, binding, and conclusive on all Parties.

Date with respect to the Final First Closing Purchase Price, the amount of
such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by Seller. If the Final First Closing Purchase Price as

offs by the purchaser of any such production against obligations of the
recipient of such cash that are not related to the purchase of such
production. Payments under this _Section 14.2_ shall not constitute an
adjustment to any portion of the Purchase Price. Adjustments to the Purchase
Price after the Second Closing shall be made only under _Section 14.1_.

 



 

14.3 _Records_. Seller shall make the First Closing Assets Records with
respect to the First Closing available for pick up by Purchaser at a mutually

and other Persons with an interest in pre-Effective Time production of
Hydrocarbons from the First Closing Properties or Second Closing Properties,
respectively, that Seller has been unable to pay because such Persons cannot

execute, acknowledge, and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged, and
delivered, to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge, and
deliver, and cause to be executed, acknowledged, and delivered to Seller, such
further documents and instruments, and take such other and further actions, as
may be reasonably requested by each such Party in order to more effectively
assure to Purchaser the full beneficial use and enjoyment of the applicable
Acquired Assets purchased by Purchaser, and to more effectively assure to
Seller the full assumption by Purchaser of, and release of Seller from, any
Liability with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, and to otherwise more fully

 **Article 15 _ 
Tax Matters_**

 



 

15.1 _Apportionment of Property Taxes_.

 



 

(a) _Oil and Gas Property Taxes_. The Parties acknowledge that, with respect
to the Acquired Assets that qualify as oil or gas leases or lands with the
meaning of Colorado Revised Statutes Section 39-7-101, Colorado Property Taxes
are measured with respect to Hydrocarbon production revenue from the leases or
lands during a calendar year, levied on January 1 of the subsequent calendar
year, and payable in the following year (" ** _Oil and Gas Property Taxes_**
"). Seller alone shall be liable for Oil and Gas Property Taxes attributable
to 2015 Hydrocarbon production revenue from the First Closing Assets, which
Taxes were levied in 2016 and will be payable in 2017, and the full amount of
these Oil and Gas Taxes attributable to 2015 Hydrocarbon production revenue
shall be reflected as a downward adjustment to the Base Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)(ii)(C)_. Oil and Gas Property Taxes attributable
to 2016 Hydrocarbon production revenue from the First Closing Assets, which
will be levied in 2017 and payable in 2018, shall be apportioned between the
Parties in proportion to the time period that each respective Party owned each
First Closing Asset during the 2016 taxable year, such that Seller shall be
liable for these Oil and Gas Property Taxes in proportion to the 2016
Hydrocarbon production revenue from each First Closing Asset prior to the
Effective Time applicable to that First Closing Asset, and Purchaser shall be
liable for these Oil and Gas Property Taxes in proportion to the 2016
Hydrocarbon production revenue arising from each First Closing Asset on and
after the Effective Time applicable to that First Closing Asset. The amount of
the Sellers liability for Oil and Gas Taxes attributable to 2016 Hydrocarbon
production revenue shall be reflected as a downward adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)(ii)(C)_. Buyer alone shall be
liable for Oil and Gas Property Taxes attributable to 2017 Hydrocarbon
production revenue from the First Closing Assets. For the purpose of
determining an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.2_
and/or _Section 14.1_, Oil and Gas Property Taxes for the 2017 tax year
(i.e., those based on the value of 2016 production, levied for the 2017 tax
year, and payable in 2018) shall be estimated based on the most recently
certified mill levy applicable to a First Closing Asset subject to Oil and Gas
Property Taxes and the value of the production attributable to a First Closing
Asset subject to Oil and Gas Property Taxes occurring prior to the Effective
Time (annualized by multiplying such value by four). For purposes of this
Agreement, the resulting Purchase Price adjustment under _Section 3.2_ and/or
_Section 14.1_ for the First Closing Assets will be the full and final
settlement of Sellers responsibility for all such Oil and Gas Property Taxes
without regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments (the " ** _Settled Oil
and Gas Property Taxes_** "). For the avoidance of doubt, the principles of
this _Section 15.1(a)_ shall be applied to the Second Closing Assets,
provided that if the Second Closing takes place in 2017, the Oil and Gas
Property Taxes attributable to 2016 Hydrocarbon production revenue from Second
Closing Assets shall be treated in the manner provided above for 2015
Hydrocarbon production revenue, and the Oil and Gas Property Taxes
attributable to 2017 Hydrocarbon production revenue from Second Closing Assets
shall be treated in the manner provided above for 2016 Hydrocarbon production
revenue, and if the Second Closing takes place in 2018, the Oil and Gas

 



      
 

 



 

Property Taxes attributable to 2017 Hydrocarbon production revenue from Second
Closing Assets shall be treated in the manner provided above for 2015
Hydrocarbon production revenue, and the Oil and Gas Property Taxes
attributable to 2018 Hydrocarbon production revenue from Second Closing Assets
shall be treated in the manner provided above for 2016 Hydrocarbon production
revenue.

 



 

(b) _Other Property Taxes_. Property Taxes on Acquired Assets other than those
described in _Section 15.1(a)_ (" ** _Other Property Taxes_** ") shall be
deemed attributable to the period of ownership by each Party of each
applicable Acquired Asset subject to Other Property Taxes, and liability for
such Other Property Taxes shall be allocated to Seller for all periods (and
portions thereof) ending prior to the Effective Time applicable to each
Acquired Asset and to Purchaser for all periods (and portions thereof)
beginning at or after the Effective Time applicable to each Acquired Asset. To
the extent the actual amount of an Other Property Taxes that are attributable
to a period ending prior to the Effective Time (but not due and payable prior
to the First Closing or Second Closing, as applicable) is not determinable at
the time an adjustment to the Purchase Price is to be made with respect to
such Other Property Taxes pursuant to Section 3.2 and/or Section 14.1, as
applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available in
estimating the amount of such Other Property Taxes for purposes of such
adjustment, and the amount of such Other Property Taxes used for purposes of
Section 3.2 and/or Section 14.1 shall be considered full and final settlement
of Sellers responsibility for all such Other Property Taxes without regard to
the actual Tax rates or assessments (the " ** _Settled Other Property Taxes_**
," and together with the Settled Oil and Gas Property Taxes, the " ** _Settled
Property Taxes_** ").

 



 

15.2 _Apportionment of Severance Taxes_. Severance Taxes shall be deemed
attributable to the period during which production occurred on Acquired Assets
of the Hydrocarbons subject to such Severance Taxes, and liability therefor
shall be allocated to Seller for Hydrocarbon production from each Acquired
Asset prior to the Effective Time applicable to that Acquired Asset, and to
Purchaser for Hydrocarbon production from each Acquired Asset on and after the
Effective Time applicable to that Acquired Asset. For the purpose of
calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price under _Section 3.2_ and/or
_Section 14.1_, Severance Taxes for which the actual liability amount is not
known as of such time shall be estimated based on current Colorado Severance
Tax rates with the resulting Purchase Price adjustment under _Section 3.2_
and/or _Section 14.1_ to be considered full and final settlement of all such
Taxes without regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments (the " ** _Settled
Severance Taxes_** ," and together with the Settled Property Taxes, the " **
_Settled Asset Taxes_** ") for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

15.3 _Tax Returns_. Subject to Purchasers indemnification rights under
Article XVI of this Agreement, after Closing, Purchaser shall timely file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for Asset Taxes required to be filed after
the Closing and shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the taxing authorities
all Asset Taxes that become due and payable after the Closing. Any penalty,
addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any Asset Tax
shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, the Party to which the Tax to
which such penalty, addition to Tax or interest relates is allocated,
regardless of when such penalty, addition to Tax, or interest is levied or
assessed; provided, however, that the liability for any penalty, addition to
Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any failure of Purchaser
to comply with the previous sentence shall be allocated to, and shall be
payable by, Purchaser; provided further, however, that Purchaser shall not be
liable for any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with
respect to any Tax Return that was required to be filed on or before the
Closing Date.

 



 

15.4 _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchase Price excludes, and Purchaser shall be
liable for the entire amount of any sales, use, excise, stock, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, registration, authorization, and similar
Taxes, fees, transfer fees, and charges incurred or required to be paid by any
of the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Parties in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. If
required by applicable law, Seller will charge and collect any applicable
sales tax unless Purchaser provides a valid exemption or direct pay
certificate.

 



 

15.5 _Income Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each Party shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay,
all Income Taxes incurred by or imposed on it, its direct or indirect owners
or Affiliates, or any combined, unitary, or consolidated group of which any of
the foregoing is or was a member, and no such Taxes shall be taken into
account as adjustments to the Purchase Price under _Section 3.2_ and/or
_Section 14.1_, as applicable.

 



 

15.6 _Form 8594_. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation of
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, pursuant to Temporary Treasury Regulation
section 1.1060-1T, to report the allocation of the Purchase Price among the
applicable Acquired Assets. To the extent required by Code section 1060 and
any Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, any such allocations shall be
consistent with the Purchase Price allocation as set forth in _Exhibit C_.
Except as required by Law, none of the Parties (or their applicable
Affiliates) shall take any position on its Tax returns that is inconsistent
with the allocation of the Purchase Price set forth on _Exhibit C_ (plus
other capitalized costs) as so agreed or as adjusted.

 



 

15.7 _Section 1031 Exchange Accommodation._

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to this
_Section 15.7_, either Party (in such capacity, the " ** _Exchanging Party_**
") may at any time prior to any Closing assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and take such other steps as required to satisfy
the requirements of one or more like-kind exchange pursuant to Code section
1031 with respect to such Exchanging Party (an " ** _Exchange Transaction_**
"). Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 15.7_, the other Party
(in such capacity, the " ** _Non-Exchanging Party_** ") shall, as and when
reasonably requested by the Exchanging Party from time to time, execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments, and take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions as the
Exchanging Party may determine is reasonably necessary or appropriate for
purposes of causing the Contemplated Transactions, in whole or in part, to
satisfy the requirements of Code section 1031 with respect to the Exchanging
Party.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Exchanging Party provides for
reimbursement or indemnity reasonably acceptable to the Non-Exchanging Party:
(i) the Non-Exchanging Party shall not be obligated to pay any additional
costs or incur any additional obligations or Liabilities in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions if such costs, obligations or Liabilities arise
out of or result from the Exchange Transaction (ii) the Non-Exchanging Party
shall not be obligated to take title to any other assets or property, or to
undertake any obligations to any third party, as a result of the Exchange
Transaction; and (iii) nothing herein shall be deemed the agreement of the
Non-Exchanging Party to delay any Closing of, or payment under, this
Agreement, in connection with the Exchange Transaction. The Non-Exchanging
Party shall provide no assurance to the Exchanging Party that any particular
tax treatment will be given to the Exchanging Party as a result of the
Exchange Transaction, and the Non-Exchanging Party shall have no obligation to
the Exchanging Party or any other Person if the Exchange Transaction fails to
qualify as a "like kind exchange" under Code section 1031 or similar state or
local tax provision.

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial assignment by
the Exchanging Party of rights under this Agreement or any of the Acquired
Assets to a qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder as
required by Code section 1031 and the administrative rules governing same (an
" ** _Intermediary_** ") shall not (i) release the Exchanging

 



      
 

 



 

Party from any of its Liabilities and obligations under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, or (ii) expand any Liabilities or obligations of
the Non-Exchanging Party under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document. The Exchanging Party and any such Intermediary, and their successors
and assigns, shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations and
Liabilities of the Exchanging Party under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Non-
Exchanging Party from and against all Claims, Losses and Liabilities, if any,
arising out of or resulting from an Exchange Transaction without regard to the
Indemnification Threshold, including any Claims, Losses and Liabilities (but
only to the extent such Claims, Losses and Liabilities would not have arisen
if the Contemplated Transactions had been conducted without the Exchange
Transaction) arising out of or resulting from the transfer, assignment or
conveyance of any Acquired Assets to an Intermediary instead of the Exchanging
Party.

 



 

(d) In order to minimize administrative burdens as well as third party
preferential purchase and consent rights, Seller and Purchaser may transfer
the Acquired Assets to a newly-formed, Delaware limited liability company
wholly owned by Seller (a " **Title LLC** "), and then may substitute the
assignment of such Acquired Assets by the assignment of all of the membership
interests in such Title LLC directly or through an Intermediary. Subject to
this _Section 15.7_, particularly _Section 15.7(b)_ and _Section 15.7(c)_,
the Seller and Purchaser agree to work in good faith to accommodate
utilization of a Title LLC in an Exchange Transaction if desired by either
party. Any assignment by an Exchanging Party to an Intermediary made in
violation of this _Section 15.7_ shall be void.

 



 

15.8 _Post-Closing Tax Matters_. After Closing, each of Purchaser and Seller
shall:

 



 

(a) reasonably cooperate and assist the other (i) in preparing any Tax Returns
relating to any Tax relating to the Acquired Assets, or the Transaction, and
(ii) in qualifying for any exemption or reduction in Tax that may be
available;

 



 

(b) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits, examinations or other
Tax proceedings by, or disputes with, taxing authorities regarding any Tax
relating to the Acquired Assets or the Transaction;

 



 

(c) make available to the other, and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested, any information, records, and documents relating to a Tax incurred
or imposed in connection with the Acquired Assets or the Transaction;

 



 

(d) provide notice within 10 days of receipt to the other in writing of any
pending or threatened Tax audit, examination, or assessment received in
writing that could reasonably be expected to affect the others Tax liability
under applicable Law or this Agreement (a " ** _Tax Controversy_** "), and to
promptly furnish the other with copies of all correspondence with respect to
any Tax Controversy; and

 



 

(e) allow the other to participate, at its own expense, in any Tax
Controversy, and not settle any Tax Controversy without the prior written
consent of the other, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

16.3 _Claim Notice_.

 



 

(a) _Contents_. If a Party in good faith believes that an Indemnified Seller
Party or an Indemnified Purchaser Party (an " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") is
or may be entitled to indemnification or a defense under _Section 16.2_, and
such Party desires to assert its right to indemnification or a defense, such
Party must deliver a written notice (a " ** _Claim Notice_** ") to the Party
that the Indemnified Party believes is obligated to provide such
indemnification or defense to the Indemnified Party (the " ** _Indemnifying
Party_** "). A Claim Notice shall include to the extent reasonably
practicable: (i) either (A) if known, the amount of the Loss or Claim, (B) if
not known but subject to reasonable estimation, a reasonable estimate of the
Loss or Claim, and (C) if not known and not subject to reasonable estimation,

inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(b) _Time for Delivery  Third-Party Claims_. In the case of a Claim or
Proceeding brought by any Person other than a Party that may result in a Loss
for which indemnification or a defense may be sought under _Section 16.2_ (a
" ** _Third-Party Claim_** "), a Claim Notice shall be delivered to the
Indemnifying Party: (i) within thirty (30) Business Days after the Indemnified
Party receives written notice or obtains knowledge of the Claim or Proceeding
and (ii) before the expiration of the applicable survival period under
_Section 16.1_, if the right to indemnification or a defense arises solely
under _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ of _Section 16.2(a)_ or _clause (i)_ or
_(ii)_ of _Section 16.2(b)_, as applicable, in connection with the breach by
an Indemnifying Party of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement _;
provided, however_ , that in the event of a delay in giving a notice of a
Third-Party Claim within the time required under clause (i) of this _Section
16.3(b)_, the Indemnifying Party shall be not be relieved of its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect thereto unless and only to
the extent the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such delay.

 



 

(c) _Time for Delivery  Other Claims_. In the case of any Loss other than a
Third-Party Claim for which indemnification may be sought under _Section
16.2_, to be effective, a Claim Notice must be delivered to the Indemnifying
Party: (i) promptly (but in any event within thirty (30) Business Days) after
the Indemnified Party has knowledge or notice of the Loss or the event,
circumstance, act, or omission giving rise to the right to indemnification;
and (ii) before the expiration of the applicable survival period under
_Section 16.1_, if the right to indemnification or a defense arises solely
under _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ of _Section 16.2(a)_ or _clause (i)_ or
_(ii)_ of _Section 16.2(b)_, as applicable, in connection with the breach by
an Indemnifying Party of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement;
_provided, however_ , that a delay in giving a notice within the time required
under _clause (i)_ of this _Section 16.3(c)_ (but not _clause (ii)_ of this
_Section 16.3(c)_) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under _Section 16.2_, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such delay.

 



 

16.4 _Third-Party Claims_. With respect to a Third-Party Claim:

 



 

(a) _Defense by Indemnifying Party_. If an Indemnified Party asserts it is
entitled to indemnification or a defense in connection with a Third-Party
Claim, at the election of the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party made by written notice to the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party
to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim, including the
determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of any related Proceedings
through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice; _provided, however_ ,
the Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30)
Business Day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If
an Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of such defense:

 



 

(i) The Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have admitted its obligation to
indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party
Claim and may not later contest such obligation; _provided, however_ , such
admission shall in no event be deemed to waive any limitations as to the
liability of, or expand any obligations of such Indemnifying Party;

 



 

(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall conduct such defense in a diligent manner at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party;

 



 

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all
documents and materials in the possession or control of the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third-Party Claim and provide such other information and
assistance that the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably deem necessary to the
proper defense of the Third-Party Claim;

 



 

(iv) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all
privileged documents and materials in the possession or control of the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim pursuant to the terms of a
joint defense agreement or common interest agreement mutually agreed in good
faith by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, unless counsel for
the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that providing such information
and entering into such joint defense agreement or common interest agreement
would compromise conflicting Claims of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party;

 



 

(v) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, and provide copies of any materials disclosed to the claimant or
plaintiff in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; and

 



 

(vi) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle, adjust, or
compromise such Third-Party Claim: (A) with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; or (B) without the consent of the Indemnified Party, provided
that such settlement, adjustment, or compromise includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party and the other Indemnified Seller Parties or
Indemnified Purchaser Parties, as applicable; imposes no relief other than
monetary damages; and there is no finding of violation of Law or violation of
the rights of any Person.

 



 

(b) _Defense By Indemnified Party_. If an Indemnified Party asserts it is
entitled to a defense of the Third-Party Claim under _Section 16.2_, and the
Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume control of the defense,
then:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) if it is finally determined in a non-appealable final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnifying Party was obligated to provide
such defense, all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party to
defend the Third-Party Claim shall be for the account of the Indemnifying
Party;

 



 

(ii) whether or not the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide such
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Indemnified Party
all non-privileged documents and materials in the possession or control of the
Indemnifying Party relating to the Third-Party Claim and provide such other
information and assistance that the Indemnified Party shall reasonably deem
necessary to the proper defense of the Third-Party Claim;

 



 

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, and provide copies of any materials disclosed to the claimant or
plaintiff in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; and

 



 

(iv) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, adjust, or
compromise such Third-Party Claim with the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. If a Third-Party Claim requires immediate action, both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in good faith to
take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of such Third-
Party Claim or any Partys position with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

16.5 _Limitations on Losses_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Agreement:

 



 

(a) the aggregate Liability of Seller under the terms of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents shall be limited to ten (10%) of the Base
Purchase Price; _provided, however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, as used in
this _Section 16.5(a)_, the term "Base Purchase Price" shall (A) from the
First Closing until the Second Closing be deemed to refer to only the First
Closing Base Purchase Price and (B) from and after the Second Closing be
deemed to refer to an amount equal to the sum of the First Closing Base
Purchase Price _plus_ the Second Closing Base Purchase Price;

 



 

(b) Seller shall have no Liability under _Section 16.2(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ for
indemnification for an individual matter until such time as the aggregate
amount of all finally determined or mutually agreed upon Losses suffered or
incurred by the Indemnified Purchaser Parties subject to indemnification under
_Section 16.2(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ with respect to such matter exceeds the
Indemnification Threshold;

 



 

(c) without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall have no Liability under
_Section 16.2(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ for indemnification until and unless the
aggregate amount of the Liability for all Losses which exceed the
Indemnification Threshold exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Base
Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds one
and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Base Purchase Price;

 



 

(d) the Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this
_Article 16_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) each Indemnified Party shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate or
minimize all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and Claims that
are indemnifiable hereunder and if an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate
any indemnifiable Losses and Claims under the preceding sentence, the Party
that would otherwise have an indemnity obligation hereunder with respect to
such Losses and Claims shall have no liability for any portion of such Losses
and Claims that reasonably could have been avoided or mitigated had the
Indemnified Party made such efforts;

 



 

(f) no Affiliate of Seller or any Indemnified Seller Parties and their
respective directors, managers, partners, members, stockholders, officers,
employees, attorneys, contractors and agents shall have any liability to any
Indemnified Purchaser Party hereunder or under any other agreement delivered
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Seller Party in connection with the
Contemplated Transaction;

 



 

(g) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO:
(i) THE INDEMNIFIED PARTYS SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY, OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT; OR
(ii) WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED ON PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE ACTS, CLAIMS,
OR LAWS (INCLUDING ANY PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE BULK SALES LAW, ENVIRONMENTAL
LAW, FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAW, SECURITIES LAW, OR OTHER LAW); AND

 



 

(h) CONSISTENT WITH _SECTION 17.12_, NO PARTY OR INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL
HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR INDEMNIFICATION, CLAIMS, LOSSES, OR OTHERWISE UNDER ANY
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND "LOSSES" AND "CLAIMS" SHALL NOT INCLUDE, (i)
ANY COST, EXPENSE, DAMAGE, LOSS, OR LIABILITY IN THE NATURE OF INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE (EVEN IF THE INDEMNIFYING OR
BREACHING PARTY IS AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING), EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING RELATE TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS SUFFERED BY
ANY THIRD PARTY FOR WHICH RESPONSIBILITY IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE PARTIES,
WHICH SHALL BE INCLUDED IN LOSSES AND CLAIMS OR (ii) ANY DIMINUTION OF VALUE
OR INCREASE IN LIABILITY, LOSS, CLAIMS, COST, EXPENSE, AWARD OR JUDGMENT TO
THE EXTENT SUCH INCREASE IS CAUSED BY THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY PERSON
ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

 



 

16.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) _Exclusive Remedy_. If the First Closing occurs, the right of Purchaser to
indemnification under _Section 16.2_, _Sections 12.2_ and _Section 12.3_,
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser against any Indemnified
Seller Party for, subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 16.1_ ,
_16.3_ , and _Section 16.5_: (i) any breach by Seller of any of its
respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; (ii) all Claims and Losses of
Purchaser arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents or the Contemplated Transactions; and
(iii) all other Claims and Losses arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, **IN EACH
CASE, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN**

 



      
 

 



 

 **PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
PERSON**. No Party or Person is asserting the accuracy, completeness, or truth
of any representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather the
Parties have agreed that should any representation or warranty of any party
prove inaccurate, incomplete or untrue, the other party shall have the
specific rights and remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy
therefor, but that no other rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in
Law or in equity or whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) are permitted
to any party hereto as a result of the failure, breach, inaccuracy,
incompleteness or untruth of any such representation and warranty.

 



 

(b) _Waiver_. If the First Closing occurs, except for the right of Purchaser
to indemnification under _Section 16.2_, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any right to contribution
against any Indemnified Seller Party (including any contribution under CERCLA
or any other Environmental Law) and any and all other Claims and rights it may
have against or from any Indemnified Seller Party arising under or based on
any Law or other legal theory (whether in contract, tort, equity, or
otherwise).

 



 

16.7 _Waiver of Right to Rescission_. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that
the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be
adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
hereby waives and relinquishes any right to rescind this Agreement, the
purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets, and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

16.8 _Releases_. Except for the remedies expressly contained in _Section
16.2(a)_ for which Seller has agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Purchaser
Parties under this Agreement or Sellers special warranty of title set forth
in the Assignment, at each applicable Closing Purchaser, on its own behalf and
on behalf of the other Indemnified Purchaser Parties, shall be deemed to have
waived and released the Indemnified Seller Parties from, and Purchaser shall
assume, any and all Claims and Losses the Purchaser or the Indemnified
Purchaser Parties might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or Sellers ownership, use or operation of the
applicable Acquired Assets that are the subject of such Closing, or the
condition, quality, status or nature of the Acquired Assets that are the
subject of such Closing, including rights to contribution under any
Environmental Laws, breaches of statutory and implied warranties, nuisance or
other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common law rights of
contribution, any rights under insurance policies issued or underwritten by
the other Party or any Affiliate of such Party and any rights under agreements
between Seller and any Indemnified Seller Party, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN
PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON, INVITEES OR THIRD PARTIES, but excluding, however, any
remaining balance owed by Seller to any other Affiliate of Seller at the end
of the applicable Closing Date for provision of goods or services, or
employment related costs, or other ordinary course of business expenses, with
respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets that are the subject of
such Closing.

 



 

16.9 _Subrogation_. To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this
Agreement, Purchaser and Seller hereby waive for themselves and their
respective successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to
subrogation for Losses for which such Party is liable or against which such
Party indemnifies any other Person under this Agreement. If required by
applicable insurance policies, each Party shall obtain a waiver of such
subrogation from its insurers.

 



      
 

 



 

16.10 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Seller or Purchaser may have against
any Person that is not a party to this Agreement for any obligations or
Liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

16.11 _Express Negligence/Conspicuous Manner_ **. WITH RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT, BOTH PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS _ARTICLE
16_ COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT, KNOWN AS THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE, TO
EXPRESSLY STATE IN A CONSPICUOUS MANNER TO AFFORD FAIR AND ADEQUATE NOTICE
THAT THIS AGREEMENT HAS PROVISIONS REQUIRING THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH OF SELLER AND PURCHASER UNDERSTAND THAT PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IS SOMETIMES AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY AND SOMETIMES AN
INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH INDEMNIFYING PARTY REPRESENTS TO THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY
(1) THAT IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY HAS CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY CONCERNING THIS
AGREEMENT OR, IF IT HAS NOT CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY, THAT IT WAS PROVIDED THE
OPPORTUNITY AND HAD THE ABILITY TO SO CONSULT, BUT MADE AN INFORMED DECISION
NOT TO DO SO, AND (2) THAT IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY FULLY UNDERSTANDS ITS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.**

17.1 _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _Attorney s Fees_. In any court Proceeding brought under this Agreement,
notwithstanding any contrary rule of Law, the court, in its discretion may
award the prevailing Party in the Proceeding the reasonable costs and
attorneys fees in prosecuting or defending the Claim that is the subject of
the Proceeding.

 



 

(b) _Other Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, all fees, costs, and expenses incurred by a Party in negotiating or

advisory, and accounting fees, costs, and expenses.

 



 

17.2 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
14.1_, _Section 5.9_ and _Section 6.8_, any Proceeding arising under or

inconvenient forum. If such courts refuse to exercise jurisdiction hereunder,
the Parties agree that such jurisdiction shall be proper in any court in which
jurisdiction may be obtained. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of
process by delivery of the copy of the process pursuant to the notice

jurisdiction other than the State of Texas; _provided, however_ , in
connection with the determination of the existence of any Environmental Defect

contained in this Agreement shall be severable. If any provision of this
Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application of any such provision
(or any portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of
the remaining provisions of this Agreement or the validity, legality, or
enforceability of the offending provision as to any other Person or
circumstance or in any other jurisdiction. The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction or with respect to any
event or circumstance shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction or with respect to any other event or
circumstance, nor shall the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement with respect to any Person affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision with respect to any other Person.

and on behalf of any successor or assignee, that, if the DTPA is applicable to
this Agreement, (a) AFTER CONSULTATION WITH ATTORNEYS OF PURCHASERS OWN
SELECTION, PURCHASER HEREBY VOLUNTARILY WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL OF PURCHASERS
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE DTPA AS APPLICABLE TO SELLER AND SELLERS
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS AND (b) PURCHASER SHALL DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY THE
INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OF OR BY ANY OF
THE INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS BASED
IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE DTPA ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT.
