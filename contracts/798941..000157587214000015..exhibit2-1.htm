   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

   

   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 10, 2014 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between First Citizens Bancorporation, Inc., a South
Carolina corporation (" _South_ "), and First Citizens BancShares, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _North_ ").

   

   WITNESSETH:

   

   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of South, upon the recommendation of a
special committee consisting of certain independent members of the Board of
Directors of South (the " _South Special Committee "_), and the Board of
Directors of North, upon the recommendation of an evaluation committee
consisting of certain independent members of the Board of Directors of North
(the " _North Evaluation Committee "_), have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate
the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement,
pursuant to which South will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, merge with and into North (the " _Merger_ "), with North as
the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity
as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger;

   

   WHEREAS, the parties intend the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and intend for this Agreement to constitute a "plan
of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

   

   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

   

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

   

   ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

   

   1.1 _The Merger. _Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the South Carolina Business Corporation Act of 1988, as
amended (the " _SCBCA_ "), and the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, South shall merge with and
into North. North shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of South shall
terminate.

   

   1.2 _Effective Time. _The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the articles of merger to be filed with the South Carolina Secretary of State
(the " _South Carolina Secretary_ ") and the certificate of merger to be filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "),
respectively, on the Closing Date, each of which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to North and South (collectively, the "
_Articles of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of
Merger.

   

   

   

   

   1.3 _Effects of the Merger._ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the SCBCA and
the DGCL.

   

   1.4 _Conversion of South Common Stock. _At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of North, South or the holder
of any of the following securities:

   

   (a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of South common stock, $5.00
par value per share (the " _South Voting Stock_ ") and South nonvoting common
stock, $5.00 par value per share (the " _South Nonvoting Stock_ " and
collectively with the South Voting Stock, the " _South Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for (i) shares
of South Common Stock owned by South as treasury stock or owned, directly or
indirectly, by South or North or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (excluding (A) any such shares held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity on behalf of third parties or (B) shares held, directly or
indirectly, in respect of a debt previously contracted (the shares referred to
in clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B), the " _Third Party Shares_ ")), and (ii) any
shares of South Common Stock the holder of which (A) has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (B) has demanded its rights to be
paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the SCBCA
and (C) has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to be paid the fair
value of such shares of South Common Stock (such shares, " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall be converted into the right to receive 4.00 shares of North Class A
Common Stock and $50.00, unless a holder elects (the " _Class B Election_ ")
in the holder's letter of transmittal for each share of such holder's South
Common Stock to be converted into (x) 3.58 shares of North Class A Common
Stock and (y) 0.42 shares of North Class B Common Stock (for clarity, South
and North agree that no cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares)
shall be payable with respect to shares of South Common Stock for which the
holder thereof made a Class B Election). The cash payable, and the shares of
North Common Stock issuable, upon conversion of the South Common Stock,
together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to this
Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e), are referred to as the " _Merger
Consideration_ ".

   

   

        2     
  
  
    

   

   (b) All of the shares of South Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a " _South Share
Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to " _South
Share Certificate_ " shall be deemed, as appropriate, to include reference to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of South
Common Stock, and it being further understood that provisions herein relating
to South Share Certificates shall be interpreted in a manner that
appropriately accounts for book-entry shares, including that, in lieu of
delivery of a South Share Certificate and a letter of transmittal as specified
herein, shares held in book-entry form may be transferred by means of an
"agent's message" to the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) previously representing any such
shares of South Common Stock shall thereafter represent, subject to Section
2.2(b), only the right to receive a certificate or certificates representing
the number of whole shares of North Common Stock which such shares of South
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.4(a) and cash (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) which the
shares of South Common Stock represented by such South Share Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and
Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon. South Share Certificates
previously representing shares of South Common Stock shall, subject to Section
2.2(b), be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of North
Common Stock upon the surrender of such South Share Certificates in accordance
with Section 2.1, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of North Common Stock or South Common Stock shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend or stock distribution,
stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration (it being
understood that any dividend or distribution permitted under Section
5.2(b)(ii) or 5.3(a) shall not be deemed to constitute an extraordinary
dividend or distribution and shall not result in any adjustment to the Merger
Consideration hereunder).

   

   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of South Common Stock that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by South or North or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (excluding any Third Party Shares) and all Dissenting Shares
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of North or, except
to the extent required by Chapter 13 of the SCBCA in the case of Dissenting
Shares, other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

   

   1.5 _North Common Stock. _At and after the Effective Time, each share of
North Class A Common Stock and North Class B Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of North Class A Common Stock and North Class B Common
Stock, as applicable, of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

   

   1.6 _Dissenting Shares._

   

   (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration. By virtue of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be

otherwise) the right to dissent or its dissenters' rights, then, as of the

        3     
  
  
    

   

   (c) South shall give North (i) prompt written notice of any notice
received by South of any stockholder's intent to demand the fair value of any
shares of South Common Stock, any demand received by South for payment of the
fair value of any shares of South Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to Chapter 13 of the SCBCA and

        5     
  
  
    

   

   2.2 _Exchange of Shares._

   

   (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in
any event within ten business days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of one or more South Share Certificates representing
shares of South Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have
been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article I, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the South Share Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the South Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
such South Share Certificates) to the Exchange Agent), that, among other
things, permits each holder to make the Class B Election, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the South Share
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration that the shares of South
Common Stock represented by such South Share Certificate or South Share
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a South Share
Certificate or South Share Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed, duly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder of such South Share Certificate or South Share
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(A) a North Share Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
North Class A Common Stock to which such holder of South Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, (B) a North
Share Certificate representing that number of whole shares of North Class B
Common Stock to which such holder of South Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, if such holder makes a Class
B Election and (C) a check representing the amount of cash (including cash in
lieu of fractional shares) which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the South Share Certificate or South Share Certificates surrendered
pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and the provisions of this Article II and any
dividends or distributions that are then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b),
and the South Share Certificate or South Share Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash
paid or payable in respect of the Merger Consideration. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, except as set forth in Section 1.6, each
South Share Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable under Section 2.2(b).
For purposes of this Agreement, " _business day_ " means a day, other than
Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks in Raleigh, North
Carolina are authorized or required by Law to close.

   

   (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to North
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered South Share
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such South Share
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a South
Share Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive (i) any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, with a record date after the
Effective Time and previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender
with respect to the whole shares of North Common Stock which the shares of
South Common Stock represented by such South Share Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive (which amounts shall be paid at the time
the Merger Consideration is paid in respect of such South Share Certificate)
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time (but prior to such
surrender date) which thereafter become payable with respect to the whole
shares of North Common Stock which the shares of South Common Stock
represented by such South Share Certificate have been converted into the right
to receive.

   

   

        6     
  
  
    

   

   (c) If any North Share Certificate representing shares of North Common
Stock is to be issued in, or cash is to be paid to, a name other than that in
which the South Share Certificate or South Share Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the South Share Certificate or South Share Certificates
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a North
Share Certificate representing shares of North Common Stock or the payment of
cash in respect of the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of
fractional shares) in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
South Share Certificate or South Share Certificates surrendered or shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

   

   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of South of the shares of South Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than to settle
transfers of such South Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, South Share Certificates representing
shares of South Common Stock are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Article II.

   

   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no North
Share Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of North Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of South Share
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to North Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of North. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, North shall pay to each former stockholder of South who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the North Closing
Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of
South Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to
the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of North Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4. " _North Closing Price_ " means the average, rounded to the nearest one
ten thousandth, of daily closing sales prices for the North Class A Common
Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") during the 20-day
trading period ending on (and including) the last complete trading day prior
to the Effective Time, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_.

   

   (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of South for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation, and any former stockholders of South who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the North Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each former share of South Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of North, South, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of South Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws.

   

   

        7     
  
  
    

   

   (g) North shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of South Common Stock such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by North or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of South Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by North or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

   

   (h) In the event any South Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such South Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by North, the posting by such person of a bond in such
form and amount as North or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such South Share Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed South Share Certificate the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable under Section 2.2(b)
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

   ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SOUTH

   

   Except as Previously Disclosed by South, South hereby represents and
warrants to North as follows:

   

   3.1 _Corporate Organization._

   

   (a) South is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of South Carolina and is a financial
holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). South has the corporate power and authority to
own or lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and to perform its obligations under all
Contracts by which it is bound. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Contract_ " means, any written, oral or other agreement, plan, contract,
subcontract, lease, understanding, instrument, note, bond, loan, option,
warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan,
or commitment or undertaking of any nature. South is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect
to South or North, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Material Adverse Effect
shall not include any material adverse effect on the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of a party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole that results from
or arises out of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in Laws of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war, hostilities or acts of
terrorism or natural disasters) or in economic or market conditions (including
changes in prevailing interest rates, credit availability and liquidity,
currency exchange rates and price levels or trading volumes in the United
States or foreign securities markets) affecting the financial services
industry generally, (D) changes after the date hereof in the banking industry,
credit markets, any downgrades in the credit markets or adverse credit events
resulting in deterioration in the credit markets generally and including
changes to any previously correctly-applied asset marks resulting therefrom,
(E) a decline in the trading price of a party's common stock or the failure,
in and of itself, to meet earnings projections, but not, in either case,
including the underlying causes thereof, (F) the public disclosure of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (G) any goodwill
impairment charges incurred on the books of South through the Effective Time
solely as a result of the execution of this Agreement, or (H) actions or
omissions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party; except, with respect to clauses (A),
(B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate. As used in this
Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ ", when used with respect to any person,
means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
entity or organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which stock
or other equity interests having ordinary voting power to elect more than 50%
of the board of directors or other governing body are owned, directly or
indirectly, by such person. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of South, as amended through the date hereof (the " _South
Charter_ ") and the Bylaws of South, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been delivered by South to North.

   

   

        9     
  
  
    

   

   

 

 

   

   

   (b) Each Subsidiary of South (a " _South Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law, in good standing (to the extent such concept
is applicable) in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South and (iii)
has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of South to pay dividends or
distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of South that
is an insured depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments required to
be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings
for the termination of such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of
South, threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the South Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of South as of the date hereof
and any material joint ventures, partnerships formed pursuant to written
partnership agreements or similar arrangements in which South or its
Subsidiaries has a limited liability, partnership or other equity interest

results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders' equity or
financial position are consolidated in the financial statements of South other
than the South Subsidiaries.

bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on
any matters on which stockholders of South may vote. Since December 31, 2013
through the date hereof, South has not issued or repurchased any shares of its
capital stock. No South Subsidiary owns any capital stock of South other than
any Third Party Shares.

   

   

        10     
  
  
    

   

   (b) There is no Contract by which either South or its Subsidiaries are
bound pursuant to which (i) South or its Subsidiaries is or could be required

South is not currently deferring interest payments with respect to any trust
preferred securities or related junior subordinated debt securities issued by
it or any of its affiliates.

   

   (c) Except for the Trust Preferred Securities, South owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity ownership interests of each of the South Subsidiaries, free and clear
of any liens, pledges, charges, mortgages, claims, options, rights of first
refusal, preemptive rights, community property interests, encumbrances and
security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, rights of participation or

attaching to the ownership thereof. No South Subsidiary has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
Contracts of any character that require the purchase or issuance of any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

   3.5 _Reports_.

   

   (a) South and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all material

registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the Laws of the
United States, any state, any foreign entity or any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on South. Except for normal examinations conducted by
a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of the business of South and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of South, investigation into the business or operations
of South or any of its Subsidiaries, except where such proceedings or

unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any South Report relating to any examinations or inspections of
South or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) has been no unresolved formal or
informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory
Agency with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of
South or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (i)

in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South.

   

   (b) Each South Report complied in all material respects with all statutes
applicable thereto, and to all rules and regulations enforced or promulgated
by the Regulatory Agencies with which it was filed, and, at the time it was
filed (or if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of that subsequent filing) did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. South
has, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provided to North copies of
all comment letters received by it or its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory
Agency since January 1, 2010, regarding any South Report, together with
South's or any South Subsidiary's responses to such comment letters. Except as
described in those comment letters, neither South nor any of the South
Subsidiaries has been notified by any Regulatory Agency that any such South
Report was deficient in any material respect as to form or content.

the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and statements of income for the quarter ended
March 31, 2014 (such balance sheets and the related statements of income,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows are collectively referred to
herein as the " _South Financial Statements_ "). The South Financial
Statements (including the related notes) (i) complied as to form, as of their
respective dates, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as may be indicated
in such statements or in the notes thereto, (iii) are based on the books and
records of South and its Subsidiaries, (iv) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial condition of South and its Subsidiaries
at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
notes and normal year-end adjustments that were not, individually or in the
aggregate, material in amount or effect.) The South Financial Statements do
not contain any material items of extraordinary or nonrecurring income or any
other material income not earned in the ordinary course of business, except as
expressly specified therein.

   

   (b) South has furnished North with true and complete copies of the
Reports of Condition and Income as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and

Reports fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of
South Bank and the results of its operations at the date and for the period
indicated in the Bank Call Report in conformity with the instructions to the
Bank Call Report. The Bank Call Reports do not contain any material items of
special or nonrecurring income or any other material income not earned in the
ordinary course of business except as expressly specified therein. South Bank
has calculated its allowance for loan losses in accordance with regulatory
accounting principles, including the Instructions for Preparation of
Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income and the Interagency Policy
Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses as applied to banking
institutions and in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations. The
allowance for Loan losses account for South Bank is, and as of the Closing
Date will be, adequate in all material respects to provide for all losses
incurred, net of recoveries relating to Loans previously charged off, on all
outstanding Loans of South Bank; _provided, however_ , that no representation
or warranty is made as to the sufficiency of collateral securing, or the
collectability of, such loans.

   

   (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South, neither
South nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities or obligations of any
nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, known, unknown or
otherwise, whether due or to become due and whether or not required to be
reflected in South's financial statements in accordance with GAAP) except for
(i) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved for in the
consolidated financial statements of South included in the South Financial
Statements for December 31, 2013, (ii) liabilities incurred since December 31,
2013 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and
(iii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of South or its Subsidiaries (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls
of South. The books of account and other financial records of South and its
Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to North, (i) are complete
and correct in all material respects; (ii) represent actual, bona fide
transactions; (iii) have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices; and (iv) reflect the basis for the financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity of South as set
forth in the South Financial Statements. South and its Subsidiaries have
implemented and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that (A) transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, (B)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (C)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization, and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action
is taken with respect to any difference.

   

   (e) Since January 1, 2011, neither South nor any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of South, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or Representative of South or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or has otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including, with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of South

including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that South or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

or incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees
in connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. On or prior to the date hereof, South has disclosed to North the

   (d) With respect to each South Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _South Qualified Plans_ ")
and the related trust, the IRS has issued a favorable opinion, advisory, or
determination letter, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation
been threatened), and, to the knowledge of South, there are no existing

a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. No trust funding any South
Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.

   

   (g) Other than for the routine provision of benefits under the South
Benefit Plans, meeting statutory funding requirements, and for PBGC premiums,
neither South nor any South ERISA Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects
to incur, either directly or indirectly, any material liability under Title I

years prior to the date hereof, been the subject of an examination or audit by
the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity or
is the subject of an application or filing under, or is a participant in, an
amnesty, voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar program sponsored by
any Governmental Entity.

   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the South Disclosure
Schedule, neither South nor any of its Subsidiaries' sponsors has sponsored or
has any material obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that
provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life
insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees, directors or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code or other applicable Laws.

required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of South. All benefits accrued under any
unfunded South Benefit Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise adequately
reserved to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

   

   (j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South, there
are no pending or, to the knowledge of South, threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which
have been asserted or instituted, and, to South's knowledge, no such claim or
lawsuit is threatened against the South Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the South Benefit Plans or the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the South Benefit Plans which could reasonably be
expected to result in any liability of South or any of its Subsidiaries to the
PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a South Benefit Plan or any other party.

   

   (k) Neither South nor any South ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA) which could subject South or any of its ERISA Affiliates or any
person that South or any of its ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to
indemnify in respect thereof to any material Tax or penalty imposed under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

   

   

        20     
  
  
    

   

   (l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
South or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of
South or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any South Benefit Plan or related trust. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether
in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) by South or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code. Neither South nor any of its Subsidiaries
maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or require South or
any of its affiliates to establish or make any contribution to a rabbi trust
or similar funding vehicle. No South Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

   

   3.12 _Labor Matters_. Neither South nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement with any of its
employees, any labor union or any other collective bargaining unit or
organization. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of South, threatened
material labor dispute, work stoppage or strike involving South or any South

   3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

   

   (a) South and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times, held,
all licenses, registrations, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their
respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to applicable Law
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), except where the failure to hold any such licenses, registrations,
franchises, permits or authorizations or the failure to pay any such fees or
assessments would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South, and, to the knowledge of
South, no suspension or cancellation of any such material license,
registration, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened in writing.
South and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in default
or violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation,
judgment, injunction, decree, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity
(each, a " _Law_ ") relating to South or any of its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation all applicable Laws related to data protection or privacy,
the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
and Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, any regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, the Interagency Policy Statement on Retail Sales of
Nondeposit Investment Products, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the

Act_ ") and all agency requirements relating to the origination, sale and
servicing of mortgage and consumer Loans, except for such failures to comply,
defaults or violations that would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South. There is
no, and since January 1, 2012, there has been no, action, demand or
investigation by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the
knowledge of South, threatened alleging that South or any of its Subsidiaries
is not in compliance with any applicable Law, except for any action, demand or
investigation that would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South.

   

   

        21     
  
  
    

   

   (b) Without limitation, except as is reasonably likely to be material to
South and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, none of South or its
Subsidiaries or, to South's knowledge, any director, officer, employee, agent
or other person acting on behalf of South or any of its Subsidiaries has,
directly or indirectly, (i) used any funds of South or any of its Subsidiaries
for unlawful contributions, unlawful gifts, unlawful entertainment or other
unlawful expenses relating to political activity; (ii) made any unlawful
payment to foreign or domestic governmental officials or employees or to
foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns from funds of South or any

Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any similar Law; (iv) established or
maintained any unlawful fund of monies or other assets of South or any of its

or any of its Subsidiaries; (vi) made any unlawful bribe, unlawful rebate,

in money, property or services, to obtain favorable treatment in securing
business to obtain special concessions for South or any of its Subsidiaries,
to pay for favorable treatment for business secured or to pay for special
concessions already obtained for South or any of its Subsidiaries; or (vii) is
currently the subject of any United States sanctions administered by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department.

   

   (c) South and each of its Subsidiaries has properly administered all
accounts for which South or any of its Subsidiaries acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which South or any of its Subsidiaries serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of the applicable governing
documents and applicable Laws, except where the failure to so administer such
accounts would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South. None of South or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to South's knowledge, any director, officer or employee of
South or its Subsidiaries has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty
with respect to any such fiduciary account, and the accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South.

   

   (d) South and South Bank are "well-capitalized" and "well managed" (as
those terms are defined in applicable regulations), and South Bank's rating
under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is no less than "satisfactory."

or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North. True and
complete copies of the North Charter and Bylaws of North, in each case as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
by North to South.

   

   

        35

recognized under applicable Law, in good standing (to the extent such concept
is applicable) in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North and (iii)

Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending
or, to the knowledge of North, threatened. Section 4.1(b) of the North

not material in amount or effect). The North Financial Statements do not
contain any material items of extraordinary or nonrecurring income or any
other material income not earned in the ordinary course of business except as
expressly specified therein.

   

   (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North, neither
North nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities or obligations of any
nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, known, unknown or
otherwise, whether due or to become due and whether or not required to be
reflected in North's financial statements in accordance with GAAP) except for
(i) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved for on the
consolidated balance sheet of North and its Subsidiaries included in its

(including any notes thereto) and/or in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for

March 31, 2014 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

   (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of North and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of North or its Subsidiaries (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls
of North.

   

   (d) Since January 1, 2011, neither North nor any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of North, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or Representative of North or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or has otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of North
or any of its Subsidiaries or their internal control over financial reporting,
including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that North or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

   

   4.7 _Broker 's Fees. _With the exception of the engagement of Sandler
O'Neill + Partners, L.P., neither North nor any North Subsidiary nor any of
their respective Representatives on behalf of North or any of its Subsidiaries
have employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any
liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection
with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this Agreement. On or
prior to the date hereof, North has disclosed to South the aggregate fees
provided for in connection with the engagement of Sandler O'Neill + Partners,
L.P., relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereunder.

   

   4.8 _Absence of Changes._ Except as permitted in this Agreement, since
March 31, 2014, (a) no event or events have occurred that have had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on North, and (b) North and its Subsidiaries have
carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice.

   

   4.9 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
North, neither North nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any and there
are no pending or, to North's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of a material nature against North or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to the knowledge of North, any of their current or former directors or
executive officers. There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree
or regulatory restriction (other than regulatory restrictions of general
application that apply to similarly situated companies) imposed upon North,
any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of North or any of its Subsidiaries (or
that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to North, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its affiliates).

   

   

        40

be filed, taking into account any extensions, all Tax Returns required to have
been filed by it and such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and (b)
has fully and timely paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it that are
due (including any Taxes required to be withheld from amounts owing to any

appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP in the North Financial Statements.

has performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under
each loss share agreement between North or any North Subsidiary and the FDIC
for loss sharing (each a "North Loss Share Agreement"), except where such
noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North. To North's knowledge no
third-party counterparty to any North Loss Share Agreement is in material
breach or material violation of any provision of any North Loss Share
Agreement. No event or condition exists which constitutes or, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute a material default on the
part of North or any of its Subsidiaries under any such North Loss Share
Agreement, except where such default would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North.
Neither North nor any North Subsidiary has received any written notice of
cancellation or termination in connection with any North Loss Share Agreement.

   

   4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. North and each of its Subsidiaries
have complied with and are not in default or violation under any applicable
Law relating to North or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such failures to
comply, defaults or violations that would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on South.
There is no, and since January 1, 2012, there has been no, action, demand or
investigation by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the
knowledge of North, threatened alleging that North or any of its Subsidiaries
is not in compliance with any applicable Law, except for any action, demand or
investigation that would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North.

   

   4.13 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither North nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written Contract, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or a recipient of any
supervisory letter from, or has adopted any policies, procedures or board
resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity, in any such case, that currently restricts in any
material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or
risk management policies, its management or its business, nor has North or any
of its Subsidiaries been advised by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any such agreement.

   

   

        41     
  
  
    

   

   4.14 _Reorganization_. North has not taken any action and is not aware of
any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

   

   4.15 _SEC Reports. _North has previously made available (it being
understood that documents available via the SEC's EDGAR system shall be deemed
to have been made available for purposes of this representation) to South an
accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2011, by North pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the " _North SEC Reports_ ") and (b)
communication mailed by North to its stockholders since January 1, 2011 and
prior to the date hereof, and no such North Report or communication, as of the
date thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2011, as
of their respective dates, all North SEC Reports filed under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, no executive officer of North has failed in any respect to make the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of
the North SEC Reports.

   

   4.16 _North Information. _The information relating to North and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by North or its Representatives for inclusion in
the Joint Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any other document filed with any
other Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading, including at the time: (a) such document is filed with
the Regulatory Agency, (b) such document is amended or supplemented, (c) such
document is mailed to the stockholders of North or (d) of the North Meeting.
The portions of the Joint Proxy Statement relating to North and its
Subsidiaries will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The S-4 will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, no representation or
warranty is made by North with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference in the S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement based on information supplied by
or on behalf of South or any of its Representatives specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

   

   4.17 _Obstacles to Regulatory Approval._ To the knowledge of North, there
exists no fact or condition pertaining to North or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses or operations that may reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially impede or materially delay South and North from obtaining all
approvals of Regulatory Agencies required in order to consummate the
transactions described in this Agreement.

   

   

        42     
  
  
    

   

   4.18 _Opinion. _Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of North and the North Evaluation Committee have received an opinion
from Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. to the effect that, as of the date
thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of South Common Stock in the
Merger is fair to North and its stockholders from a financial point of view.
Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this
Agreement.

   

   4.19 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

   

   (a) Except for the representations and warranties made by North in this
Article IV, neither North nor any other person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to North, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and North hereby disclaims any such other

disclaimer, neither North nor any other person makes or has made any

Representatives with respect to (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to North, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or (ii) except for the
representations and warranties made by North in this Article IV, any oral or
written information presented to South or any of its affiliates or
Representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of North,
the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

   

   (b) North acknowledges and agrees that neither South nor any other person
has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to South other than those contained in Article III.

Financial Officer believe, in good faith, would not be permissible under GAAP,
applicable banking regulations, or other applicable Law, (ii) until
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iii) only following receipt of
written confirmation from North that it is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that would prevent completion of the Merger.

   

   

        48     
  
  
    

   

   5.5 _Loan Loss Reserve, Loan Repurchase Reserve and Loan Charge-Offs_.
Following the date of this Agreement, and prior to the Closing Date, South and
its Subsidiaries will make such appropriate accounting entries in their books
and records and take such other actions as are necessary or appropriate to:

   

   (a) charge-off any Loans on the books of South or its Subsidiaries, or
any portions thereof, that it, or North in its sole discretion, consider to be
losses, or that it, or North, otherwise believe, in good faith, are required
to be charged off pursuant to applicable banking regulations, GAAP or other
applicable Law, or that otherwise would be charged off by North after the
Effective Time in accordance with its loan administration and charge-off
policies and procedures; provided, however, that South and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required to record any charge-off that its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe, in good faith, would not be
permissible under GAAP, applicable banking regulations, or other applicable
Law; and

   

   (b) maintain their Loan Loss Reserve and Loan Repurchase Reserve in a

Reserve in amounts, consistent with their past practices and as required by
applicable banking regulations, GAAP and their loan policies and procedures.

   

   5.6 _Pricing of Deposits and Loans_. Following the date of this Agreement
and to and including the Effective Time, South and its Subsidiaries will make
pricing decisions with respect to deposit accounts and Loans in a manner
consistent with their past practices based on competition and prevailing
market rates in their banking markets.

   

   5.7 _Consents to Assignment of Contracts_. With respect to each Contract
identified on Section 3.14(b) of the South Disclosure Schedule, South will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, the written
consent of that other party in a form reasonably satisfactory to North.

   

   5.8 _No Control of Other Party. _Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

North shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of South and North
shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and
South and North shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to
their respective stockholders.

   

   

        49     
  
  
    

   

   (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file and cause their
Subsidiaries to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties or Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto agree to use reasonable best efforts to prepare
and file and cause their Subsidiaries to prepare and file all necessary
documentation, and to file all applications, notices, petitions and filings,
in connection with obtaining all Requisite Regulatory Approvals as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. South and North shall have the
right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult
the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, all information relating to South or North, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein,
including by delivery of a copy of any applications, notices, petitions or
filings made by a party to the other party, subject to the limitations set
forth above. Wherever practicable under the circumstances, each party shall
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity scheduled in advance for the express purpose of discussing
applications for approval of the transactions contemplated herein and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require either party to, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities or
third parties, take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation (assuming for this purpose that
the Surviving Corporation consists of South and North and their respective
Subsidiaries taken as a whole) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ "), _provided_ that the sale of one or more branches of South or
North in a geographic banking market shall not constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there would be, a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition.

   

   

        50     
  
  
    

   

   (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, with respect
to permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of South and North shall use its reasonable best efforts to,
and cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, (i) avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Law so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require South or North to take any
actions specified in this Section 6.1(c) that would reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

   

   (d) South and North shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of North, South
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of North and South agrees that none of
the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the
stockholders of South and North and at the time of the South Meeting and the
North Meeting, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of North and South
further agrees that, if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it
would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to
be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, it will promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

   

   (e) North and South shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

   

   6.2 _Access to Information_.

   

   (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each of North
and South, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and the compliance of the other with its covenants and of preparing
for the Merger and the Bank Merger and other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
Representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties,
employees, systems, Representatives, agents, books, Contracts, commitments and
records, and, during such period, each of North and South shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available (it being understood
that documents available via the SEC's EDGAR system are deemed to have been
made available for purposes of this covenant) (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it or
any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than reports
or documents not permitted to be disclosed under applicable Law), and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
party may reasonably request. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall
be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of business of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries.

   

   

        51     
  
  
    

   

   (b) Each of North and South shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives
pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated
February 14, 2014, between North and South (as amended, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

   

   (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.

   

   6.3 _Stockholders ' Approvals_.

   

   (a) Each of North and South shall take all action necessary in accordance
with applicable Law and their respective articles of incorporation,
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents to
duly call, give notice of, convene and, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective, hold a meeting of its stockholders or,
except as otherwise provided herein, use its reasonable best efforts to take
such other actions necessary to obtain the relevant stockholder approvals, in
each case as promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite North Vote, in the case of North, and the Requisite South Vote, in
the case of South (each such meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _North Meeting_ " and the " _South Meeting_ ", respectively)
but subject to Section 6.3(e). Without the prior written consent of the other
party, neither party hereto shall submit any proposal to its stockholders at
the North Meeting or the South Meeting, as applicable, except as contemplated
by this Agreement. North shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, the Requisite North Vote at the North Meeting, and South shall
solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Requisite South
Vote at the South Meeting.

   

   

        52     
  
  
    

   

   (b) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.3(b), the Board of
Directors of North and South shall (i) recommend to its respective
stockholders the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, as applicable (including, in the case of North, the North
Charter Amendment) (the " _Board Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the Board
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and (iii) with respect to South,
not approve, agree to or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of South shall be permitted (x) not to
recommend to its stockholders that they give the Requisite South Vote, (y) not
to include the Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, or (z) to
otherwise withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to North the Board
Recommendation (the actions described in clauses (x), (y) and (z), each a "
_Change in Board Recommendation_ "), in each case, in response to (i) a
material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that does not
relate to a Superior Proposal (which is addressed in the following clause
(ii)) and is unknown to and not reasonably foreseeable by the South Board of
Directors as of the date of this Agreement but becomes known to or by the
South Board of Directors prior to South obtaining the Requisite South Vote (an
" _Intervening Event_ "), or (ii) the receipt of an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors of South
determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is
a Superior Proposal, in each case, if, and only if, the Board of Directors of
South determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of
outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Change in Board Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Board of Directors of South may not make a Change in Board Recommendation
unless (A) five business days (subject to extension as set forth below in this
sentence) shall have elapsed following delivery by South to North of written
notice advising North that South's Board of Directors intends to resolve to
effect a Change in Board Recommendation absent modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice shall include a reasonable
description of the event or circumstances giving rise to the decision to
effect a Change in Board Recommendation (including, the event such action is
taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof), (B) at the end of such
five business day notice period (during which period South shall have
negotiated with North in good faith (to the extent North desires to
negotiate)) the Board of Directors of South takes into account any amendment
or modification to this Agreement proposed by North and (C) after receiving
the advice of outside legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters, a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, the Board of Directors
of South determines in good faith that it nevertheless would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to make the Change in Board
Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that, following any material revision
to an Acquisition Proposal, South shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to North in accordance with this sentence and to again comply with the
requirements of this sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, (1) nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to excuse either
party from complying with its obligation to submit this Agreement to its
stockholders at the North Meeting or the South Meeting, as applicable, or from
complying with the obligations set forth in Section 6.3(e), and (2) South
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal or
Alternative Transaction other than the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing,
if the Board of Directors of South has effected a Change in Board
Recommendation as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3(b), then the Board
of Directors of South may submit this Agreement to its stockholders without
the Board Recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board
of Directors of South may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

   

   

        53     
  
  
    

   

   (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means, with
respect to South, a bona fide, unsolicited written offer made by a third party
that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case of a direct
merger between such person and South, the stockholder or stockholders of such
person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, 50% of the voting power of the
capital stock of South or all or substantially all the assets of South and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, the Board of Directors of
South determines in its good faith judgment (after taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of the offer and this Agreement (including any
proposal by North to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement),
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
and expected timing and risks of consummation, the form of consideration
offered and the ability of the person making such proposal to obtain
financing, and after taking into account all other legal, financial,
strategic, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including the
identity of the person making such proposal, and this Agreement) is more
favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger.

   

   (d) South and North shall cooperate to schedule and convene the South
Meeting and the North Meeting on the same date.

   

   (e) Each party shall cooperate and keep the other party informed on a
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of each
party. If at any time following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement
(i) South reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite North Vote is
unlikely to be obtained at the North Meeting, or (ii) North reasonably
determines in good faith that the Requisite South Vote is unlikely to be
obtained at the South Meeting, then prior to the vote contemplated having been
taken such party may request that the other party adjourn or postpone its
meeting for up to 45 days from the then-scheduled date, and the other party
shall comply with such request. During such period of adjournment or
postponement, the parties shall continue in all respects to comply with their
obligations under this Section 6.3 and shall in good faith use reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein
(it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration in a manner adverse to
such party or its stockholders) and, subject to this Section 6.3, seek to
obtain the Requisite North Vote or the Requisite South Vote, as the case may
be. Except as set forth in this Section 6.3(e), no party shall have the
obligation to postpone or adjourn its stockholder meeting.

   

   6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger. _Subject in all respects to Sections
6.1, 6.3 and 6.11, each of North and South shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by South or North or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

   

   6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. North shall cause the shares of North Class
A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on
NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

   

   

        54     
  
  
    

   

 

 

   

   

   6.6 _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

   

   (a) At the Effective Time, each employee of South who is then currently
employed by South automatically shall become an employee of North (a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") without any action by that employee, South or North.
Except to the extent otherwise provided in a written agreement with a
Continuing Employee which is entered into or assumed by North, the employment
of each Continuing Employee will be on an "at will" basis in such position, at
such location within North's system and for such rate of compensation as shall
be determined by North in the ordinary course of its business, and nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an employment agreement between
North and any such person, to obligate North to continue to employ any such
person for any specific term or period of time in any specific position or at
any specific salary or rate of compensation, or at all, or to restrict North's
right to terminate the employment of any such person at any time following the
Effective Time and for any reason satisfactory to North.

   

   (b) Following the Effective Time, except for any period while the
comparable South Benefit Plans are continued, each Continuing Employee shall
be entitled to participate in employee benefit plans provided generally by
North to its employees from time to time on the same basis and subject to the
same eligibility and vesting requirements and other conditions, restrictions
and limitations, as generally are in effect and applicable to other new
employees of North; _provided_ , for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, and vesting under North's Section 401(k) plan, and participation
in North's employee benefits generally, as well as for purposes of benefit
accrual under North's paid time off and position elimination policies, each
Continuing Employee will be given credit for his or her time of service with
South prior to the Effective Time based on his or her date of hire reflected
in South's employment records; provided further, that Continuing Employees
whose employment with North is terminated within 12 months after the Closing
Date will receive severance payments equal to the greater of those severance
payments that (i) they would receive from North or (ii) they would have
received from South if their employment with South had been terminated
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall any Continuing Employee be or become eligible to participate in,
or for benefits under, North's defined benefit pension plan (which has been
frozen to new participants) (the " _North Pension Plan_ "). The terms of
participation by Continuing Employees in North's health, dental and vision
insurance plans and other programs that are part of North's Cafeteria Plan
shall include the waiver of any waiting periods.

   

   (c) Following the Effective Time, North agrees to provide participants in
South's defined benefit pension plan as described in Section 3.11(a) of the
South Disclosure Schedule (the " _South Pension Plan_ ") with substantially
the same pension and other retirement benefits as currently provided under the
South Pension Plan, provided, however that North may amend or modify the South
Pension Plan in a manner substantially comparable to amendments or
modifications to the North Pension Plan, or terminate the South Pension Plan
if the North Pension Plan is terminated.

   

   (d) With respect to the First Citizens Long-Term Compensation Plan
described in Section 3.11(a) of the South Disclosure Schedule and awards
issued thereunder prior to the Closing, North shall assume the obligations of
South to pay the amounts awarded prior to the Closing at the time and in the
manner provided by such South Benefit Plan (without making any amendment to
such South Benefit Plan or awards or accelerating or deferring the timing of
any payment) and to observe the administrative provisions of such South
Benefit Plan, but North shall have no obligation to make any additional awards
under such South Benefit Plan.

   

   

        55     
  
  
    

   

   (e) With respect to the Deferred Compensation Plan of First Citizens Bank
and Trust Company of South Carolina and the 409A Deferred Compensation Plan of
First Citizens Bank and Trust Company, Inc. described in Section 3.11(a) of
the South Disclosure Schedule, North shall pay the retirement accounts of each
participant as such retirement accounts exist as of Closing plus interest
accrued subsequent to Closing on such retirement accounts in accordance with
such South Benefit Plans at the time and in the manner provided by such South
Benefit Plan. North shall not make any amendment or modification to such South
Benefit Plan that results in the participant being liable for the excise tax,
interest charge or other adverse consequences imposed by Section 409A of the
Code.

   

   (f) Prior to the Effective Time, South and each of its Subsidiaries shall
cooperate with North to allow North, in its reasonable discretion, to (i)
arrange and conduct for Continuing Employees an open enrollment period for the
North Benefit Plans (to the extent any such plans will be made available to
the applicable Continuing Employee) and employee orientation sessions (with
such sessions to be held at times reasonably agreed to by North and South),
and (ii) meet with employees of South and its Subsidiaries at reasonable times
as mutually agreed to by North and South.

   

   (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of North or South or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, South, North or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation,
South, North or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate
the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of North or
South or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to (i) establish, amend or modify any South Benefit Plan, North Benefit Plan
or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement, Contract or
arrangement, or (ii) except as expressly provided herein, alter or limit the
ability of North, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular South Benefit Plan,
North Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement, Contract or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Section
6.6, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person,
including without limitation any current or former employee, officer, director
or consultant of North or South or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates,
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Section 6.6.

   

   

        56     
  
  
    

   

   (h) As used in this Agreement, the term " _North Benefit Plans_ " means
all employee benefit plans (as defined in ERISA), whether or not subject to
ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and
all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance plans, programs or
arrangements or other material compensatory Contracts to or with respect to
which North or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of North or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together with North
would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of
ERISA (a " _North ERISA Affiliate_ "), is a party or has any current or future
obligation or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by North or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective North ERISA Affiliates for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or independent
contractor of North or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
North ERISA Affiliates, in each case to the extent material.

   

   6.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

   

   (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
South or any of its Subsidiaries and any person who is or was serving at or
prior to the Effective Time as a director or officer (or in a like capacity)
of another person at the request of South or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _South Indemnified Parties_ ") as and to the extent each
such South Indemnified Party would have had a right to be indemnified by South
(or any of its Subsidiaries), under their respective articles of incorporation
and bylaws in existence as of the date hereof against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of South or any of its Subsidiaries or serving as a
director or officer (or in a like capacity) of another person at the request
of South or any of its Subsidiaries and in respect of any acts or omissions
(or alleged acts or omissions) of or by any such South Indemnified Party
occurring (or alleged to have occurred) at or prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and the Surviving
Corporation shall advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, _provided_ that the South Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if its ultimately
determined that such South Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

   

   (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by South ( _provided_
, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
South for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, South, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of North,
may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
South's existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, on an annual basis, does not
exceed the Premium Cap.

consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall also assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.
The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each South
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

North, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of South, on the other hand) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to, in
the name and on behalf of South and North, execute and deliver such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and take all such other action as may
be necessary in connection therewith.

   

   6.9 _Advice of Changes. _North and South shall each promptly advise the
other party of (a) any change or event (i) that has had or would reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, (b) any
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party that, if
pending on the date hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement, and (c) any notice or other communication from any
person or Governmental Entity alleging that the consent of such person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that nothing disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall affect or
be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties set forth
herein, and _provided_ further that any failure to give notice in accordance
with the foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set
forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case
unless the underlying change or event would independently result in a failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

   

   6.10 _Dividends._ After the date of this Agreement, each of North and
South shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in

fail to receive one (1) dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of South Common Stock and any shares of North Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

   

   

        58     
  
  
    

   

   6.11 _Acquisition Proposals_. South agrees that it will not, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries and controlled affiliates not to, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other retained representatives or agents (each, a "
_Representative_ ") not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing
information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries,
requests for nonpublic information, offers or proposals that contemplate or
otherwise relate to or could reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative
Transaction (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Alternative Transaction or Acquisition Proposal or (iii) furnish
any information regarding itself or any of its Subsidiaries to any person in
connection with or in response to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, prior to receipt of the Requisite South Vote, in the
event that South receives an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited by it
and did not otherwise result from a breach of or any action inconsistent with
this Section 6.11, and that the Board of Directors of South determines, in its
good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal (and such proposal has not been withdrawn), if and only if, the Board
of Directors of South determines, in its good faith judgment, after receiving
the advice of outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that failure to take any of the actions described in the following
clauses (A) and (B) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, South and its Representatives may (A) furnish information with
respect to it and its Subsidiaries to the party making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives and financing sources pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less restrictive to the party
making the Acquisition Proposal than the terms contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that a copy of all such written
information is provided simultaneously to North (if not previously provided),
and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions
contained in this Section 6.11 by any Subsidiary or Representative of South,
shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.11 by South.

   

   (a) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " shall mean,
with respect to South, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity
investment, joint venture, issuance of securities, reorganization, tender
offer, sale, license, disposition or otherwise) by any person or "group" as
defined in the Exchange Act of 15% or more of the assets of South or any of
its Subsidiaries; (ii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly,
by any person or "group" of 15% or more of any class of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of South or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii)
the issuance of 15% or more of the current number of issued and outstanding
shares of any class of capital stock of South or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any person (or the stockholders of any person) or
"group" becoming the beneficial owner of 15% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of South or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of South and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

   

   

        59     
  
  
    

   

   (b) South shall notify North promptly (but in no event later than one
business day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to South or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the properties, books or records of South or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person that has made, or to South's knowledge is
considering making, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the
identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or
considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public
information or access to the books and records of South or any of its
Subsidiaries and shall include a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal and
the material terms of any oral Acquisition Proposal or modification or
amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. South shall keep North fully informed,
on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material
changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request.

   

   (c) South shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than North) conducted
heretofore with respect to or that relate to any Acquisition Proposal. South
has not and, unless the Board of Directors of South determines in its good
faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release
any third party from, and also agrees to enforce, the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any Contract to which it or its Subsidiaries is a
party that remains in effect as of the date hereof.

   

   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of South from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that
such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a modification of the Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to North unless the Board of Directors of
South expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Board Recommendation.

   

   6.12 _Public Announcements. _South and North shall consult with and
provide each other with the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not
issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation, except if such issuance, statement or comment is required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange and compliance with this Section 6.12 is not
practicable.

   

   

        60     
  
  
    

   

   6.13 _Real Property Matters_.

   

   (a) At its option and expense, following the date of this Agreement,
North may cause to be conducted (i) a title examination, physical survey,
zoning compliance review and structural inspection of any or all of the South
Real Property and improvements thereon (collectively, the " _Property
Examination_ ") and (ii) site inspections, environmental assessments, historic
reviews and regulatory analyses of any or all of the South Real Property,
together with such other studies, testing and intrusive sampling and analyses
as North shall deem necessary or desirable (collectively, the " _Environmental
Survey_ "); _provided, however_ , __ that any investigation or reviews
conducted by or on behalf of North shall be performed in such a manner as will
not interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of South or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no sampling or invasive investigations may be undertaken
without the prior written consent of South (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

   

   If, in the course of the Property Examination or Environmental Survey,
North identifies one or more Material Defects, North will give prompt written
notice thereof to South describing the facts or conditions constituting each
such Material Defect.

   

   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Material Defect_ " shall
include, except as Previously Disclosed:

   

   (i) the existence of any Lien (other than Permitted Encumbrances)
relating to any of the South Real Property, including without limitation the
existence of any facts or circumstances that adversely affect South's, South
Bank's or any South Subsidiary's ability to enforce any lease agreement or its
rights in any leasehold interest thereunder;

   

   (ii) the existence of any zoning restriction, easement, encroachment,
covenant, restriction or other defects or exceptions to title, or the
existence of any facts or conditions that constitute a breach of
representations and warranties (read without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representations or warranties) relating or with respect to any of the South
Real Property, in either such case that North reasonably believes will
materially and adversely affect (A) its use of the South Real Property for the
purpose for which and in the manner in which it currently is used or (B) the
value or marketability of the South Real Property;

   

   (iii) the existence of any structural defects or conditions of disrepair
in the improvements on any parcel of the South Real Property (including any
equipment, fixtures or other components related thereto);

   

   (iv) the existence of facts or circumstances relating to any of the South
Real Property and indicating that (A) there likely has been a discharge,
disposal, release, threatened release or emission by any person of any
Hazardous Substance on, from, under, at or relating to the South Real Property
or (B) any action has been taken or not taken, or a condition or event likely
has occurred or exists, with respect to the South Real Property (including,
without limitation, any removal or disposal of materials from the South Real
Property) which constitutes or would constitute a violation of any
Environmental Law or any Contract between South, South Bank or any South
Subsidiary and any other person or entity, as to which, in either such case,
North reasonably believes, based on the advice of legal counsel or other
consultants, that, before or after the Effective Time, South, South Bank, any
South Subsidiary or North, respectively, could incur costs or become
responsible or liable for assessment, removal, remediation, monetary damages
(including without limitation any liability to other persons for property
damage or personal injury) or civil, criminal or administrative penalties or
other corrective action; or

   

   

        61     
  
  
    

   

   (v) the existence of any "recognized environmental condition" on any
parcel of the South Real Property, as identified by any Environmental Survey.

   

   (c) In the event that North reasonably believes that (A) the total of the
costs and expenses that South, South Bank, the South Subsidiaries, North or
North Bank could incur in fully correcting all Material Defects identified by
North that are described in Section 6.13(b), plus (B) all other amounts for
which South, South Bank, the South Subsidiaries, North or North Bank could
become responsible or liable related to all of those Material Defects as
described in Section 6.13(b)(iv), would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on South, then North shall have the right and option,
as its sole remedy, exercisable upon written notice to South, to terminate
this Agreement. In the event that, following its investigation of any such
Material Defects, North concludes that it will terminate this Agreement as
provided in the preceding sentence, it will give prompt notice of termination
to South; _provided, however_ , __ that North shall not be obligated to give
any such notice while it continues in good faith to investigate, or to
determine the nature and cost of potential corrective actions, if any, to
remedy, any such Material Defect. In no event shall South be required to cure
or remedy any defect, including without limitation any Material Defect.

   

   (d) It is contemplated that North will conduct the Property Examination
and the Environmental Survey following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time. It is the intent of this Agreement, and South, South Bank
and the South Subsidiaries understand and agree that, upon completion of the
Property Examination and Environmental Survey, if any of the facts,
conditions, circumstances or other matters revealed by the Property
Examination or Environmental Survey reveal a Material Defect, then North may
exercise its rights under this Section 6.13 without regard to any actual
knowledge on or prior to the date of this Agreement on the part of North or
its officers or advisers of that Material Defect or the facts, conditions,
circumstances or other matters pertaining thereto and without regard to any
matters Previously Disclosed to North, or any other communication to North or
any of its officers or advisers, prior to the date of this Agreement, or
otherwise.

   

   (e) North shall not disclose the results of its investigations to any
other person except (i) as required by Law or (ii) to its attorneys,
accountants, or other consultants assisting it in connection with this
transaction, and in the case of subclause (ii), then only upon making each
such person aware of the confidentiality restrictions set forth herein and
procuring such person's agreement to be bound thereby. North shall promptly
repair any damage to any property of South, South Bank or any South
Subsidiary, and be responsible for any claims for personal injury or property
damage, resulting from North's investigations. Upon request, North shall
provide to South a copy of all written reports received by North from
consultants or other third parties engaged by North to perform such
investigations.

   ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

   

   8.1 _Termination. _This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time and, except as specified below, whether before or after
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of North or South:

   

   (a) by mutual consent of North and South in a written instrument
authorized by the Board of Directors of each;

   

   (b) by either North or South if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has (i) denied approval of the consummation of
any of the material transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger or Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or
any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of any of the material transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger or Bank Merger or (ii) granted the
Requisite Regulatory Approval but such Requisite Regulatory Approval contains
or results in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition
and there is no meaningful possibility that such Requisite Regulatory Approval
could be revised prior to the Termination Date so as not to contain or result
in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition, unless, in either case, the
failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval or to obtain a Requisite
Regulatory Approval without it containing or resulting in the imposition of a
Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

   

   (c) by either North or South if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before one year from the date of this Agreement (the "
_Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

   

   

        68     
  
  
    

   

   (d) by either North or South if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement by the other party, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party, such that any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 (in the case of a termination by North) or
Section 7.3 (in the case of a termination by South) would not be satisfied,
and (i) such breach is not reasonably capable of being cured or (ii) if such
breach is reasonably capable of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of
(A) the Termination Date or (B) the date that is 30 days following written
notice thereof to the party committing such breach; _provided_ in each case
that the terminating party is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party contained herein such that
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 (in the case of a termination
by South) or Section 7.3 (in the case of a termination by North) would not be
satisfied;

   

   (e) by either North or South if (i) the North Meeting (including any
postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded with the vote
contemplated by Section 4.3(a) having been taken and the Requisite North Vote
shall not have been obtained or (ii) the South Meeting (including any
postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded with the vote
contemplated by Section 3.3(a) having been taken and the Requisite South Vote
shall have not been obtained; _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall have complied in all material
respects with its obligations under Section 6.3 (including by complying with
an adjournment or postponement request under Section 6.3(e));

   

   (f) by North, prior to South obtaining the Requisite South Vote, if (i)
the Board of Directors of South shall have effected a Change in Board
Recommendation or (ii) South failed to comply in all material respects with
its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.11;

   

   (g) by South, prior to North obtaining the Requisite North Vote, if North
failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under Section
6.3;

   

   (h) by South, prior to obtaining the Requisite South Vote, if the Board
of Directors of South shall have effected a Change in Board Recommendation;
_provided_ South has complied with the requirements of Sections 6.3(b) and
6.11;

   

   (i) by North, pursuant to Section 6.13(c); or

   

   (j) by North, if holders of 10% of South Common Stock are deemed
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

   

   The party desiring to terminate this Agreement other than pursuant to
clause (a) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected and confirm
that the Board of Directors of such terminating party has authorized such
termination.

   

   8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

   

   (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either North or
South as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of North, South, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) and this
Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.1 and, except as it relates
to surviving provisions, Section 9.12) shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither North nor South shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or breach of any provision of
this Agreement (to the extent such breach is willful, knowing and material)
prior to termination.

   

   

        69     
  
  
    

   

   (b)

   

   (i) If South terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) as a
result of an Acquisition Proposal received by South within the 30-day period
following the date of this Agreement, then South will pay to North $6,450,000
and an amount equal to North's Documented Expenses.

   

   (ii) If South terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) as a
result of an Intervening Event, then South will pay to North $10,000,000 and
an amount equal to North's Documented Expenses.

   

   As used in this Agreement, " _Documented Expenses_ " shall mean a party's
aggregate documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in negotiating
and preparing this Agreement, performing due diligence and otherwise in
connection with or attempting to consummate the transactions described herein.

   

   (c) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of South or has been made directly to its
stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to South and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated (i) by either North or South pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(ii), (ii) by North pursuant to Section 8.1(d), (iii) by South or North
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if the Requisite South Vote had not been obtained
prior to termination and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and
7.3 had been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such
termination), (iv) by North pursuant to Section 8.1(f), or (v) by South
pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and no fee is payable by South pursuant to Section
8.2(b), then South shall pay to North an amount equal to (A) North's
Documented Expenses and (B) if, prior to the date that is 12 months after the
date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence,
South enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an
Alternative Transaction (whether or not involving the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to in this subsection (c)), then South shall, on the
date of entry into such agreement, or on the date of consummation if the
Alternative Transaction is consummated without entry into a definitive
agreement, pay North $22,574,000, _provided_ , that for purposes of this
Section 8.2(c), all references in the definition of Alternative Transaction to
15% shall instead refer to 50%.

   

   (d) South shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Each of North and South agrees that, upon termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable to North and
such Termination Fee is paid in full, North shall be precluded from any other
remedy (other than with respect to any liability resulting from any willful
breach of this Agreement or intentional misconduct) against South in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, at law
or in equity or otherwise, and it shall not seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect or punitive
damages, against South or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
" _Termination Fee_ " shall mean the aggregate amount payable (other than
interest, if any, due from South under Section 8.2(e)) by a party under this
Section 8.2.

   

   

        70     
  
  
    

   

   (e) South acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, North would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if South fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, North commences a suit
which results in a judgment against South for the Termination Fee or any
portion thereof, South shall pay the costs and expenses of North (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if South fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
8.2, then it shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ ) in
effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid.

   

   (f) All payments under this Section 8.2 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by North, and
shall be made (i) in the case of the Termination Fee payable pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), for that portion of the Termination Fee constituting
Documented Expenses, within two business days after receipt of an invoice for
the Documented Expenses, and for the remainder of such Termination Fee, within
two business days after the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) in the
case of the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(c), for that
portion of the Termination Fee constituting Documented Expenses, within two
business days after receipt of an invoice for the Documented Expenses, and for
the remainder of such Termination Fee, within two business days after entry
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummation of, an
Alternative Transaction.

   

   (g) In the event that North shall have the right to receive the
Termination Fee, the right to receive the Termination Fee, if any, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy (other than interest, if any, due from South
under Section 8.2(e) and with respect to any liability resulting from any
willful breach of this Agreement or intentional misconduct) against South and
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives for any and all losses suffered by
North or any of North's Subsidiaries or Representatives in connection with, or
as a result of the failure, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated.

   

   8.3 _Amendment. _Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the stockholders of
North and South; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption and approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the respective
stockholders of North or South, there may not be, without further approval of
such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or
the form of the consideration to be delivered hereunder to the holders of
South Common Stock or that otherwise requires the approval of such
stockholders under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

   

   

        71     
  
  
    

   

   8.4 _Extension; Waiver. _At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions
contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption and approval
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the respective
stockholders of North or South, there may not be, without further approval of
such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
thereof which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to
be delivered to the holders of South Common Stock hereunder or that otherwise
requires the approval of such stockholders under applicable Law. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

   9.5 _Interpretation. _The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." References to "the date hereof"
shall mean the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the "
_knowledge_ " of South means the conscious awareness of any of the officers of
South listed on Section 9.5 of the South Disclosure Schedule and includes
matters of which such individuals should have been consciously aware in the
ordinary course of business and performance of their managerial duties, and
the " _knowledge_ " of North means the conscious awareness of any of the
officers of North listed on Section 9.5 of the North Disclosure Schedule and
includes matters of which such individuals should have been consciously aware
in the ordinary course of business and performance of their managerial duties.
As used herein, (a) the term " _person_ " means any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity of any kind or nature, and (b) an " _affiliate_ " of a
specified person is any person that directly or indirectly controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with such specified person. The South
Disclosure Schedule and the North Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other
schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and
included in any reference to this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall
require any party or person to take any action in violation of applicable Law.

   

   9.6 _Disclosure Schedule_.

   

   (a) Before entry into this Agreement, South delivered to North a schedule
(a " _South Disclosure Schedule_ ") and North delivered to South a schedule (a
" _North Disclosure Schedule_ " and, together with the South Disclosure
Schedule, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), each of which sets forth, among
other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Article III or Article IV, respectively, or to one or more
covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be
set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty or covenant if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect or the related covenant being breached, (ii) the
Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and information solely for
informational purposes and (iii) the mere inclusion of an item in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect or is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement.

   

   

        74     
  
  
    

   

   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means
information set forth by South or North in the South Disclosure Schedule or
North Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. Any fact or item set forth in any
section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be referred to and
incorporated in any other section(s) of such Disclosure Schedule to which it
is specifically referenced or cross-referenced, and also in any other
section(s) of such Disclosure Schedule (whether or not a specific cross-
reference appears therein) if the relevance of such fact or item (or its
contents) to such other section(s) of such Disclosure Schedule is reasonably
apparent on its face.

   

   9.7 _Counterparts. _This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

   

   9.8 _Entire Agreement. _This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

   

   9.9 _Governing_ _Law ; Jurisdiction_.

   

   (a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to any applicable
conflicts of law, except that (i) the Merger and the Bank Merger shall be
governed by the laws of the States of South Carolina, North Carolina and
Delaware, as applicable, and (ii) matters relating to the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of South and the Board of Directors of North,
dissenters' rights and similar or related internal affairs matters shall be
subject to the laws of the State of South Carolina or the State of Delaware,
as applicable.

   

   (b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in
respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina or the North Carolina
Business Court, Raleigh, North Carolina, or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any other North Carolina State court in Wake County, North
Carolina (such courts, the " _North Carolina Courts_ "), and, solely in
connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that
are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the North Carolina Courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom), (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the North Carolina Courts, (iii) waives any objection
that the North Carolina Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such
party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in
accordance with Section 9.4.

   

   

        75     
  
  
    

   

   9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. _Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as set forth
in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

   

   9.11 _Specific Performance. _The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties' obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties
hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with any such remedy.

   

   9.12 _Severability. _Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but, if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

   

   9.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. _This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
