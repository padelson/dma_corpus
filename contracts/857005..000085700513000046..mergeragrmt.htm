period). The Buyer shall promptly cooperate with the Securityholders'

Expenses are greater than the Transaction Expenses specified in the Allocation
Certificate, plus (E) the employer portion of employment taxes with respect to
Employee Bonuses and the Merger Consideration payable at Closing in respect of

Securityholders' Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
disbursement instructions for the Final Adjustment Amount in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement. If the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the
Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent the Stockholders' and SVB's aggregate Pro

in a written document executed by the Buyer and the Securityholders'
Representative and such written document shall be deemed final and binding for
all purposes of this Agreement. If they are unable to resolve any differences

such remaining differences will be submitted to an Independent Accountant for
prompt determination. The Independent Accountant will determine those matters
in dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters, which
report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by
the Securityholders and fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer; provided, that upon
resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accountant, the prevailing party,
if any, as determined by the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Independent Accountant, shall be entitled to be reimbursed in proportion to
the amount by which the other party's determinations of the items in dispute

shall be determined by the Independent Accountant. Any fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountant to be paid by the Securityholders will be paid out
of the Escrow Amount, and the Buyer and the Securityholders' Representative
shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent disbursement instructions for
the amount of such fees and expenses to be paid by the Securityholders from
the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

  

(e) No Impairment of Other Rights. The Allocation Certificate (and the
agreement thereto) and the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount under
this Section 1.7 shall not impair any other rights of a party under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any rights to indemnification.

  

  

  

1.8 Earn-Out. The following provisions shall apply with respect to the Earn-
Out Consideration, if any:

Founders and the Securityholders' Representative a report that contains the

preceding fiscal quarter.

soon as practical following the conclusion of the fiscal first quarter of
Buyer's fiscal year 2015 and quarterly thereafter during the Earn-Out Period,
and in any event not later than ninety (90) days after such dates, the Buyer
shall prepare a calculation of the amount of the Earn-Out Consideration (the
"Earn-Out Calculation"), if any, payable with respect to the Earn-Out Period,
and shall deliver a copy of the Earn-Out Calculation with reasonable back-up
data and a statement showing the method of computing the applicable Earn-Out
Consideration, if any, to the Securityholders' Representative. The Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation shall keep complete and accurate records in
sufficient detail to enable the Securityholders' Representative to calculate
and determine the Earn-Out Consideration, whether or not the Earn-Out
Consideration for the Earn-Out Period was earned.

  

  

  

(c) Earn-Out Consideration Disputes. If the Securityholders' Representative
disagrees with the Earn-Out Calculation, the Securityholders' Representative
shall notify the Buyer in writing in reasonable detail of the Securityholders'
Representative and the basis therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such Earn-Out Calculation (the "Earn-Out Objection"). If the Earn-Out
Objection is not received by the Buyer within such period, the Earn-Out
Calculation prepared by the Buyer shall be deemed final and binding for all
purposes of this Agreement and the amount of any Earn-Out Consideration shall
be paid by the Buyer within five (5) Business Days following such thirty (30)
day period. If the Buyer does receive an Earn-Out Objection within such
period, the Buyer and the Securityholders' Representative shall attempt in
good faith to promptly resolve any differences within thirty (30) days after
timely delivery of an Earn-Out Objection. If the Buyer and the
Securityholders' Representative resolve their disagreement, they shall set
forth the agreement in a written document executed by the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  Buyer and the Securityholders' Representative and such written document
shall be deemed final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. If the
Buyer and the Securityholders' Representative are unable to resolve their
disagreement within such period, any remaining differences will be submitted
to an Independent Accountant for prompt determination. The Independent
Accountant will be instructed by the Buyer and the Securityholders'
Representative to determine those matters in dispute and render a written
report as to the disputed matters within thirty (30) days of such submission,
which report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall initially be borne fifty percent
(50%) by the Securityholders and fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer; provided,
that upon resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accountant, the
prevailing party, if any, as determined by the Independent Accountant, shall
be entitled to be reimbursed in proportion to the amount by which the other
party's determinations of the items in dispute differed from the amount
determined by the Independent Accountant. Such amount shall be determined by
the Independent Accountant. Any fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant to be paid by the Securityholders will first be paid out of the
Escrow Amount, and the Buyer and the Securityholders' Representative shall
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent disbursement instructions for the
amount of such fees and expenses to be paid by the Securityholders from the
Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Earn-Out Consideration as
finally determined by the Independent Accountant shall be paid promptly upon
delivery of the Independent Accountant's written report with interest accruing
from the tenth (10th) Business Day following such delivery in an amount equal
to the lesser of the prime rate reported in the Wall Street Journal on such
date, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

 

  

  

  

(d) Payment. Subject to Section 11.5(d) (Set-Off), the Buyer shall pay the
Stockholders' and SVB's aggregate Pro Rata Share of the applicable Earn-Out
Consideration, if any, no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
final resolution of the applicable Earn-Out Consideration pursuant to Section
1.8(c) (Earn-Out Consideration Disputes), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Paying Agent for payment to the Stockholders and SVB,
and shall pay the remaining portion of such Earn-Out Consideration to the
Surviving Corporation for payment to the former holders of the Company
Options, in each case, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share no
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the final resolution of the
applicable Earn-Out Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(c) (Earn-Out
Consideration Disputes).

  

  

  

(e) Contract Right Only. The right to receive the Earn-Out Consideration, if
any, payable pursuant to this Agreement is a contract right only and no
certificate evidencing such right shall be issued. The right to receive the
Earn-Out Consideration, if any, payable pursuant to this Agreement shall not
be transferred or assigned and no beneficial interests therein may be pledged,
sold, assigned or transferred by any Securityholder.

  

  

  

(f) Earn-Out Acceleration Event. If an Earn-Out Acceleration Event occurs and
if a portion of the Earn-Out Consideration appears reasonably likely to become
payable at the end of the Earn-Out Period, to be estimated by assuming that
the operating results for the immediately preceding three (3) month period
would continue for the remainder of the Earn-Out Period, then a proportionate
amount of the Earn-Out Consideration shall become due and payable immediately
upon the occurrence of any such event as though the Earn-Out Period had
concluded upon the occurrence of the Earn-Out Acceleration Event. If following
the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  consummation of the Earn-Out Acceleration Event any Earn-Out Consideration
becomes due and payable pursuant to this Agreement, an amount equal to the
Earn-Out Consideration then due and payable less the payment made pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence shall then be payable to the
Securityholders in accordance with this Agreement. "Earn-Out Acceleration
Event" shall mean the occurrence of any one of the following events prior to
the conclusion of the Earn-Out Period (i) the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation undergoes a Change of Control and the Buyer (or the successor
thereto) does not confirm in writing to honor the terms of this Agreement,

appointed for the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or a substantial part of
their respective property, and such proceeding or appointment is not dismissed
or discharged within sixty (60) days after its commencement; (v) the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation is unable to, or admits in writing its inability to,
pay its debts when they become due and the Buyer (or the successor thereto)

confirmation; (vi) the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation makes an assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the

Surviving Corporation takes any action effectuating, approving or consenting
to any of the foregoing in clauses (iii) to (vi). For the sake of clarity, the
merger or other roll-up or combination of the Surviving Corporation with the
Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer shall not be deemed to be an Earn-Out
Acceleration Event.

Certificate representing outstanding shares of the Company Stock (i) a letter
of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-2 (the "Company Stock
Letter of Transmittal") specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates and (ii) instructions for surrendering such Certificate in
exchange for the applicable Per Share Net Closing Consideration for each share
of the Company Stock represented by such Certificate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation together with such Company
Stock Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the Buyer
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, immediately subsequent to Closing, to
each Stockholder the Per Share Net Closing Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the shares of the Company Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. It shall be a
condition to the right of any person, other than the registered holder of a
Certificate, to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable with
respect to each share of the Company Stock represented by such Certificate
that (i) the Certificate be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (ii) the person surrendering such Certificate shall pay the
allocable share, as determined under Section 6.6 (Certain Taxes) of any

establish to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. The Buyer shall instruct the Paying Agreement to make payment
of the foregoing consideration, for any Stockholder who has submitted a
Company Stock Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and the related
Certificates, prior to the Closing, by check or, if wire instructions have
been provided, by same day wire transfer, as soon as practicable but in any
event within one (1) Business Day after the Effective Time, and for all other
Stockholders, within two (2) Business Days following receipt by the Paying
Agent of a Company Stock Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and the related
Certificates.

shall send or cause the Paying Agent to send to SVB (i) a letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-3 (the "SVB Letter of
Transmittal") specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the SVB Warrant shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the SVB
Warrant and (ii) instructions for surrendering the SVB Warrant in exchange for
the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. Upon surrender
of the SVB Warrant for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, SVB shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the SVB Warrant Net Closing Consideration in respect
thereof, and the SVB Warrant so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the SVB Warrant Merger
Consideration payable to SVB.

  

  

  

(c) Certificate Lost, Stolen or Destroyed. In the event the SVB Warrant or any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Buyer shall issue
or cause to be issued the respective Merger Consideration in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed SVB Warrant or Certificate only following delivery
by the holder thereof of an affidavit of that fact and such indemnities
against any claim that may be made against the Buyer with respect to the SVB
Warrant or Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed as are
requested by the Paying Agent.

  

  

  

(d) Return of Funds from Paying Agent. Any portion of amounts deposited with
the Paying Agent that remain undistributed to the Securityholders six (6)
months after their

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  deposit with the Paying Agent shall, at the request of the Surviving
Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according
to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the
Company Securities who have not surrendered such Company Securities in
compliance with this Section 1.11 shall after such delivery to the Surviving
Corporation, look only to the Surviving Corporation solely as general
creditors for the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.9 (Effect of the
Merger). To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any such amounts
deposited with the Paying Agent remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Securities immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

  

  

  

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1,
none of the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Securityholders' Representative or any party hereto shall be
liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official in
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

  

1.12 Dissenters Rights. Shares of the Company Stock held as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time by a Stockholder who has not voted such shares in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and with respect to
which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or forfeited before the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
pursuant to Section 1.9 (Effect of Merger), but shall thereafter constitute
only the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration of
the cancellation of such shares, such consideration as may be determined to be
due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. If a holder
of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") forfeits or withdraws such
right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then such holder's Dissenting Shares
shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into and to represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of the Company Stock pursuant
to Section 1.9 (Effect of Merger), without interest.

  

  

  

1.13 Tax Withholding; Treatment of Additional Payments. The Buyer, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, or the Escrow Agent, as
the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to or for the
benefit of any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. The Company, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders' Representative and the Securityholders agree to treat any
adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.7(c) (Post-Closing
True-Up) and any payment of Earn-Out Consideration, if any, as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  do so by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a determination as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code. Payments of Earn-Out Consideration, if any, will
be taxed to holders of the Company Options just as any other income such
holder of the Company Options may receive as compensation for services.

 

  

  

  

1.14 Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Sub, the officers and
directors from time to time of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name of the Company and the Merger Sub, as the case may be, or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action as is
consistent with this Agreement.

any permitted extensions thereto. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and
complete in all material respects, and all Taxes owed by the Company, whether
or not shown on any Tax Return, have been paid when due. The Company is not
currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return. No claim has ever been made in writing by any taxing authority in
any jurisdiction in which the Company does not file that the Company is or may
be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. To the Knowledge of the Company,
except for the employment and withholding Tax liabilities of the Company
resulting from the payment of Sale Bonuses and consideration in respect of the
Company Options as provided herein, no Taxes will become payable by the
Company as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.

  

  

  

(b) No audit or other similar examination is currently pending with respect to
any Tax Return of the Company and the Company has not received any written
notice from any taxing authority that an audit or other review is forthcoming.
No deficiency for any Taxes has been asserted, proposed, or threatened in
writing against the Company, which deficiency has not been paid in full, and
the Company is not aware of any such deficiency which is reasonably likely to
be asserted. No issue relating to the Company or involving any Tax for which
the Company might be liable has been resolved in favor of any taxing authority
in any audit or examination that, by application of the same principles, would
reasonably be expected to result in a deficiency for Taxes of the Company for
any other period. The Company has not

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  participated or engaged in any "reportable transaction" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax Law.

 

  

  

  

(c) Schedule 2.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all United
States federal, state and local, and all foreign income Tax Returns filed with
respect to the Company, and indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited
or subject to similar examination by a taxing authority and those Tax Returns
that currently are the subject of audit or such examination. There are no
outstanding agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the statutory period
of limitation (or any other period during which any Tax can be assessed)
applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection or assessment
of, Taxes due from or with respect to the Company for any taxable period, and
no closing agreement (within the meaning of Section 7121 of the Code) relating
to the Taxes of the Company is currently in force. The Company has delivered
to the Buyer, or made available the true, complete and correct copies of all
Tax Returns, audit reports, and statements of deficiencies for each of the
last three taxable years filed by or issued to or with respect to the Company
(or, insofar as such items relate to the Company, by or to any affiliated,
consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company was then a
member).

  

  

  

(d) The unpaid Taxes of the Company for all taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending (i) on or before the Interim Balance Sheet Date did not, as of
such date, exceed the reserve for tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any
notes thereof) and (ii) on or before the Closing Date will not, as of the
Closing Date, exceed that reserve as adjusted to reflect the ordinary
operations of the Company after the Interim Balance Sheet Date and through the
Closing Date and the Transactions in accordance with the past customs and
practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns.

  

  

  

(e) The Surviving Corporation will not be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii)
intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state or local income Tax law), (iv) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, (v) prepaid
amount received on or prior to the Closing Date, or (vi) or election under
Section 108(i) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign income Tax law).

  

  

  

(f) No person holds the Company Stock that is subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code) with respect to
which a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code has not been made, and
no payment to any holder of the Company Stock of any portion of the
consideration payable hereunder will result in compensation or other income to
such person with respect to which the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation would
be required to deduct or withhold any Tax. Schedule 2.10(f) lists (i) each
person that has, to the Knowledge of the Company, disposed of any Company
Stock in a

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  transaction that would constitute a "disqualifying disposition" (as
defined in Section 421(b) of the Code) together with a schedule of the stock
disposed of in such transaction and the exercise date of the option pursuant
to which such stock was acquired and (ii) each person for whom the
Transactions would constitute a disqualifying disposition.

 

  

  

  

(g) The Company has never been (i) a member of any affiliated group filing or
required to file a consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Return or (ii) a
party to or bound by, nor does it have or has it ever had any obligation
under, any Tax sharing agreement or similar contract or arrangement. The
Company has no liability for the Taxes of any other Person under U.S. Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of applicable federal, state,
local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

  

  

  

(h) The Company has not distributed to its stockholders or security holders
stock or securities of a controlled corporation in a transaction to which
Section 355 of the Code applies (i) in the two years before the date of this
Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a
"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) that includes the Transactions, and the Company was not
the subject of any such distribution pursuant to any transaction with respect
to which the Company has agreed to or is otherwise obligated to indemnify any
person for any Tax resulting from or attributable to such transaction.

  

  

  

(i) The Company is not and has not been during the applicable period specified
in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

  

  

  

(j) The Company is not a party to, or bound by, or has any obligation under,
any tax allocation or sharing agreement or similar contract or arrangement or
any agreement that obligates it to make any payment computed by reference to

(k) Schedule 2.10(k) sets forth all foreign jurisdictions in which the Company
is subject to Tax, are engaged in business or have a permanent establishment.
The Company has not entered into a gain recognition agreement pursuant to
Treas. Reg. § 1.367(a)-8. The Company has not transferred an intangible the

2.11 Compliance with Laws; Permits.

  

  

  

(a) The Company is not and has not been in violation of any Order binding upon
it, or of any federal, state, local or foreign Law, ordinance or regulation of
any governmental or regulatory body applicable to its Business or assets,
except for any such violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received any notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Entity of any such violation
or noncompliance, and there has been no citation, fine or penalty imposed or
asserted against the Company for any violation of such laws, regulations or
ordinances.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company has in full force and effect, and is in compliance with, all
licenses, permits and other approvals ("Permits") of any Governmental Entity
required for the conduct of the business of the Company as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have or so comply would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are described in Schedule 2.11 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and true and correct copies thereof have
previously been made available to the Buyer. No proceeding is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to revoke or limit any such Permit.

to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay any of the Transactions. To the Company's
Knowledge, there is no fact, event or circumstance that would be expected to

individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect.

Intellectual Property have been paid to the extent applicable, and all
necessary documents and certificates in connection with such Company Owned
Intellectual Property have been filed with the relevant authorities in the
United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes
of maintaining such Company Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no threatened or reasonably foreseeable loss or expiration
of any Company Intellectual Property.

  

  

(f) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.16(f)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the software owned or used by the Company incorporates,
includes, is distributed together with, was developed with or is compiled
with, linked with or otherwise dependent on any Open Source Materials, and
there are no current plans to include or use any Open Source Material in or
with the Company Products. Schedule 2.16(f)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule describes the license under which each of the Open Source Materials
is licensed to the Company; and with which the Company Product(s) the Open
Source Materials were used or distributed. The Company has complied with all
of the requirements of each license applicable to any Open Source Materials
used or distributed by it. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.16(f)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not provided (nor is it obligated
to provide, nor will the closing of the Transactions obligate the Company to
provide) the source code for any of its software to any other Person. The
Company has not, by license, transfer, escrow or otherwise, permitted any
other Person to reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any of its software
to create such source code, except as may be required by law. All copies of
any Company software distributed in connection with the Business have been
distributed solely in object code form. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.16(f)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no disclosure
of any Company software by the Company, or to the knowledge of the Company, by
any other Person, other than through licensing of object code versions. Each
copy so distributed by the Company was at the time of distribution, and to the
Knowledge of the Company is, the subject of a valid, existing and enforceable
license agreement.

  

  

(g) The Company has taken reasonable steps to protect its rights in, and the
confidentiality of, the Intellectual Property and all other confidential or
proprietary information belonging to the Company, developed by the Company, or
provided by any other Person to the Company. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company has, and enforces, a policy requiring each of its employees,
agents, consultants and contractors to execute enforceable proprietary
information, assignment of inventions and confidentiality agreements assigning
all rights in any Company Intellectual Property to the Company, copies of
which have been made available to the Buyer, and all current employees and
former employees and all agents, consultants and contractors of the Company,
have executed such an agreement. The Company has recorded all

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  assignments of any registered Intellectual Property assigned to the
Company with the relevant Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which such assignment is required
to be recorded. To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company is
obligated under any agreement or commitment, or subject to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that could interfere
with such employee's duties to the Company, or that could conflict with the
conduct of the Business.

 

  

  

(h) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.16(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Person has claimed or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has
reason to claim that any Person employed by or affiliated with the Company has
(i) violated or may be violating any of the terms or conditions of such
Person's employment, non-competition, non-disclosure or similar agreement with
such third Person; (ii) disclosed or may be disclosing or utilized or may be
utilizing any trade secret or proprietary information or documentation of such
third Person; or (iii) interfered or may be interfering in the employment
relationship between such third Person and any of its employees. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no Person employed by or affiliated with the Company
has used or proposes to use any trade secret or any information or
documentation proprietary to any other Person in connection with the Business
or any Company Products.

  

  

(i) The Company has taken all reasonable steps to protect its Intellectual
Property and its rights thereunder, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
such rights to Intellectual Property have been lost or are in jeopardy of
being lost through failure to act by the Company. The Company is not and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any licensing, distributorship
or other similar arrangement with the Company relating to Intellectual
Property is, in breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, its obligations under such arrangements. The Company has
implemented and maintained in effect reasonable security measures, consistent
with general industry practices, with respect to third-party source code or
other third party Intellectual Property. If the terms of any such licensing
arrangement require that customers of the Company enter into license or
sublicense agreements with the Company, then the Company has procured all such
licenses or sublicenses from its customers.

  

  

(j) The Company has the right to use, pursuant to valid licenses, all
software, development tools, library functions, compilers and all other
software and materials that are used to create, modify, compile, operate or
support any software that is Company Owned Intellectual Property or is
incorporated into any Company Product. The Company owns or has valid licenses
for, and possesses, all of the source code for all Company Products owned,
distributed or presently supported by the Company. The Company has written its
software in a way that such software may be understood in a commercially
reasonable manner by reasonably competent programmers certified in the
applicable programming languages. For the avoidance of doubt, the software
referred to in the preceding sentence shall include any and all bug tracking,
source code management and other information technology systems that have been
programmed, designed or otherwise developed in any way by or on behalf of the
Company.

  

  

(k) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.16(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has not (i) transferred ownership of, or entered into
any agreement under which it has, or may have, the obligation to transfer any
ownership of, or granted any exclusive license to use or distribute (or
entered into any agreement under which it has, or may have, the obligation to
grant any exclusive

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  license to use or distribute), or authorized the retention of any
exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of, any Company Intellectual
Property, to any other Person, (ii) permitted the rights of the Company in any
such Company Intellectual Property to lapse or enter the public domain, (iii)
entered into any agreement under which it has granted any covenant not to sue,
assert or exploit any such Company Intellectual Property, or (iv) entered into
any agreement under which it has granted any Person the right to bring a
lawsuit for infringement or misappropriation of any such Company Intellectual
Property. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions (alone or in combination with any other

2.17 Protection of Personal Information; Information Technology Systems.

  

  

(a) The Company has written privacy and security policies that govern its

borders) of Personal Information that satisfy applicable Laws and the Company
is in compliance with its privacy and security policies and applicable Laws
relating to Personal Information, including with respect to any Personal
Information collected by the Company or by any third party having authorized

the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not received written notice
of, or is not otherwise aware of, any complaints, breaches, non-permitted uses
or disclosures, or other incidents of alleged compromises to the privacy or
security of individually identifiable health information or other Personal
Information. As used in this Agreement, "HIPAA" means the Administrative
Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, including the Standards for Privacy of
Individually Identifiable Health Information (45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164,
Subparts A, D and E), the Transactions and Code Set Standards (45 CFR Part
162), and Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health

parties with access to its computer systems regarding use of its computer
systems, including use of the Internet and e-mail, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, such policy guidelines have been and are being complied with.
With respect to all Personal Information gathered or accessed in the course of
the operations of the Company, the Company has taken commercially reasonable
steps, consistent with industry standards and Laws, to protect such Personal
Information against loss and against unauthorized access, use, modification,
disclosure or other misuse.

  

  

(d) The Company has in place disaster recovery plans, procedures and
facilities that satisfy applicable Laws. The disaster recovery and security
plans, procedures and facilities specified meet all representations made to,
and obligations with, all customers, and the Company is in compliance in all
material respects therewith.

  

  

  

2.18 Title to Assets; Liens. The Company owns outright and has good title to,
or, in the case of leased properties and assets, has valid leasehold interests
in, all of its assets and properties, including, without limitation, all of
the assets and properties reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet and all other
assets and properties that are reasonably necessary for the conduct of its
Business (collectively, the "Company Assets"), free and clear of any Lien,
except for (a) assets and properties disposed of, or subject to purchase or
sales orders, in the ordinary course

respect with the documents and summary plan descriptions relating to such
Company Benefit Plan that have been delivered pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

  

  

  

(c) There is no entity (other than the Company) that together with the Company

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code either (i) has been determined to be so qualified by the
IRS and has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to that
effect, or (ii) with respect to any

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  Company Benefit Plan that is a standardized prototype plan, has been
determined to be so qualified by the IRS and has received a favorable opinion
letter from the IRS to that effect, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there
are no current circumstances that should result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter or opinion letter. Each Company Benefit Plan
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with the terms of
such plan and the provisions of any and all statutes, Orders or governmental
rules or regulations, including without limitation ERISA, the Code, or HIPAA,
whether as a matter of substantive Law or as necessary to secure favorable tax
treatment, and nothing has been done or not done with respect to any Company

each Company Benefit Plan, including without limitation Form 5500 series
annual reports/returns and PBGC Form 1s, have been timely filed. All
contributions, premiums and other amounts due to or in connection with each
Company Benefit Plan under the terms of the Company Benefit Plan or applicable
Law have been timely made, and provision has been made in the Interim Balance

the Interim Balance Sheet Date but were attributable to service before such
date.

Section 312 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. No Liability to the Pension

incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (other than insurance premiums
satisfied in due course).

  

  

  

(f) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
proceeding relating to any Company Benefit Plan and, except for routine

such proceeding. To the Knowledge of the Company, no fiduciary or any Person
who is a party in interest in respect of a Company Benefit Plan within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA has engaged in a transaction with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction
expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company to a material tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 409, 502(i) or
502(1) of ERISA or a material violation of Section 406 of ERISA. The
Transactions will not result in the assessment of a material tax or penalty
under Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA nor
result in a material violation of Section 406 of ERISA.

  

  

  

(g) All Company Benefit Plans providing welfare benefits are in compliance
with the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable laws,
including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical
Leave Act of 1993 and HIPAA, and such plans have been operated in compliance
with such laws and the written the Company Benefit Plan documents and all
required reports and descriptions of the Company Benefit Plans (including IRS
Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions
and Summaries of Material Modifications) have been (when required) timely
filed with the IRS, the Department of Labor or other governmental authority
and distributed as required, and all notices required by ERISA, the Code,
HIPAA or any other legal requirement required to be given by the Company with
respect to the Company Benefit Plans have been appropriately given.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) All claims for welfare benefits incurred by participants and beneficiaries
on or before the Closing Date are or will be fully covered by fully-funded or
paid-up third-party insurance policies or programs, and no insured arrangement
involves any retrospective premium, minimum premium, or similar arrangement
with any of the Company's insurers. Except for continuation of health coverage
to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA ("COBRA"), or applicable state and foreign laws, there are no
obligations under any Company Benefit Plan providing welfare benefits after
termination of employment.

  

  

  

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan can be amended, modified or terminated without
advance notice to or consent by any Employee or beneficiary, and without
liability for any payment or penalty. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate (i) has undertaken to maintain any Company Benefit Plan for any
period of time, or (ii) has announced its intention, or undertaken (whether or
not legally bound) to modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or adopt
any arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the
definition of Employee Benefit Plan.

  

  

  

(j) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained,
sponsored, contributed to, been required to contribute to, or incurred any
liability under any: (i) multi-employer plan as defined in Section 3(37) or
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (ii) multiple employer plan as defined in Section
413(c) of the Code, or any plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section
4063(a) of ERISA, (iii) welfare benefit fund within the meaning of Section
419(e) of the Code, or (iv) voluntary employees' beneficiary association,
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  

  

  

(k) Except as otherwise disclosed on Schedule 2.20(k) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Employee of, consultant to, or other provider of
services to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate will be entitled to any
additional benefit or the acceleration of the payment or vesting of any
benefit under any Company Benefit Plan by reason of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions.

  

  

  

(l) The Company is not a party to any contract or agreement, plan, or
arrangement, including without limitation this Agreement, that, individually
or collectively with other agreements, and taking into account any
transactions or payments contemplated by this Agreement, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to the payment to any Person of any amount that would
not be deductible by the Company by reason of Section 280G of the Code. The
Company has no obligation to make any reimbursement or other payment to any
such person with respect to any Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.

  

  

  

(m) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has no material Liability,
including under a Company Benefit Plan, arising out of the treatment of any
service provider as a consultant or independent contractor and not as an
Employee, or vice-versa.

  

  

  

(n) None of the Company Benefit Plans is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(o) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan for which a separate fund or
assets is or is required to be maintained, full and timely payment has been
made of all amounts required of the Company, under the terms of each such
Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law (as determined without regard to any
waiver of legally applicable funding requirements), as applied through the
Closing Date. The fair market value of the assets of each Company Benefit
Plan, as of the end of the most recently ended plan year of that Company
Benefit Plan, equals or exceeded the present value of all benefits Liabilities
under that Company Benefit Plan. None of the assets of any Company Benefit
Plan include any capital stock or other securities issued by the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate.

  

  

  

(p) The Company has maintained all Employee Benefit Plans required to be
maintained by applicable Law. With respect to each Foreign Plan: (i) such
Foreign Plan and the manner in which it has been administered satisfies all
applicable laws in all material respects, including providing all benefits
required by applicable Law, (iii) all contributions to such Foreign Plan
required through the Closing Date of this Agreement have been or will be made
by the Company, (iii) such Foreign Plan is either fully funded (or fully
insured) based upon generally accepted local actuarial and accounting
practices and procedures or adequate accruals for such Foreign Plan have been
made in the Company's financial statements, and (iv) the consummation of the
Transactions will not by themselves create or otherwise result in any
liability with respect to such Foreign Plan.

by applicable Law, and solely in their capacity as such (and not as a
Securityholder) (the "Company Indemnitees"), in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation or its
successor shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
successor to, fulfill and honor in all respects all such rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company in
favor of the Company Indemnitees described above in clause (i) of this Section
5.4(a).

  

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a fully prepaid "tail"
policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are currently covered by
the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and only for matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains coverage terms comparable to
those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company (the
"Company DandO Tail Policy"). The entire cost of the Company DandO Tail Policy,
including any and all premiums, expenses, fees and other costs, will be
treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer evidence of the amount of all such costs, including
a statement from the insurance carrier that such costs represent any and all
costs due or to become due in connection with such Company DandO Policy. If the
Merger is consummated, then the Buyer shall maintain the Company DandO Tail
Policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder, provided the obligations contained in this sentence shall not
require the Buyer to incur any expenses in connection therewith.

  

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnitees and their respective
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. No party to this
Agreement shall take any action as to materially and adversely affect any
Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.4 applies without the prior written
consent of such Company Indemnitee.

  

  

  

(e) In the event the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.5 Payment of Company Debt. At or immediately following the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to pay the Company
Debt Payoff Amount set forth on the Allocation Certificate to the applicable
third parties.

  

  

  

5.6 Employment and Benefits Arrangements.

  

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall enroll the Continuing Employees in the Buyer's employee benefit plans
(including any severance plans) for which such employees are eligible (the
"Buyer Plans"), providing for benefits that, in the Buyer's discretion, are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided by the Buyer
to its employees (excluding the Continuing Employees) who are generally
similarly situated to such Continuing Employees, and the Buyer shall, to the
extent permissible under such Buyer Plan, recognize the prior service with the
Company of each of the Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not benefit accruals) under the Buyer Plans. Each
applicable Buyer Plan shall waive, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and the relevant insurance carriers, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the relevant insurance carriers and to
the extent applicable in the plan year that contains the Closing Date and
subject to the reasonable cooperation of the applicable Continuing Employee,
the Continuing Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Buyer Plan
for amounts paid during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
under a corresponding benefit plan of the Company for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out of pocket maximums, as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer Plan.

  

  

  

(b) This Section 5.6 (i) is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer
any rights or remedies upon any Continuing Employee in their capacity as such,
to create any agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create
any third-party beneficiary hereto and (ii) shall not be construed to mean the
employment of any Continuing Employee is other than "at will" and not
terminable by the Buyer at any time.

  

  

  

5.7 Retention Bonus Amount. Subject to the terms set forth in Schedule 1.1(D),
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the Retention Bonus Amount.

  

  

  

SECTION 6

  

  

  

TAX COVENANTS

  

  

  

6.1 Consistent Tax Reporting. The Securityholders, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Buyer shall (a) treat and report the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in all respects consistently with the
provisions of this Agreement for purposes of any federal, state, local or
foreign Tax and (b) not take any actions or positions inconsistent with the
obligations of the parties set forth herein.

  

  

  

6.2 Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Securityholders'
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  all Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Taxable Periods") that have not been filed prior to
the Closing Date, including, without limitation, Form 4466 (if applicable),
and the Securityholders' Representative shall be permitted to amend any Tax
Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to carry-back any loss arising with
respect to the taxable period ending on the Closing Date. The Securityholders'
Representative shall permit the Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the prior sentence at least ten (10) days prior to filing
and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested
by the Buyer. The Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or extend the statute of limitations period in respect of any such Tax
Return without the written consent of the Securityholders' Representative,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. All Tax
Returns to be prepared by or for the Securityholders' Representative pursuant
to this Section 6.2 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Company, except as otherwise required by law, except that the
Tax Returns to be filed by the Securityholders' Representative shall request
refunds of all overpaid Tax amounts rather than applying such overpayments to
a subsequent taxable period. The Securityholders shall be responsible for all
Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods including, without
limitation, Taxes resulting from any Contest, and shall pay to (or as directed
by) the Company any Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods
except to the extent that such Taxes are taken into account in the final
determination of Net Working Capital. Such payments shall be made no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for paying such amount of
Taxes to the relevant tax authority.

 

  

  

  

6.3 Tax Periods That Include But Do Not End on the Closing Date. The Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the
Surviving Corporation for taxable periods that include but do not end on the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall permit the Securityholders' Representative to
review and comment on each such Tax Return at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by the Securityholders' Representative. The
Securityholders shall be responsible for all Taxes that relate to such Taxable
periods as determined under this Section 6.3, including, without limitation,
Taxes resulting from any Contest, and shall pay to (or as directed by) the
Surviving Corporation amounts equal to such Taxes and such payments shall be
made in each applicable case by no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the due date for paying such amount of Taxes to the relevant Tax authority.
For purposes of this Section 6.3, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on
a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the pre-
Closing period shall (a) in the case of any property Taxes and Taxes other
than Taxes based upon or related to income, payroll, sales or receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire taxable period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income, payroll, sales or receipts, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the
Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated on a basis consistent with the
allocations made pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Securityholders shall
not be required to pay any Taxes pursuant

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  to this Section 6.3 to the extent that such Taxes are taken into account
in the final determination of Net Working Capital.

 

  

  

  

6.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

  

(a) The Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Securityholders and the
Securityholders' Representative shall cooperate fully, to the extent
reasonably requested by the others, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to Sections 6.2 (Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing
Date) and 6.3 (Tax Periods That Include But Do Not End on the Closing Date) or
otherwise, and any audit, examination, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes (each, a "Contest") and will provide prompt written notice
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return filing or Contest and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  

  

  

(b) The Securityholders and the Securityholders' Representative agree that all
books and records in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company, the Surviving Corporation are the property of the Company and,
subsequent to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation. The
Securityholders shall deliver all such books and records to the Company prior
to Closing. After the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall make available
to the Securityholders' Representative such books and records to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Securityholders' Representative's filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to Section 6.2 (Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing
Date) or for any other reasonable purpose related to the Securityholders'
ownership of the Company prior to the Closing, provided, however, that in no
event will any Securityholder be entitled to information under this Section in
connection with any litigation or dispute among the parties.

  

  

  

(c) If requested by the Buyer, the Company, the Securityholders and the
Securityholders' Representative will cooperate with the Buyer to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed upon the Company or the Surviving Corporation (including, but not
limited to, with respect to the Transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

  

(d) The Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Securityholders and
the Securityholders' Representative further agree, upon request, to provide
the other parties with all information that any party may be required to
report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Department
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

  

6.5 Control of Audits. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in the next
sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall control the conduct, through counsel
of its own choosing, of any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability or
refund with respect to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.
In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates solely to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, the Securityholders' Representative shall control

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  the conduct of such Contest, using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, but the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
participate in such Contest at its own expense, and neither the
Securityholders nor the Securityholders' Representative shall settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that could affect the
Tax liability of the Surviving Corporation for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) after the Closing Date without the written consent of the Surviving
Corporation (not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that, if the
Securityholders' Representative declines to assume control of the conduct of
any such Contest within 15 days following the receipt by the Securityholders'
Representative of notice of such Contest, the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume control of such Contest and shall be entitled to settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Section 6.5 and the provisions of
Section 11.4 (Notice and Opportunity to Defend), the provisions of this
Section 6.5 shall control.

 

  

  

  

6.6 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains,
stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be shared equally by the Buyer and the Securityholders.
The Surviving Corporation will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, real
property gains, stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable law, the Buyer and the Securityholders will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Securityholders
shall pay their share of such Taxes to the Surviving Corporation when due.

  

  

  

6.7 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any refunds that are received by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation become entitled, that relate to a Pre-Closing
Period or that portion of a Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing
Date of the Company shall be for the account of the Securityholders, and Buyer
shall, to the extent the aggregate amount of such refunds or credits exceed
$50,000, pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit
(net of any Taxes of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation attributable to
such refund or credit) within five days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

  

  

  

6.8 Allocation of Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration (and
liabilities treated as assumed for Tax purposes and other capitalized costs)
shall be allocated among the assets of the Company and the covenants set forth
in Section 4.7 (Noncompetition) of this Agreement in accordance with Code
Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar
provision of applicable Law, as appropriate); provided that the Buyer shall
allocate no more than one percent (1%) of the Merger Consideration to the
covenants set forth in Section 4.7 (Noncompetition); provided, that the
parties agree that such allocation is solely for Tax purposes and is not
intended, and shall not in any manner be construed, to limit, diminish or
impair in any way the remedies that may be pursued by a Buyer Indemnitee,
including injunctive or monetary relief, in the event of a breach of a
covenant in Section 4.7 (Noncompetition). The parties and their respective
Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such
allocation.

(a) Representations. The representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered by or
on behalf of a party pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution

must deliver to the other party a written notice of Loss, claim or breach, and
following such delivery the notifying party shall be entitled to pursue its
available remedies with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of and
subject to the limitations in this Agreement regardless of the survival
periods set forth in this Section 11.1. It is the express intent of the
parties that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated by this Section

directly or indirectly, as a result of, with respect to or in connection with:

  

  

  

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company in
this Agreement or any certificate, document or other instrument delivered

indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee as a result of, with
respect to or in connection with any breach of or noncompliance with the
covenants contained in Section 4.5 (Nonsolicitation), 4.6 (Confidentiality;
Non-Disparagement), or 4.7 (Noncompetition) by such Founder.

  

  

(c) Individual Securityholders. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.5 (Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies) hereof, after
the Effective Time, as an integral term of the Merger, each Securityholder
shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any
Buyer Indemnitee as a result of, with respect to or in connection with any
breach of or noncompliance with the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in the such Securityholder's Letter of Transmittal by
such Securityholder.

  

  

  

11.3 Obligation of the Buyer to Indemnify. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 11.5 (Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies) hereof,
after the Effective Time, as an integral term of the Merger, the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders from and against any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by any Securityholder directly or indirectly, as a
result of, with respect to or in connection with any breach or violation of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Buyer, the
Merger Sub or, subsequent to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this Agreement.

  

  

  

11.4 Notice and Opportunity to Defend.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(a) A party or parties entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified
Party") with respect to a third party claim (a "Third-Party Claim") will give
the party or parties required to provide such indemnification (the
"Indemnifier") prompt written notice of any legal proceeding, claim or demand
instituted by any third party (in each case, a "Claim") in respect of which
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided that
the failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifier of its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnifier is actually and materially prejudiced by the
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such prompt notice.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifier provides written notice to the Indemnified Party
stating that the Indemnifier is responsible for the entire Claim within twenty
(20) days after the Indemnifier's receipt of written notice from the
Indemnified Party of such Claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right, at the
Indemnifier's expense, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Claim and to have the Indemnified Party represented by counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, selected by the Indemnifier;
provided, that (i) the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding
with counsel of its choice and at its expense, (ii) the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, at any time when the Buyer believes in good faith that any Claim
is having or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Buyer or the Business, or involves a Tax liability for a post-Closing
period, or relates to the IP Representations, may assume the defense and
otherwise deal with such Claim in good faith, with counsel of its choice,
(iii) the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, at any time when the Buyer believes
that a claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal matter, may assume the defense and otherwise deal with such Claim in
good faith with counsel of its choice, (iv) the Indemnifier may not assume the
defense of any Claim if a material conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party that precludes effective joint
representation or the amount of any claims exceeds or reasonably could exceed
the limitations set forth in Section 11.5(b), if applicable, and (v) the
Indemnified Party may take over the defense and prosecution of a Claim from
the Indemnifier if the Indemnifier has failed or is failing to diligently
prosecute or defend such Claim following the provision of written notice to
the Indemnifier of such failure and the failure of the Indemnifier to cure
such failure within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice; and provided
further, that the Indemnifier may not enter into a settlement of any Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless such settlement provides
the Indemnified Party with a full release from such Claim and requires no more
than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party has previously provided written notice to the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for the entire
Third Party Claim, neither the Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates may
settle or otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifier
may have a liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense or is otherwise
negotiating any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifier may participate in any
proceeding or negotiation with counsel of its choice and at its expense
subject to Schedule 11.2(a)(viii).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Any notice that a Buyer Indemnitee shall be required to give to the
Securityholders shall be satisfied by the delivery of notice by the Buyer
Indemnitee to the Securityholders' Representative, and the Securityholders'
Representative may respond to the Buyer Indemnitee on behalf of all
Securityholders.

  

  

  

11.5 Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies. The indemnification
provided by Section 11 (Indemnification) shall, except as provided in Section
11.5(h) (Fraud), be subject to the following limitations:

  

  

  

(a) Basket. No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i)
(other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation) or Section
11.2(a)(viii) unless the total amount of all indemnifiable Losses incurred by
the Buyer Indemnitees, including those subject to all previous claims, exceeds
$750,000 (the "Basket"), whereupon indemnification shall, except as set forth
on Schedule 11.2(a)(viii) be payable for the amount of such Losses without
deduction (and not merely the excess over the Basket).

  

  

  

(b) Cap. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 11.5, (i) each
Securityholder's aggregate liability for all claims for indemnification under
Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation
and a IP Representation) shall not exceed their respective Pro Rata Share of
the Escrow Amount, (ii) each Securityholder's aggregate liability for all
claims for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i) with respect to any
inaccuracy or breach of an IP Representation and under Section 11.2(a)(viii)
shall not exceed their respective Pro Rata Share of the IP Indemnity Cap, and
(iii) and in no event may the liability of a Securityholder for Losses
indemnifiable under any other subsection of Section 11.2(a) exceed the Merger
Consideration actually received by the Securityholder, including deemed
receipt of the applicable amount of the Escrow Amount.

  

  

  

(c) Escrow Amount. All claims for indemnification under Section 11.2
(Obligations of the Securityholders to Indemnify) shall be satisfied first
from the Escrow Amount to the full extent thereof. For clarity, indemnifiable
Losses under Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a Fundamental
Representation or IP Representation) shall be satisfied solely out of the
Escrow Account and recovery against the Escrow Amount constitutes the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees for any and all such Losses.

  

  

  

(d) Set-off. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11.5, if at
any time there shall be an outstanding Claim that exceeds the Escrow Amount
then available, the Buyer shall have the right to withhold from, reduce, set-
off against and retain from any required payments of Earn-Out Consideration,
at the Buyer's sole discretion, the good faith estimate of any indemnification
to which a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled hereunder; provided that if the final
amount of Losses for such Claim is less than the amount by which the portion
of the Earn-Out Consideration was withheld, reduced, set-off or retained, then
the Buyer shall make payment of such difference in accordance with Section 1.8
(Earn-Out); provided further, however, the Buyer shall not set off any Losses
(but may withhold any such payment) for which it may be entitled until such
Claim has been finally resolved in accordance with this Section 11.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Reduction for Insurance. The amount of any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under this Section 11 shall be reduced by the amount by which
(a) any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party relating to such
Loss exceeds (b) the amount of expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
procuring such insurance recovery, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses and any increased premiums or costs as a result of such claim for
which insurance proceeds are received.

  

  

  

(f) Mitigation. Each party shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the Losses that any such party reasonably expects will result from
such event or circumstance and for which it may seek indemnification (it being
understood that nothing herein shall limit the right to seek indemnification
hereunder with respect to any costs of such mitigation) upon becoming aware of
any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
provided that the Indemnifier shall not be required to materially alter its
conduct in connection therewith. Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve
either party of any common Law or other duty to mitigate any loss, liability
or damage suffered by it.

  

  

  

(g) Sole Remedy. Subject to Section 11.5(h) (Fraud), the sole and exclusive
remedy for money damages for any matter arising under this Agreement shall be
the rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement. To the extent that
a portion of any indemnifiable Loss is specifically included as a liability in
the calculation of Net Working Capital, then the amount specifically included
as a liability will be subtracted from the total indemnifiable Losses payable
in respect of such indemnifiable Loss. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss to the
extent such Loss consists of liabilities that were included in the
determination of Net Working Capital.

  

  

  

(h) Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
survival periods, limitations, thresholds and other provisions set forth in
this Section 11 (Indemnification) shall not apply with respect to (i) fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful breach or willful misconduct, (ii)
any claim against a Securityholder with respect to a breach or violation of a
representation or warranty that was actually known to the Company's Knowledge
to be inaccurate as of the date hereof, or (iii) any equitable remedy,
including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance;
provided, that no claim of fraud may be brought pursuant to this Agreement
subsequent to five (5) years after the Closing Date and any other claim with
respect to the matters in clauses (i) or (ii) above brought subsequent to the
five (5) years after the Closing shall be subject to the survival periods,
limitations, thresholds and other provisions set forth in this Section 11
(Indemnification); provided, however, that in no event may the liability of a
Securityholder in respect of all such claims brought pursuant to this
Agreement exceed the Merger Consideration actually received by the
Securityholder, including deemed receipt of the applicable amount of the
Escrow Amount.

  

  

  

(i) Limitation of Liabilities. UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE ACTUALLY PAID TO A
THIRD PARTY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION 11 IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD
PARTY CLAIM, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY OR OTHER PERSON
FOR (I) ANY SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS AND
OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND OR (II) PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  SUCH PARTY WILL BE ADVISED, WILL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT
WILL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING.

 

  

  

  

SECTION 12

  

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

  

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other Transactions abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, regardless
of any approval by Stockholders as follows and in no other manner:

  

  

  

(a) by written agreement of the Company and the Buyer;

  

  

  

(b) by the Buyer, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under
this Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 9.1 (Compliance; CEO Certificate) would not be
satisfied, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to the
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the Buyer gives
the Company written notice identifying such breach, failure or
misrepresentation;

  

  

  

(c) by the Company, if the Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under
this Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Buyer
set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 10.1 (Compliance; Officer Certificates) would
not be satisfied, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured
to the Company's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the
Company gives the Buyer written notice identifying such breach, failure or
misrepresentation;

  

  

  

(d) by the Buyer, if the conditions set forth in Section 9 (Conditions to the
Obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub To Close) become incapable of satisfaction;

  

  

  

(e) by the Company, if the conditions set forth in Section 10 (Conditions to
Company's Obligation To Close) become incapable of satisfaction;

  

  

  

(f) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 2013, which date may be extended by mutual agreement
of the Company and the Buyer (the "Closing Deadline"); provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.1(f) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before the Closing Deadline;

  

  

  

(g) by either the Buyer or the Company if any court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or ruling or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and
such Order or ruling shall have become final and nonappealable;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) by the Buyer, by written notice given at any time before the Closing
Deadline, if the Stockholder Approval has not been obtained within three (3)
Business Days after the date hereof.

  

  

  

12.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 12.1 (Termination), it shall forthwith be void and have no effect,
without liability or obligation as a result of such termination on the part of
any party, its directors, officers or stockholders, except that the
Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 12.2, and Section 13 (Miscellaneous)
shall survive termination; provided, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall relieve any Person from liability for any material breach of this
Agreement occurring before such termination; provided, further, that if the
Agreement is terminated subsequent to breach of Section 4.5 (Nonsolicitation),
the Company shall, in addition to any other amounts owed by Company hereunder,
be obligated to make a payment of $2,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") in
immediately available funds to Buyer within five Business Days of termination
of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 12.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that without these agreements Buyer would not have entered
into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
12.2 do not constitute a penalty.

13.2 Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver.

  

  

  

(a) This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto), the
Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the Transactions, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, with respect
thereto, including the Letter of Intent, dated October 16, 2013, other than

(b) This Agreement may be amended at any time, notwithstanding the adoption
hereof by the Stockholders but subject to the limitations of Section 251(d) of
the DGCL, only by an instrument signed by each party hereto. Any provision
hereof may be waived only by an instrument signed by each party benefited by
such provision.

  

  

  

(c) This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto), and the

  

  

  

Ancillary Agreements are not intended to confer upon any person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective
Time, in Section 5.4 (Director and Officer Indemnification) or Section 11
(Indemnification).

  

  

  

(d) No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that the Buyer may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates, so long as the Buyer remains
ultimately liable for all of the Buyer's obligations hereunder.

  

  

  

13.3 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof, as to all matters,
including matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

  

  

  

(b) The parties (i) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the
jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement, (ii) agree not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of or based upon this Agreement except in the state courts of
Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and
(iii) hereby waive, and agree not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit,
action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court.

  

  

  

(c) Each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury in
connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Transactions.

  

  

  

13.4 No Prejudice. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of the Company and the Founders, and the rights and remedies that may be
exercised by the Buyer Indemnitee based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements, will not be limited or affected by any investigation
conducted by the Buyer or the Merger Sub or any agent thereof with respect to,
or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by the Buyer or the
Merger Sub or any agent thereof at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  with or performance of any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, and no Buyer Indemnitee shall be required to show that it relied
on any (and each Buyer Indemnitee shall be deemed to have relied on each) such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company in order to be
entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto. The waiver by the Buyer or the
Merger Sub of any of the conditions set forth in Sections 8 (Conditions to
Each Party's Obligation to Close) or 9 (Conditions to the Obligation of Buyer
and Merger Sub to Close) will not affect or limit the provisions of Section 11
(Indemnification).

 

  

  

  

13.5 Specific Performance and Other Remedies. Each party hereby acknowledges
that the rights of each party to consummate the Transactions and the covenants
of the parties are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, in
the event that any party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant
or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching party may be without an
adequate remedy at Law. In the event that any party violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such party herein, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to the exercise of other
remedies, to seek and (subject to court approval) obtain injunctive and other
equitable relief, without necessity of posting a bond, restraining such party
from committing such breach or threatened breach.

  

  

  

13.6 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and legal
representatives

  

  

  

13.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
separate counterparts, including by facsimile or pdf transmission, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

  

13.8 Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule) are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth
herein. All references herein to Sections, subsections, clauses, exhibits and
schedules shall be deemed references to such parts of this Agreement, unless
the context shall otherwise require.

  

  

  

13.9 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only, and
shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

  

13.10 Expenses. Except as set forth herein, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions, including all legal, accounting, tax and
financial advisory, consulting, investment banking and all other fees and
expenses of third parties shall be the obligation of the party incurring such
fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any action, claim or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements or the
enforcement of any provision thereof is brought against any party, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled.

 

  

  

  

13.11 Severability. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the
commission of any act contrary to Law. Should there be any conflict between
any provisions hereof and any present or future statute, Law, ordinance,
regulation, or other pronouncement having the force of Law, the latter shall
prevail, but the provision of this Agreement affected thereby shall be
curtailed and limited to the extent necessary to bring it into compliance
therewith, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.

  

  

  

13.12 No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and
documents contemplated herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement or documents contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other
agreements or documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring any of the provisions of this
Agreement or any other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

  

  

  

13.13 Securityholders' Representative.

  

  

  

(a) Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the Stockholder
Approval, and without the requirement of further action on the part of any
Securityholder, each Securityholder shall be deemed to, and shall, have
consented to the appointment of Safeguard Delaware, Inc. as the
Securityholders' Representative, as the agent and attorney-in-fact for and on
behalf of the Securityholders other than the Dissenting Stockholders, if any
(the "Securityholders' Representative"). The Securityholders' Representative
shall, on behalf of the Securityholders:

  

  

  

(i) take all action permitted in connection with the implementation of those
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement that require or permit
action by the Securityholders' Representative,

  

  

  

(ii) take all action permitted in connection with the defense and/or
settlement of any and all claims for which the Securityholders may be required
to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 11 (Indemnification) hereof
(including rejecting, contesting, negotiating, settling and resolving any such
claims) and any claims that may be made against the Escrow Amount,

  

  

  

(iii) comply with Orders of courts and determinations and awards of
arbitrators with respect to claims,

  

  

  

(iv) review and take action with respect to Tax Returns,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) give and receive all notices and service of process required or permitted
to be given or received by the Securityholders or the Securityholders'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,

  

  

  

(vi) execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement that the Securityholders' Representative deemed necessary or
appropriate, whether prior to, at or after the Closing, and

  

  

  

(vii) take any and all such additional action as is contemplated to be taken
by or on behalf of the Securityholders by the terms of this Agreement or of
the Escrow Agreement or as may be necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Securityholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

  

  

  

(b) All notices provided to and/or legal process served upon the
Securityholders' Representative in accordance with this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to be provided to and/or served upon the
Securityholders and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders.
All decisions, actions, agreements, and instructions by the Securityholders'
Representative, including any consent, waiver, or agreement between the
Securityholders' Representative and any Buyer Indemnitee relating to the
defense or settlement of any claim for which the Securityholders may be
required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 11 (Indemnification)
hereof, shall be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders; and the
Buyer, each other Buyer Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely conclusively thereon. The Buyer, each other Buyer Indemnitee and the
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to inquire into the authority of any person
reasonably believed to be the Securityholders' Representative and no
responsibility or liability for any action or omission thereof, and no party
shall have any cause of action against the Buyer, any other Buyer Indemnitee
or the Escrow Agent for any action or omission by such party in reliance upon
the instructions or decisions of any person reasonably believed to be the
Securityholders' Representative.

  

  

  

(c) In the event that more than one Person shall at any time serve
collectively as the Securityholders' Representative, decisions of such Persons
shall, as between them and with respect to the rights of the Securityholders
in relation to the Securityholders' Representative, be made by majority vote;
provided, however, that they shall designate a single Person as
"Securityholders' Representative" for all purposes involving the Buyer, any
other Buyer Indemnitee, or the Escrow Agent.

  

  

  

(d) The Securityholders' Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Securityholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
Securityholders. In taking any actions as Securityholders' Representative, the
Securityholders' Representative may rely conclusively, without any further
inquiry or investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or
written, given by any person he or it reasonably believes to be authorized
thereunto. The Securityholders' Representative may, in all questions arising
hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the Securityholders'
Representative shall not be liable to any Securityholder for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Securityholders' Representative based
on such advice. The Securityholders' Representative undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement
and/or

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  the Escrow Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement against the Securityholders'
Representative.

 

  

  

  

(e) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Payment Agent to wire to
the Securityholders' Representative the Expense Fund, which will be held by
the Securityholders' Representative as agent and for the benefit of the
Securityholders and will be used for the purposes of paying any professional
fees and expenses of any attorney, accountant or other advisors retained by
the Securityholders' Representative and other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in connection with
the performance of the Securityholders' Representative's duties under this
Agreement ("Representative Expenses"). The Securityholders acknowledge that
the Securityholders' Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice. The Securityholders' Representative
shall not have any liability to any Securityholder for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by him or it as Securityholders' Representative without
gross negligence. The Securityholders shall, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify, defend and hold the Securityholders'
Representative harmless from and against any loss, damage, Tax, Liability and
expense that may be incurred or paid by the Securityholders' Representative
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
or its duties (except as caused by the Securityholders' Representative's gross
negligence), including the legal costs and expenses of defending the
Securityholders' Representative against any claim or Liability in connection
with the performance of his or its duties, to the extent such losses, damages,
Taxes, Liabilities and expenses exceed the Expense Fund. The Securityholders
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund. The
Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to recover from the
Securityholders any Representative Expenses reasonably incurred by the
Securityholders' Representative in connection with actions taken by the
Securityholders' Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, without the requirement of any consent or approval by Buyer
or any other Person. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to
the Securityholders' Representative under this Agreement shall survive the
Merger or any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) If not paid directly to the Securityholders' Representative by the
Securityholders, the Representative Expenses shall be satisfied (i) from the
Expense Fund, (ii) to the extent the amount of the Representative Expenses
exceeds the amounts then available in the Expense Fund, from any amounts
payable to the Securityholders from the Escrow Amount and the Earn-Out
Consideration solely to the extent the Securityholders would otherwise then be
paid such amounts from the Escrow Amount or the Earn-Out Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (as
applicable) and (iii) to the extent the amount of the Representative Expenses
exceeds amounts immediately available to the Securityholders' Representative
under (i) and (ii), from each Securityholder, severally and not jointly and in
proportion to its Pro Rata Share; provided, that while this section allows the
Securityholders' Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund, the Escrow
Amount and the Earn-Out Consideration, this does not relieve the
Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Securityholders' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(g) The Securityholders' Representative shall have the power to designate his
or its successor hereunder. In the event that the Securityholders'
Representative resigns from such position or is unable to continue in such
position without having designated a successor, Securityholders holding among
them the rights to receive at least a majority of the amount then remaining in
the Escrow Amount to be distributed to the Securityholders (or, if no Escrow
Amount remains, representing a majority in interest of the Pro Rata Shares)
(the "Majority Holders") shall promptly appoint another representative to fill
such vacancy, and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the
Securityholders' Representative for all purposes of this Agreement; provided
that a resigning Securityholders' Representative shall continue to perform his
or its duties and obligations until his or its successor is appointed and has
become a party to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the absence of
such appointment, the Securityholders' Representative or the Buyer may apply
to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Securityholders' Representative, and the costs, expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such proceeding shall be paid from
the Expense Fund or, to the extent exhausted, the Securityholders. The
Securityholders' Representative may be removed at any time upon the written
consent of the Majority Holders with not less than thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to the Buyer; provided however, that a successor
Securityholders' Representative must be concurrently appointed and become a
party to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

  

(h) The provisions of this Section 13.13 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Securityholder may have in
connection with the Transactions. Remedies available at Law for any breach of
the provisions of this Section 13.13 will be inadequate; therefore, the Buyer
and each other Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages or posting any bond
if such person brings an action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of
this Section 13.13.

  

  

  

13.14 Waiver of Conflict of Interest. If the Securityholder Representative so
desires, acting on behalf of the Securityholders and without the need for
additional consent or waiver by the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, Morgan,
Lewis and Bockius LLP shall be permitted to represent the Securityholder
Representative after the Closing with respect to any matters related to this
Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto.
