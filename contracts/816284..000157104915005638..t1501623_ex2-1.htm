extension period of ten (10) Business Days (or any longer period as may be
approved in advance by the Company), it being understood and agreed that
Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this
clause (C) on more than two (2) occasions, but may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to do so;

  

 _ _

--- 

 


--- 

    

 _ _

  

 _provided, however_ , that the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this

otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_.

manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of 
_Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

(iv) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw
the Offer prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer without
the prior written consent of the Company or unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Acquisition Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one
(1) Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the

Company Shares that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition
Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that
Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer;

Acquisition Sub shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares if,
as a result, Acquisition Sub would acquire less than the number of Company
Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Price
payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash,
subject to reduction for any withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof

this _Section 2.1(f)_, Acquisition Sub may (but shall not be required to),
and the Offer to Purchase shall reserve the right to, provide for a
"subsequent offering period" (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated

Business Days immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay
for, all Company Shares that are validly tendered during the "subsequent
offering period" promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated

during the "subsequent offering period." Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub
on a timely basis the funds necessary to

  



    

-18- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

pay for any Company Shares that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase
during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Price payable in respect
of each Company Share that is validly tendered during the "subsequent offering

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, subject
to the provisions of _Section 7.9(a)_, the certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read in the form

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following
shall occur:

  



  

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
each Company Restricted Share, but excluding (A) Cancelled Company Shares,
(B) Accepted Company Shares and (C) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon,
upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_ (or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in
the manner provided in _Section 3.10_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within
three (3) Business Days after the Closing, with respect to each Company
Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving
Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the
holders of such Company Restricted Shares, the applicable Merger Consideration
(such consideration, in the aggregate, the " _Restricted Share Consideration_
"), less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof, as
promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regular payroll
date) thereafter.

  



  

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock (A) owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company, in each case immediately prior to the commencement of the Offer ("
_Cancelled Company Shares_ "), or (B) irrevocably accepted for purchase
pursuant to the Offer (" _Accepted Company Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or further consideration paid
therefor.

  



  

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such

  



    

-24- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

shares of common stock of Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Subject to the terms
of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, all Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7(a)_, but instead will be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company
Shares, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be
considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section
3.8_.

  



  

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company
in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares.

  



  

(d) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Option, whether vested or unvested or exercisable or
unexercisable under the Company Stock Plans, shall, automatically and without
any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into only the right to receive (without interest), an amount in cash
(such consideration, in the aggregate, the " _Option Consideration_ "), less
applicable Tax withholdings, equal to (i) for each Company Option that is
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of (1) the Offer Price over (2) the exercise price per share
of

  



    

-25- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

such Company Option, and (B) the number of Company Shares underlying such
Company Option, payable in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable
(but no later than the first payroll period) after the Effective Time and
(ii) for each Company Option that is not vested as of the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the
Offer Price over (2) the exercise price per share of such Company Option, and
(B) the number of Company Shares underlying such Company Option, payable no
later than the second payroll period after the applicable vesting date of
such former Company Option, _provided_ that such cash amount shall remain
subject to the same vesting schedule as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time with respect to the unvested former Company Option, and the
holder of such former Company Option must remain in service to Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
through the applicable vesting date to receive payment in respect thereof;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (w) to the extent such cash amount remains
unvested as of December 31, 2015 (the " _Anniversary Date_ ") and such holder
remains in service with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates, such amount shall vest on the Anniversary
Date, and shall be paid no later than the Anniversary Date or (x) shall vest
in full earlier if the former Company Option holder's service to Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
terminates without Cause (as defined below), for Good Reason (as defined
below) or due to such holder's death or disability, in any case, prior to the
Anniversary Date, in which case payment of the then-unvested cash amounts
herein shall be made by no later than the second payroll period after the date
of such termination of employment. The foregoing payment shall be determined
and interpreted in a manner intended to be exempt from Section 409A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (y) any unvested Company Option held by an
individual who is a non-employee member of the Company Board at the Effective
Time shall become vested and exercisable in full upon the Effective Time and
will be treated in accordance with _Section 3.7(d)(i)_ and (z) in the event
the Effective Time occurs after the Anniversary Date, any unvested Company
Option shall become vested and exercisable in full upon the Effective Time
and will be treated in accordance with _Section 3.7(d)(i)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the exercise price per share of any Company Option, whether
vested or unvested or exercisable or unexercisable as of the Effective Time,
is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, then by virtue of the occurrence
of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holders
thereof, the Company Option will automatically terminate and be canceled
without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof. "Cause" and "Good
Reason" shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms (or similar
terms, such as "Constructive Termination") in the applicable Company Option
holder's employment agreement with the Company or, if there is no
employment agreement or such employment agreement does not define such terms,
"Cause" and "Good Reason" shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Company's Change in Control Severance Plan as in effect
immediately before the date hereof.

  



  

(e) _Company RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into only the right to receive (without interest), an
amount in cash (such consideration, in the aggregate, the " _RSU
Consideration_ "), less applicable Tax withholdings, payable as soon as
reasonably practicable

  



    

-26- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(but no later than the first payroll period) after the later of the Effective
Time or the date such former Company RSU Award (or the relevant
portion thereof) vests, equal to the product of (A) the Offer Price, and (B)
the number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that any such RSU Consideration shall
remain subject to the same vesting schedule as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time with respect to the former Company RSU Award and the
holder of such former Company RSU Award must remain in service to Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
through the applicable vesting date to receive payment in respect thereof;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (w) to the extent such cash amount remains
unvested as of the Anniversary Date, such cash amount shall vest on the
Anniversary Date and shall be paid no later than the Anniversary Date or (x)
such cash amount shall vest in full earlier if the former Company RSU
holder's service to Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates terminates without Cause, for Good Reason, death
or disability, in any case, prior to the Anniversary Date in which case
payment of the amounts herein shall be made by no later than the second
payroll period after the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (y) any unvested Company RSU Award held by an individual who is a
non-employee member of the Company Board at the Effective Time shall become
vested in full upon the Effective Time and the RSU Consideration will be paid
in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the first
payroll period) after the Effective Time and (z) in the event the Effective
Time occurs after the Anniversary Date, any unvested Company RSU Award shall
become vested in full upon the Effective Time and the RSU Consideration will
be paid in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the
first payroll period) after the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) _Additional Actions_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any authorized committee) shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to effectuate all
of the actions contemplated by this _Section 3.7_ , contingent on the Closing
of the Merger.

  



  

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
the payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders
of Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, an
amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock are entitled under this _Article III_ (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Option Consideration, RSU
Consideration or Restricted Share Consideration). Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall
be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or obligations of an agency of the

  



    

-27- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment or losses thereon shall
affect the consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
under this _Article III _and to the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the amount required to promptly pay in full
the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article III_, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such payments contemplated by
this  _Article III_.

  



  

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to
each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and in
each case other than holders of Company Restricted Shares) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii)
uncertificated Company Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each
case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificate that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_ ), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of Company Shares represented by such holder's transferred
Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to _Section
3.8(e))_ , and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this  _Section
3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

  



  

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law. To
the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a
holder of Company Shares in respect of any amounts that would otherwise have
been payable in respect of any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts earned with
respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine (9)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Company Shares that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Company Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

  



  

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From
and after the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any Company Shares shall, subject to _Section 3.7(c)(i)_ , cease
to have

  



    

-29- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III _shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company
Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

  



  

3.10 _ _ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and the
posting by such holders of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon
such terms as may reasonably be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

  



  

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company and Acquisition Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and
Acquisition Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

  



  

Article IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), or (ii) as
disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2014 (the " _Company Form 10-K_ ") and in any Company SEC
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company since January 1,
2015 and publicly disseminated via the SEC's EDGAR service prior to the date
hereof (other than in any "risk factor" disclosure or any other forward-
looking, cautionary or predictive statements set forth therein and provided

4.3_ ), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition
Sub as follows:

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

  



  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized and
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are
recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation, with all corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and conduct its business as currently conducted, except
in the case of the Company's Subsidiaries for such failures to be in good
standing or have such power that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in
which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the
nature or conduct of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified and in
good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or similar governing documents) as currently in effect for the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar governing documents).
_Section 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, the authorized and
outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company and
the jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary of the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any
interest in any Person other than the Company's Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.2 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of
Company Preferred Stock. At the close of business on July 13, 2015 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 31,604,369 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding (including 113,603 Company Restricted Shares); (ii) no
shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding; (iii) no
shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury; (iv)
an aggregate of 1,077,208 shares of Company Common Stock remained available
for issuance under the Company Stock Plans, excluding shares
underlying outstanding awards, and (v) under the Company Stock Plans, there
were outstanding Company Options to purchase 2,007,379 shares of Company
Common Stock and outstanding Company RSU Awards with respect to 376,612 shares
of Company Common Stock. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, at
the close of business on the Capitalization Date, no Company Securities or
other voting securities of or equity interests in the Company were issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding. From the Capitalization Date until
and including the date hereof, the Company has not issued any shares of its
capital stock, has not granted any options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, stock appreciation rights, warrants or rights or entered into any
other agreements or commitments to issue any shares of its capital stock, or
granted any other awards in respect of any shares of its capital stock and has
not split, combined or reclassified any of its shares of capital stock. No
purchase or other rights have been granted or are otherwise outstanding under

Employee Stock Purchase Plan, adopted by the Company effective as of
immediately prior to the closing of the Company's initial public offering.

  



  

(b) _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
true, correct and complete list, as of the date hereof, of the name of each
holder of Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company RSU Awards,
the number of outstanding Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and
Company RSU Awards held by such holder, the grant date of each such Company
Option, Company Restricted Share and Company RSU Award, the number of Company
Shares such holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of each Company
Option and the corresponding exercise price, the expiration date of each
Company Option, the vesting schedule of each such Company Option, Company
Restricted Share and Company RSU Award and the Company Stock Plan pursuant to
which each such Company Option, Company Restricted Share or Company RSU Award
was granted. Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, each Company Option, Company Restricted Share and Company RSU Award
grant was made in accordance in all material respects with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan and applicable Law. No Company Option (i) has an
exercise price that has been or may be less than the fair market value of the
underlying equity as of the date such Company Option was granted or (ii)
has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of
recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition of such
Company Option.

of, or other ownership interests in, the Company (the items in _clauses (A)_
,  _(B)_ , _(C)_ and _(D)_ , together with the Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Company Restricted Shares, Company Options and Company RSU
Awards, being referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ ") or (E)

agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock of the Company. All
outstanding securities of the Company have been duly authorized, offered and

Laws, including the

securities or other ownership interests in) any Subsidiary of the Company,
(iii) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or

-35- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

controls and procedures are designed to ensure that (i) material information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries is made known to the
Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and
(ii) all such information is communicated in a timely fashion to the
Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
allow for timely decisions regarding the disclosure of such information by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(f) The Company has not extended or maintained credit, arranged for

Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company.

6.1(c)_ , (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (m), (o), (p), (t) or (u) (but only
with respect to any of the foregoing actions), in each case, except for the
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

or on behalf of the Company or any of its directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents or other representatives for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

business association or other business organization or enter into any new
line of business;

  



  

(p) enter into any Contract or transaction between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, other than in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and on terms no less favorable to
the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, than the terms governing such
transactions with third parties;

  



  

(q) waive, release or assign any material rights or claims or make
any material payment, directly or indirectly, of any Liability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries before the same comes due in accordance with its

practice;

  



  

(r) amend or modify the compensation terms or any other obligations

Financial Advisor in a manner adverse to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or Parent or engage other financial advisers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(s) enter into, amend or cancel any insurance policies other than in

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over their own business and
operations.

6.2 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and Acquisition Sub)
conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.2(c)_, at all times during the period
commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the
Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective officers, directors or employees shall, and the Company shall
instruct its and its Subsidiaries' other representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) whether publicly or otherwise, solicit, initiate, induce,
cause, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to
facilitate or assist, any proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or offer
that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or
any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person
(other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition
Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to encourage, induce,

be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) conduct, participate,
maintain or engage in, or continue to conduct, participate, maintain or
engage in, any discussions or negotiations with any Person, or take any
action, with respect to any proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or

Acquisition Proposal ( _provided, however_ , nothing contained herein shall
prohibit the Company or any of its representatives from informing any third
party of the provisions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ or contacting the
Person (or the representatives of such Person) that made any Acquisition
Proposal solely for the purpose of seeking clarification of solely those terms
or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal that require clarification so as
to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal), (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to
_Section 7.4(b)_ ), (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or similar document, or any Contract or
commitment contemplating or otherwise providing for or relating to an
Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (vi) take any action to make
the provisions of any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
(including the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL), or any anti-
takeover provision in the Company's organizational documents, inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, (vii) amend or grant
any waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar
Contract with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (viii) propose or agree to any of the foregoing. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof but in any
event within two (2) Business Days, request of each Person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal to

  



    

-57- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

promptly return all confidential information furnished prior to the execution
of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives. From and after the date
of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors and employees shall use their reasonable best efforts to
enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a beneficiary.

  



  

(c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours, following the receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective representatives of (x) an Acquisition Proposal, (y)
any request for nonpublic information, to engage in negotiations or
discussions regarding, or any other inquiry that would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (z) any request for a waiver or
release under any standstill or similar Contract, the Company shall provide
Parent with oral and written notice of (i) the receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any financing
arrangements), and (iii) the identity of the Person or group (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided by such
Person or group in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry ( _provided _ that the Company may redact, and not disclose, the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal
if disclosure of such identity would violate the terms of a Contract by which
the Company is bound as of the date hereof). The Company shall keep Parent
informed as promptly as practicable with respect to the status and details of
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours following any changes to such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry), including by providing copies of all written materials
received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives relating to such Acquisition Proposal after written notice of
such Acquisition Proposal is delivered to Parent pursuant to this  _Section
6.2(c)_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 6.2(c)_
, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may request clarifications from,
waive provisions of a standstill or similar Contract applicable to, enter
into or participate in discussions or negotiations with or furnish information
to, any Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
(or its representatives) in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, in
each case made after the date of this Agreement and under circumstances not
otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, if (A) such action is taken
subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall, prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the provision of any non-public information
of the Company to any such Person, provide such information to Parent
(including by posting such information to the Data Room), to the extent such
information has not previously been provided or made available to Parent.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by
any representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute
a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.2_. 

  



  

Article VII 
 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

  



  

7.1 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the
Offer set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Annex A_ to be satisfied and cause
the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied;
(ii) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities and any
other Person and make all necessary registrations,
declarations, notifications and filings with Governmental Authorities or any
other Person, that are necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger; and
(iii) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals
under any Material Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company shall not be required prior to the Effective Time to
pay any consent or other similar fee, "profit-sharing" or other similar
payment or other consideration (including increased rent or other similar
payments or any amendments, supplements or other modifications to (or waivers
of) the existing terms of any Contract), or the provision of additional
security (including a guaranty) or otherwise assume or agree to assume any
Liability that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, to
obtain any consent, waiver or approval of any Person (including any
Governmental Authority) under any Contract.

  



  

(b) Both Parent and the Company agree, on behalf of themselves and
their respective Affiliates, that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Company shall, and neither Parent nor
the Company shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into any definitive
agreements or arrangements for, or consummate, an acquisition (via stock
purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) of any
ownership interest or assets of any Person if such ownership interest or
assets would reasonably be expected to result in any delay in obtaining, or
to result in the failure to obtain, any regulatory approvals required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger),
or would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Merger.

7.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a
Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby as required by the HSR Act as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement but in no event later than fifteen (15) days
following the date of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii)
supply the other with any information and documentary material that may be
required in order to make such filings, (iii) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC or the
DOJ, and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger under any Antitrust Laws. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent will not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be
required to (i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, conduct of business restrictions, or a sale
or disposition of assets or businesses or a license or grant of
commercialization rights to businesses, products, product lines, fields of
use or assets of Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), or (ii) contest or resist any
Legal Proceeding or seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order that may result from such Legal Proceedings, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to take
any of the actions described in the foregoing subclause (ii), and, if
Parent elects to take any such action, the Company shall reasonably cooperate
with Parent in connection therewith.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall promptly inform the other of any communication from any
Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in connection with any filings or investigations with, by or before
any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceedings initiated by a private party.
If any party hereto or an Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to which any such filings have been
made, then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause
to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such
request. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent
reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by
the applicable Governmental Authority, the parties hereto agree to (i) give
each other reasonable advance notice

  



    

-60- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

of all meetings and conference calls with any Governmental Authority relating
to the Offer or the Merger, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings and conference calls, (iii) keep the
other party reasonably apprised with respect to any oral communications with
any Governmental Authority regarding the Offer or the Merger, (iv) cooperate
in the filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions or other written communications explaining or defending the Offer and
the Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument and/or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority, (v)
provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect
to, all written communications (including any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Authority
regarding the Offer and the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of
each party, as appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or
from any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or the Merger, and
(vii) cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in, and consider in good faith the views of the other with
respect to, all material deliberations with respect to all efforts to satisfy
the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (C)(1) of _Annex A_ and _Section
8.1(a)_. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of
information by one party to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to
the extent required under applicable Law or to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company or confidential competitively sensitive business
information regarding the parties.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate
with one another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings
not contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be made, and whether any
other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not contemplated by
_Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be obtained, from any Governmental
Authority under any other applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings, furnish information
required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely any such consents,
permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the parties determine are
required to be made or obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

7.3 _Merger_. Following the Acceptance Time, each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the
generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, and
shall not permit and shall cause their respective representatives not to,
take any action that could render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to
the Merger.

  



  

7.4 _Company Board Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.4(b)_ and _Section 7.4(c)_,
the Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept
the Offer and tender their

  



    

-61- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ").

  



  

(b) Except to the extent permitted by this _Section 7.4_ , neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (y) approve, adopt, declare advisable, endorse or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal or publicly propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal (each of clauses (x)
and (y), a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "), or (z) cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; _provided, however_ , that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board or any committee thereof to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, (1) in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal or
an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or (2) in response to the receipt of a Superior
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement in order to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
pursuant to  _Section 9.1(e)_, in either case, if all of the following
conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) and the last paragraph of this
_Section 7.4(b)_ are met:

  



  

(i) A Superior Proposal with respect to the Company has been made
and has not been withdrawn or an Intervening Event has occurred;

  



  

(ii) The Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice (a "
_Change of Recommendation Notice_ ") at least four (4) Business Days prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of this
Agreement, which notice shall state expressly (x) that it has received a
Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event has occurred, (y) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including any financing arrangements) and the identity of the Person or
group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such
Superior Proposal and a copy of all written materials provided by such Person
or group in connection with such Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that
the Company may redact, and not disclose, the identity of the Person or group
making any such Superior Proposal if disclosure of such identity would
violate the terms of a Contract by which the Company is bound as of the date
hereof), or, in the case of an Intervening Event, the material facts and
circumstances related to such Intervening Event, and (z) that it intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that delivery of
a Change of Recommendation Notice shall not, by itself, be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change);

  



  

(iii) The Company Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Company Board

  



    

-62- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
and

  



  

(iv) In the case of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal did not
involve a material breach by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective representatives of any of the provisions set forth in
_Section 6.2_ or this _Section 7.4_.

  



  

During such four (4) Business Days after delivering the Change of
Recommendation Notice, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(the " _Modified Terms_ "), and shall consider and negotiate (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) in good faith with Parent and its representatives
such Modified Terms. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.4(b)_ to the
contrary, the Company Board may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)_ or effect a Company Board Recommendation Change until the
expiration of such four (4) Business Day period and unless and until the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after considering the Modified Terms
(if any are proposed by Parent) and consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_
or to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event of
any material amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal, the Company
shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of occurrence)
notify Parent of any such amendment or modification and, for each of the first
three (3) such amendments or modifications to such Superior Proposal, the
Company Board and its representatives shall be required to negotiate in good
faith with Parent regarding any Modified Terms proposed by Parent in response
to such amendment or modification until the later to occur of two (2)
Business Days after the Company Board provides written notice of such
amendment or modification to Parent and the end of the original four (4)
Business Day period described above. In the event there is a Company Board
Recommendation Change made in compliance with this _Section 7.4(b)_ with
respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall only enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure
to the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
taking of any such position or making of any such disclosure contemplated by
this _Section 7.4(c)_ may be a Company Board Recommendation Change, and, if
so, shall not affect the Company's and the Company Board's duties under this
_Section 7.4_ , including with respect to the Change of Recommendation Notice
and the requirements for making a Company Board Recommendation Change.

  



  

7.5 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. None of the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue
(or shall cause its Affiliates or

  



    

-63- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

representatives to issue) any public release or make any public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release
or announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
NASDAQ, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties
hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release
or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party);
_provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.5_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be
made by the Company in compliance with _Section 7.4_.

  



  

7.6 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Neither the Company nor the Company
Board will take any action that would cause this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to any
state anti-takeover or other similar Law. In the event that any state anti-
takeover or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and
Company Board shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so
that such transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

7.7 _Access_.

  



  

(a) At all times during the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Financing Sources, financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to
the properties, Permits, Contracts, books and records and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and furnish all other information concerning the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request;  _provided, however_ , that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or
information to the extent that, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Company, (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) granting
such access would violate any obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise
breach, contravene or violate, or give a third party the right to terminate
or accelerate rights under, any then effective Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii) access to such documents or
information would give rise to a risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to
such documents or information. In the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of the applicable third party
that is required in order to disclose the applicable information and otherwise
communicate the applicable information to

  



    

-64- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant
to the access contemplated by this _Section 7.7(a)_ shall be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or create a material risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform
invasive testing without the Company's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective Financing Sources,
financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants
and other agents and representatives in connection with any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 7.7(a)_.

  



  

(b) The Company shall prepare monthly and quarterly financial
statements relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX _and the Effective
Time and shall deliver copies thereof to Parent within forty-five (45) days
following the end of each month. All financial statements delivered pursuant
to this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall be in all material respects in
accordance with the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
shall be in a form consistent with such financial statements prepared by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement. During the period from the date
of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall
file with the SEC each of its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q within forty-
five (45) days after the end of the applicable fiscal quarter of the Company;
_provided_ that the Company will file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for

any such indemnification agreement entered into with any person who becomes a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following
the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
shall be in substantially the same form as the indemnification agreements
listed in _Section 7.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "), and (ii) the indemnification, expense advancement
and exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable organizational document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) cause the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than the indemnification,

during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section
7.9(a)_ , during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) indemnify and
hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation expenses),

of or pertains directly or indirectly to any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Person's capacity as such that
occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting in good faith a claim for indemnification under this  _Section
7.9(b)_ , then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th)

Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection
with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an

  



    

-66- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is
ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to control the defense thereof after the Acceptance Time, (ii)
each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense
of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) subject to the
receipt of the undertaking referred to in the preceding sentence, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor

the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv)
no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his
or her prior express written consent; _provided_ that such consent is not
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section 7.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent)
(A) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry (B) shall be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) or (C) shall have any obligation hereunder
to any Indemnified Person if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnified
Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Corporation the
amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

  



  

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
directors' and officers' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by
the Company's currently in force directors' and officers' liability insurance
(" _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), on terms with respect to the coverage
and amounts that are no less favorable than those of the Current Company DandO
Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.9(b)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%)
of the annual amount paid by the Company for coverage during its current
coverage period, which amount is set forth in _Section 7.9(b) _of the
Company Disclosure Letter (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ ");  _provided_ that, if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the Current
Company DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a
"tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving

  



    

-67- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 7.9(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

  



  

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of
its successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 7.9_.

  



  

7.10 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time
(or, if earlier, the date of termination of the applicable
Continuing Employee), the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) provide to each Continuing Employee (i) a base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, and annual cash bonus opportunity, in each
case, that is not less favorable than the base salary or wage rate (as
applicable) and annual bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and
benefits (excluding benefits provided pursuant to any defined benefit pension
plans) that in the case of this clause (ii) are either, in Parent's sole
discretion, (A) taken as a whole, at least as favorable in the aggregate to
the other compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) taken as a whole,
substantially similar to the other compensation and benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the
Company or the Surviving Corporation).

  



  

(b) To the extent that a Plan or any other employee benefit plan or
other compensation or severance arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Plans_ ") or any employee
benefit plan or other compensation or severance arrangement of Parent is made
available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) credit such Continuing Employee for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time solely for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to vacation/paid time off benefits where
length of service is relevant, in any case, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled prior to the Effective Time under any
similar Plan; _provided, however_ , that such service need not be
credited (i) to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits, (ii) under a newly established plan for which prior service is not
taken into account or with respect to any equity based compensation or (iii)
if it results in benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to): (A) ensure that each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively,
the " _New Plans_ ") to the

  



    

-68- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time; (B) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee from and after the Effective Time, (1) cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
such waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence
of insurability requirements or actively-at-work requirements were waived or
satisfied under the comparable Plan, and (2) recognize, or cause to be
recognized, any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents under a Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (C) ensure that the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan are
credited with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee
under the applicable Company Plan solely to the extent the
Continuing Employee commenced participation in the New Plan in the same plan
year as the unused balance was credited to the corresponding Plan.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee
employment for any Person for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of, any
Continuing Employee for any reason, (ii) require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to continue any Plan, Company Plan or New Plan or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time, or
(iii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Plan, Company
Plan or New Plan. The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or other Person shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
no provision of this _Section 7.10 _ shall create such rights in any such
persons.

  



  

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Parent at least ten (10) days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate any and all Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of
the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), such termination effective not
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing. In the event of such
termination, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company
401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant to resolution (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to prior review and approval by Parent)
of the Company Board. In the event of such termination, Parent shall cause
each Continuing Employee who is a participant in a Company 401(k) Plan to be
allowed to participate, effective as of the Closing, in a tax qualified plan
which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored and maintained by
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and such
Continuing Employee shall be credited with eligibility service and vesting
service for all periods

  



    

-69-

of service with the Company or any other entity to the extent so credited
with such service under the applicable Company 401(k) Plan. In
addition, Parent shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, take all actions
necessary so that the Parent 401(k) Plan will accept rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) from the Company 401(k)
Plan.

Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this

failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the

expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer); _provided,

their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate with the Company in the defense or settlement of
any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parent's views with
respect to such stockholder litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company shall not settle such Legal Proceedings
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

  



  

7.14 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board or
its independent directors, to the extent required under applicable Law) will
take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause each Plan, in all

financial statements and business and other financial data and information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent in

-72-

logos in connection with any Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company will use reasonable
best efforts to provide Parent with updates to the Required Information so
that marketing materials used in any Financing do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein not misleading as a result of a misstatement or
omission with respect to the Required Information, other than, in each case,
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition
Sub. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, in the
Confidentiality Agreement or in any other agreement between the Company and
Parent (or its Affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and its Affiliates
may share information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including customary projections with respect to the Company and its business,
with the Financing Sources, and that Parent, its Affiliates and such
Financing Sources may share such information with potential Financing Sources
in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with any Financing,
_provided_ that the recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements. The Company shall have the right to review and
comment on the portions of such marketing materials relating to the Company
prior to the dissemination of such materials to any counterparties to any
proposed financing transaction (or filing with any Governmental Authority);
_provided_ that the Company shall communicate in writing its comments, if any,
to Parent and its counsel within a reasonable period of time under the
circumstances and consistent with the time accorded to other participants who
were asked to review and comment on such marketing materials. Parent shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives in
connection with any Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and representatives contemplated by this _Section 7.17_.
Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining any financing
is not a condition to the Offer or to the Closing.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such

Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on
the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or parties),
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties) under this Agreement.

distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), or any change in the Common Stock by reason
of any split-up, reverse stock split, reorganization,
recapitalization, combination, reclassification, exchange of shares or the
like, the terms "Existing Shares" and "Covered Shares" shall be deemed to

shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction.

  



  

4.3. _Notice of Acquisitions_. Each Principal Holder shall notify Parent as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after

Principal Holder may have under applicable Laws or otherwise, including

MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

5.1. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate, and no party shall have
any rights or obligations hereunder, (a) automatically, without any notice or
other action by any Person, upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective
Time, (ii) a Company Board Recommendation Change and (iii) the Merger
Agreement Termination Date, or (b) with respect to any Principal Holder, upon
the mutual written agreement of Parent and such Principal Holder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Article V_ (other
than  _Section 5.4_ ) shall survive any termination of this Agreement without
regard to any temporal limitation. Neither the provisions of this _Section
5.1_ nor the termination of this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from
any liability to any other party arising out of or in connection with a prior
breach of this Agreement.

  



  

5.2. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent or Acquisition Sub any direct or indirect ownership
or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All
rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares
remain vested in and belong to the applicable Principal Holder, and nothing
herein shall, or shall be construed to, grant Parent any power, sole or
shared, to direct or control the voting or disposition of any of the
Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

expenses incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in

party incurring those expenses.

  



  

5.4. _Public Announcements_. Except as required by applicable Law (in which
case the Principal Holder required to make the announcement will use his
reasonable efforts to allow Parent reasonable time to comment on such
announcement in advance of such issuance), no public announcements by any
Principal Holder regarding this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Merger Agreement or the Transactions are permitted. Each
Principal Holder (a) consents to and authorizes the publication and disclosure
by Parent and its Affiliates of his identity and holding of the Covered
Shares and the nature of his commitments and obligations under this Agreement
in any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC or other Governmental
Authority, the Offer or any other disclosure document in connection with the
Offer, the Merger, any other Transaction or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees to give to Parent any information it may
reasonably require for the preparation of any such disclosure documents and
(c) agrees to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with respect
to any written information supplied by him specifically for use in any such
disclosure document, if any, to the extent that any shall be or have become
false or misleading in any material respect.

5.9. _Entire Agreement; No-Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
Merger Agreement (and the schedules, annexes and exhibits hereto and thereto)
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties
hereto and thereto as contemplated by or referred to herein or therein,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both

matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon
any Person (other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns) any rights, benefits, obligations, liabilities or remedies
hereunder.

  



  

5.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the
Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

  



  

5.11. _Assignment_. Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, no party
may assign (by operation of Law or otherwise) either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties, except that Acquisition Sub may assign, in its
sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
to any direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent without the prior written
approval of the Principal Holders. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and Permitted Transferees. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void _ab initio_.

  



  

5.12. _Specific Enforcement; Submission to Jurisdiction; Service_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Principal Holders, on the
one hand, or Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Principal Holders, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement. The Principal Holders, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition
Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or
parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any action or
proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for
and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance
with _Section 5.5_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
Law, and nothing in this _Section 5.12(b)_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law;
(ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not
have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (iii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any
actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
within the State of Delaware); (v) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Principal Holders agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.

  



  

5.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
PRINCIPAL HOLDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR THE PRINCIPAL HOLDERS IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  



  

5.14. _Amendment; Waiver_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and
the Principal Holders (or, in the case of an Amendment relating only to a
certain Principal Holder, by each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and such
Principal Holder); _provided, however_ , no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement that requires the approval of Company Stockholders under Delaware
Law or the rules of NASDAQ, without such approval. At any time and from
time to time prior to the Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to
the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party

or parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

  



  

5.15. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

5.16. _Action by Stockholder Capacity Only_. Parent acknowledges that each
Principal Holder has entered into this Agreement solely in his capacity as
the record and/or beneficial owner of the Covered Shares (and not in any
other capacity, including any capacity as a director or officer of the
Company). Nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by any
Principal Holder, or require a Principal Holder to take any action, in each
case, in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including to
disclose information acquired solely in their capacity as a director or
officer of the Company, and any actions taken (whatsoever), or failure to take
any actions (whatsoever), by him in such capacity as a director or officer of
the Company shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.

  



  

5.17. _Several, Not Joint Obligations_. The representations, warranties,
covenants and other obligations of the Principal Holders under this
Agreement are, in all respects, several and not joint, such that no Principal
Holder shall be liable or otherwise responsible for any
representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations of any other
Principal Holder, or any breach or violation thereof.

Corporation to provide broader director protection rights than permitted prior
thereto),  no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the

the Corporation1, to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation
Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits
the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law
permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), or any other
applicable laws as presently or hereinafter in effect. The right to
indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder shall not be exclusive
of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or by-laws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. 
---|---|---

provisions from Receptos by-laws.
