     |  

SECTION 1.01.

     |  

_Sale of the Transferred Equity Interests_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause the other
Transferors to, sell, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser or its designees,
and the Purchaser or its designees shall purchase and accept from the
Transferors, the Transferred Equity Interests free and  clear of all Liens
for an aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") determined as
follows: (x) $692.5 million in cash plus (y) $98 million in an amount of the
Seller's Variable Rate Toggle Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2013, taking into
account principal amount (including any increase in principal amount pursuant
to the terms of such notes since the issue date thereof) and accrued and
unpaid interest thereon as of the close of business on the  Closing Date plus
(z) $124.5 million in an amount of the Seller's Senior Subordinated Notes due
February 1, 2015 with interest payable semiannually at 7.375% (such Variable
Rate Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes are collectively referred to as the "
_Notes_ "), taking into account principal and accrued and unpaid interest
thereon as of the close of business on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that such amounts of cash  and Notes shall be (i)
increased by the Working Capital Overage, if any, (ii) decreased by the
Working Capital Underage, if any, (iii) decreased by the Final Assumed
Indebtedness Amount, if any,

(iv) decreased by any Transaction Expenses of the Transferred Entities not
paid prior to Closing or accrued and included in the "total A/P" of the
Transferred Entities in Closing Working Capital, and (v) decreased by the
EBITDA Price Adjustment, if any ((i),(ii),(iii), (iv) and (v) being
collectively referred to as the " _Closing Adjustments_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that this provision shall exclude the amounts of any accrued and
unpaid interest as of the close of business on the Closing Date on the Notes
provided for in subsections (y) and (z), but such exclusion shall apply if and
only to the extent that (I) the record date in respect of the payment of such
accrued and unpaid interest occurs on or prior to the Closing Date and (II)
the holder of the applicable Notes on such record date (excluding the Seller
or any of its  Subsidiaries in the event that the record date and the Closing
Date occur on the same day) will receive payment in cash in respect of such
accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable payment date therefor
notwithstanding the transfer of such Notes to the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement prior to the applicable payment date for such accrued and unpaid
interest. To the extent the aggregate amount of the Closing Adjustments
increases the Purchase Price, such increase shall be  payable in cash and, to
the extent the aggregate amount of the Closing Adjustments decreases the
Purchase Price, the amount of such decrease shall reduce the Purchase Price on

(a) _Section 3.07(a)_ of the Seller Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all real property owned by
the Transferred Entities or the Seller or any of its subsidiaries other than
the Transferred Entities and used in the Business (each, an " _Owned Property_
"), including  the name of the entity owning each such Owned Property (each a
" _Property Owning Entity_ "). _Section 3.07(a)_ of the Seller Letter sets
forth a complete and correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all

Entity_ "). Each Property Owning Entity has good, marketable and valid fee
title to each Owned Property it owns (including any and all improvements
located thereon) and each Leasing Entity has good and valid title to the
leasehold estates in all Leased Property it leases (an Owned Property or a
Leased Property being sometimes referred to herein, individually, as a "

area, encroachments, or any other non-monetary Liens of a minor nature. None
of the items set forth in clauses (i) and (iii) through (vi) above,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to materially impair
the continued use and operation of the Transferred Real Property to which it
or they relate in the conduct of the Business as currently conducted or
materially  impair the value of the Transferred Real Property. The
Transferred Real Property includes all the real property currently used by the
Transferred Entities or the Seller or any subsidiary in the operation of the
Business (the " _Currently Utilized Real Property_ ").

  

(b) _Section 3.07(b)_ of the Seller Letter sets forth each lease,
sublease, license or occupancy agreement in respect of a Leased Property
(each, a " _Lease_ "), which schedule sets forth the date of and parties to
each Lease and  any amendments or modifications thereto. Each Lease is, as of
the date of this Agreement, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Leasing Entity a party thereto and is in full force and effect and enforceable
against such Leasing Entity in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a  proceeding in equity or at
Law. As of the date of this Agreement, the Leasing Entity is in possession of
each applicable Leased Property. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
lessee under any Lease (or sublessee in the case of a sublease) nor, to the
knowledge of the Seller, any other party to such Lease is in material breach
or material default under such Lease and no event has occurred and no
condition exists which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, 
would constitute such a default or breach. No Leasing Entity has received
written notice of the termination of any Lease and to the knowledge of the
Seller no other party to any Lease has orally threatened to terminate such
Lease. The Seller has made available to the Purchaser a true, complete and
correct copy of each Lease, in each case as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

(c) All buildings, structures, material fixtures and material
improvements included within the Transferred Real Property (the "
_Improvements_ ") are in good repair and operating condition, subject to
ordinary wear and tear, and are suitable for the purposes for which they are 
presently used, in each case in all material respects.

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its
subsidiaries has received written notice or has knowledge of any pending,
threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting the Transferred
Real Property or any part thereof or of any sale or other disposition of the
Transferred Real Property or any part thereof in  lieu of condemnation.

  

(e) No portion of the Owned Property is located in a special flood
hazard area as designated by federal Governmental Entities.

of each of (ii)(x) and (ii)(y), any license granted by a third party for off
the shelf software that is commercially available on a retail basis for less
than $50,000 in the aggregate (the " _Inbound Licensed Intellectual Property_
"), including the name of the entity licensing such Inbound Licensed
Intellectual Property. The Owned Intellectual  Property and the Inbound
Licensed Intellectual Property are referred to collectively as the "
_Transferred Intellectual Property_ "; _provided_ that the "Transferred
Intellectual Property" does not include any Software to be provided by the
Seller or its subsidiaries after the Closing pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement. With respect to all Owned Intellectual Property that is
registered or subject to an application for registration,  _Section 3.08(a)_
of the Seller Letter sets forth a list, as of the date of this Agreement, of
all jurisdictions in which such Owned Intellectual Property is registered or
where registrations have been applied for and all registration and application
numbers. All such registrations and applications are not the subject of any
invalidity proceeding or determination, and have not been or are not, as
applicable, cancelled, expired, opposed, abandoned or otherwise terminated, 
and payment of all renewal and maintenance fees that have become due and owing
in respect thereof has been duly made. Except as set forth in _Section
3.08(a)_ of the Seller Letter, the Transferred Entities, Seller and its
subsidiaries other than the Transferred Entities own or otherwise have the

all the Transferred Intellectual Property as currently used in the Business.
Except as set forth in _Section 3.08(a)_ of the Seller Letter, neither the

holds, is obligated under or has granted, any option, right of first offer,
right of first refusal, license or other contractual right to purchase,
acquire, sell or dispose of the Transferred  Intellectual Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein.

  

(b) The Seller, the Transferred Entities and any other subsidiaries of
the Seller have taken all reasonably necessary actions to maintain and protect
each item of Owned Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in _Section
3.08(b)_ of the Seller Letter, each of the Seller, the Transferred  Entities
and any subsidiary of the Seller other than a Transferred Entity, has (i)
secured and has a current policy to secure from employees, consultants and
other persons who contribute or have contributed to the creation or
development of any of the Owned Intellectual Property, written assignments of
the rights to such contributions that the Seller, the Transferred Entities or
any subsidiaries of the Seller other than the Transferred Entities, do not
already own by operation  of Law and (ii) made any and all notifications or
filings required by applicable Law to ensure that all Intellectual

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

16

  

 

  



  

Property used in the Business created by any employee of the Transferred
Entities, the Seller or a subsidiary of the Seller other than a Transferred
Entity, is owned by such entity.

  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.08(c)_ of the Seller Letter, the
consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not alter or impair any rights of the Transferred Entities
in and to any Transferred Intellectual Property. No third-party  consent is
necessary for the exercise by the appropriate Transferred Entity of its rights
in or to the Transferred Intellectual Property.

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Seller has not and no
Transferred Entity or a subsidiary of the Seller other than a Transferred
Entity has granted any license, written or, to the Seller's knowledge, oral,
relating to any Transferred Intellectual Property or the marketing or
distribution thereof, except as set forth in  _Section 3.08(b)_ of the
Seller Letter (the " _Outbound Licensed Intellectual Property_ ").

  

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 3.08(e)_ of the Seller Letter: (i)
to the knowledge of the Seller, the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted and the use of the Transferred Intellectual Property do not violate,
conflict with or infringe the Intellectual Property of any  other person;
(ii) as of the date of this Agreement, no claims that have been asserted in
writing by any person are pending or threatened, against the Seller, a
Transferred Entity or a subsidiary of the Seller other than a Transferred
Entity with respect to the ownership, validity, enforceability, effectiveness
or use in the Business of any Intellectual Property; and (iii) since May 1,
2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement, the Seller has not and no
Transferred  Entity or a subsidiary of the Seller other than a Transferred
Entity has received any written communication alleging that the Seller, a
Transferred Entity or a subsidiary of the Seller other than a Transferred
Entity has violated in any material respect any rights relating to
Intellectual Property of any person. To the Seller's knowledge, no third party
is infringing or otherwise violating in any material respect the Owned
Intellectual Property and there is no litigation  currently pending or
threatened alleging the same.

  

(f) The Seller and any subsidiaries of the Seller other than
Transferred Entities, have taken commercially reasonable efforts to protect
the trade secrets and the confidential Technology used in the Business. To the
knowledge of the Seller, there has been no misappropriation by any person of
any trade secrets or other Technology used in  the Business as currently
conducted and no such trade secrets or other such Technology have been
disclosed to any person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-
disclosure and/or license agreements that have not been breached. To the
Seller's knowledge, no employee, independent contractor, or agent of any
Transferred Entity, the Seller or any subsidiary other than a Transferred
Entity, (i) has misappropriated any trade secrets or other Intellectual
Property of any  other person, or (ii) is in default or breach of any term of
any employment agreement, non-disclosure agreement, assignment of invention
agreement or similar agreement relating to the protection, ownership,
development, use or transfer of any Intellectual Property. To the Seller's
knowledge, all material computer software programs used in the conduct of the
Business perform in material conformance with their documentation and are free
from any material software  defect.

(g) Any open source software used by any of the Transferred Entities is
either listed in _Section 3.08(g)_ of the Seller Letter or is not a material
part of the software used in the Business. No use of open source software by
the Seller, a Transferred Entity or a subsidiary of the Seller other than a
Transferred Entity requires any  Transferred Entity to disclose any software,
as a whole or any material part thereof, to the public.

accordance with all applicable Laws and have filed or caused to be filed in a
timely manner (within any applicable extension periods) all income and other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by  applicable national, state,
county, local municipal, foreign or other Tax Laws. All such Tax Returns were
complete and correct in all material respects. All material Taxes with respect
to taxable periods covered by such Tax Returns (whether or not shown on any

group of which any Transferred Entity is or has been a member for any taxable
period and no request for any such waiver or extension is currently pending.

  

(d) No material Tax Return of any Transferred Entity or, to the extent
relating to the Transferred Entities, any affiliated group of which any
Transferred Entity is a member is under audit or examination by any Taxing
Authority, and no written notice of any such an audit or examination has been
received by the Seller. Since May 1, 2005  and prior to the date of this
Agreement, no written claim has been received by the Seller from a Taxing
Authority in a jurisdiction where any Transferred Entity does not currently
file Tax Returns that such Transferred Entity is or may be subject to taxation

existence, and the aforementioned fiscal unities will be terminated with
effect as per expiry of the Closing Date (midnight German time) without
(retroactively) affecting the validity of the fiscal unity for German Tax
purposes. Any Tax or any payment replacing Tax such as a Tax compensation
claim resulting from the disruption or termination of any fiscal unity or
consolidated group that involves any of the German Entities has been paid or
accrued for. No German Entity has been or  will be held secondarily liable
for any Tax of another member of a present or former fiscal unity or other
consolidated group. The German Entities will not be subject to any Tax
relating to the measures taken in connection with the procedures outlined in
_Exhibit G_ hereto, in excess of the amount offset against the claim of
Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH for the transfer of profits for the applicable
period until termination of the  PLTA.

  

(h) For German Tax purposes during the period of ownership by the Seller
preceding the Closing Date (i) no assets have been contributed, or deemed to

value or at another value below the going concern value  ( _Teilwert_ ) of
individual assets, or acquired by any of the German Entities at such value
through restructuring measures or in any other way; (ii) no spin-off (
_Abspaltung or Aufspaltung_ ) at book value has been carried out regarding the
German Entities; (iii) none of the German Entities has reduced, nor will it

21

  

 

  



  

is required to keep for tax purposes will be readily available at the
respective German Entity as of the Closing Date; (vii) the company has
maintained transfer pricing documentation of the German Entities; (viii) no
binding ruling or other decision of a Taxing Authority has been issued that
would in the future impair, limit or otherwise influence the conduct of
business or a reorganization  of any Transferred Entity.

  

(i) Since May 1, 2005, no Transferred Entity or affiliated group of
which any Transferred Entity is or has been a member has taken any reporting
position on a Tax Return, which reporting position (i) if not sustained would
be reasonably likely, absent disclosure, to give rise to a penalty for
substantial understatement of  federal income Tax under Section 6662 of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law), and (ii)
has not adequately been disclosed on such Tax Return in accordance with
Section 6662(d)(2)(B) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local,
or foreign Tax Law).

  

(j) The Transferred Entities have each withheld from their respective
employees, independent contractors, creditors, stockholders and third parties

applicable Laws;

23

  

 

  



  

meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), is referred

(b) Each Assumed Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the

to the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or similar proceedings
pending with the IRS, DOL or other Governmental Entity, and there are no
claims, actions or litigation which have been made, or to the knowledge of
Seller threatened, with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits payable in the ordinary course).

  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(c)(i)_ of the Seller Letter,
no Assumed Benefit Plan is a single-employer plan that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (a " _Title IV Plan_ "). Upon and 
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
none of the Purchaser or any Transferred

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

24

  

 

  



  

Entity would reasonably be expected to incur any material liability under
Title IV of ERISA as a result of being treated as a single employer with the
Seller or any Seller Commonly Controlled Entity. With respect to any Assumed
Benefit Plan that is a Title IV Plan, (i) all premiums due the PBGC have been
paid, (ii) neither the Seller, the Transferred Entities nor any of their
respective  affiliates have filed a notice of intent to terminate the plan or
adopted any amendment to treat such plan as terminated, (iii) the PBGC has not
instituted, or threatened to institute, proceedings to treat such plan as
terminated, (iv) no event has occurred or circumstance exists that constitutes
grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment

expect to be, subject to (A) any requirement to post security pursuant to

Code. Neither the Seller, the Transferred Entities nor any of their respective
affiliates have incurred any liability with respect to the termination of a
Title IV Plan within the last six years or incurred any outstanding liability
under Section 4062 of ERISA to the PBGC or to a trustee appointed under
Section 4042 of ERISA. Neither the Seller, the Transferred Entities nor any
organization to which the Seller or any Transferred Entity is a successor or
parent corporation,  within the meaning of Section 4069(b) of ERISA, has
engaged in any transaction described in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

Agreement, participated in a Multiemployer Plan.

  

(e) Each Seller Benefit Plan, that is intended to meet the requirements
of a "qualified plan" under Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS upon which it may rely to the effect that
the employee pension benefit plan is qualified and satisfies the requirements
of Section 401(a) of  the Code and that its related trust is exempt from
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and to the knowledge of Seller,
there are no facts or circumstances that are expected to cause the loss of
such qualification.

  

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(f)_ of the Seller Letter,
none of the Seller or any Seller Commonly Controlled Entity has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been required to maintain or contribute to, or
has any actual or contingent liability under any Seller Benefit  Plan subject
to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code.

  

(g) There have been no prohibited transactions within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any Assumed
Benefit

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

25

  

 

  



  

Plan that are not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code

any other applicable Laws in connection with the administration or investment
of the  assets of any Assumed Benefit Plan.

  

(h) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.14(h)_ of the Seller Letter,

the transactions contemplated hereby shall (i) result in any material payment
(including severance, change in control or otherwise) becoming  due to any
Business Employee under any Assumed Benefit Plan or Assumed Benefit Agreement,
(ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Assumed
Benefit Plan or Assumed Benefit Agreement to any Business Employee or (iii)
result in the acceleration of time of payment or vesting of any such benefits
under any Assumed Benefit Plan or Assumed Benefit Agreement, except, in the
case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), for any payments or 
benefits for which the Seller or any of its affiliates (other than any
Transferred Entity) shall be solely liable.

  

(i) Neither the Seller nor its affiliates (including the Transferred
Entities) has any plan, contract or legally binding commitment, nor have they
announced (orally or in writing) an intention, to create any additional

applicable to Business Employees or, except  as may be required by applicable
Law, to modify, amend, suspend or terminate any Assumed Benefit Plan or
Assumed Benefit Agreement.

  

(j) The Transferred Entities do not have any outstanding liability or
obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _WARN Act_ "), or any similar state
or local law that remains unsatisfied.

  

(k) No Assumed Benefit Plan provides, and, except as set forth in
_Section 3.14(k)_ of the Seller Letter, the Transferred Entities have not
incurred any current or projected liability in respect of, post-employment
health, medical, life insurance or death benefits for any current or former 
Business Employees, except as may be required under COBRA, and at the expense
of the employee or former employee (collectively, " _Retiree Medical
Liability_ ").

  

(l) None of the Transferred Entities has any material liability,
whether absolute or contingent, including any obligations under any Seller
Benefit Plan, with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee.

  

(m) Each Assumed Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) to the
extent subject to Section 409A of the Code, has been operated and administered
since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations  issued thereunder. No Transferred Entity has any
commitment to compensate or reimburse any individual for penalty taxes imposed
under Section 409A of the Code.

jurisdiction of the United States, including any such plan required to be
maintained or contributed to by applicable law, custom or rule of the relevant

Altersvorsorge) (" _Foreign Plan_ "): (i) all employer and employee
contributions to each Foreign Plan required by law or by the terms of such
Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with
normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded
through insurance or the book  reserve established for any Foreign Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Plan, and no transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than

investigations, other proceedings or claims of any nature, civil, criminal,
regulatory or otherwise,  pending or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser,
threatened against the Purchaser or any of its affiliates or (c)
investigations by any Governmental Entity that are, to the knowledge of the

Acquisition.

thereto. The Purchaser has not taken any action or omitted to take  any
action, nor has any event occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of the
Purchaser under any term or condition of the Equity Financing Commitments, and

Equity Financing contained in the Equity Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied on a timely basis. The Equity Financing, when funded in accordance

use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries'
independent accountants, legal counsel and other advisors to, provide such
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any Debt

_provided_ , that none of the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall be

_Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Except as provided in the following sentence, Section 1.04(b),
paragraph (b) of this Section 5.04, Section 5.18 and Section 6.04(b), each
party shall bear its and its affiliates' fees, costs and expenses (including
fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel and other Representatives) incurred
by them in  connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and consummation of the Acquisition, the Equity Financing
and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, all fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of
legal counsel) incurred in connection with compliance with and filings and
approvals under merger control and competition Laws, including the HSR Act,
shall be shared equally by the Purchaser  on the one hand, and the Seller on
the other hand.

  

(b) All sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration,
documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar Taxes (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") and all notary fees applicable to the transfer of the
Transferred Equity Interests or the Transferred Equity Interests  shall be
shared equally by the Purchaser on the one hand, and the Seller on the other
hand. The parties agree that the transfer of the equity interests in the
German Entities shall not give rise to any liability for German VAT, and that
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall make any election that is inconsistent with
such agreement. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avail
itself of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to
cooperate with the  other in providing any information and documentation that
may be necessary to obtain such exemptions. The Purchaser, the Seller and the
Transferred Entities shall jointly file all required returns and similar
statements and take all other actions under all applicable transfer
notification statutes and regulations and all applicable Tax statutes and
regulations that are required to be made or taken by the parties in connection
with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement.

  

       



     |  

SECTION 5.05.

     |  

_Tax Matters_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) _Return Filings_. For any taxable period of the Transferred
Entities that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall timely prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file with the appropriate
Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay (or 
cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; provided,
however, that upon notification by the Purchaser of any amount owed by the
Seller pursuant to Section 9.01(a) with respect to the taxable periods covered
by such Tax Returns,

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

43

  

 

  



  

the Seller shall remit such amount to the Purchaser at least five days before
such Tax Return is due. In the case of any Tax Return for any taxable period
of the Transferred Entities that ends on or before the Closing Date (other
than consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns), the Seller shall timely
prepare, on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Business, and
shall deliver such  Tax Return to the Purchaser at least ten days prior to
the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed with the appropriate
Taxing Authority for the review and approval of the Purchaser, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Purchaser disputes
any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify the Seller of such disputed item
(or items) and the basis for its objection. Such parties shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute prior to  the date on which the relevant
Tax Return is required to be filed. If such parties cannot resolve any
disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser. The fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Seller and
the Purchaser. The Seller shall timely file with the appropriate Taxing
Authorities all such Tax Returns required to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date  and shall fully pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of
such Tax Returns. The Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be filed) with
the appropriate Taxing Authorities all such Tax Returns required to be filed
after the Closing Date, and the Seller shall pay all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns by remitting the amount due to the Purchaser at least five
days before such Tax Return is due. Neither the Purchaser nor its affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities)  shall amend any prior Tax Return of any
of the Transferred Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(b) _Other Tax Matters_. The Seller shall include the income of the
Transferred Entities (including any deferred income triggered into income
under Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 and any excess
loss accounts taken into income under Treasury Regulations  Section
1.1502-19, and any income triggered under any comparable provisions of state,
local or foreign law) resulting from or related to transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, on the relevant Seller group consolidated, combined and
unitary Tax Returns for all periods through and including the Closing Date and
pay any federal, foreign, state or local income Taxes attributable to such
income. The Purchaser may at its sole discretion make an election under 
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any of the Transferred Entities
organized outside the United States.

  

(c) _Cooperation_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their affiliates and Representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with 
Taxes and in resolving all suits, claims, actions, investigations, proceedings
or audits (collectively, " _Actions_ ") with respect to all taxable periods
relating to Taxes involving or otherwise relating to the Transferred Entities.
The Seller and its affiliates will need access, from time to time, after the
Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held by
the Transferred Entities to the extent  such records and information pertain
to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause each Transferred Entity to, (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain such records for ten years
and shall thereafter provide the Seller with written notice prior to any
destruction, abandonment or disposition, (ii) transfer

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

44

  

 

  



  

such records to the Seller upon its written request prior to any such
destruction, abandonment or disposition and (ii) allow the Seller and its
Representatives (and Representatives of any of its affiliates), at times and
dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies
of such records as the Seller may deem necessary or appropriate from time to
time, such activities  to be conducted during normal business hours and at
the Seller's expense. Any information obtained under this Section 5.05(c)
shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of an audit or other Action.

  

(d) _Refunds and Credits_. Any refund or credit of Taxes of the
Transferred Entities for, or any tax benefit or reduction (including as a
result of any overpayment of Taxes in prior periods) accruing to the Purchaser
or any of its affiliates as a result of the ownership of the Business that
is  a refund of Taxes paid in, any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be for the account of the Seller, unless any such refund or
credit is attributable to the carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period of
items of loss, deductions or other Tax items of the Transferred Entities (or
any of their affiliates, including the Purchaser). Any refund or credit of
Taxes of the Transferred Entities for, or any tax benefit or reduction
(including as a result of any overpayment  of Taxes in prior periods)
accruing to the Purchaser or any of its affiliates as a result of the
ownership of the Business and attributable to any Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between the Purchaser and the Seller in accordance with
the principles of Section 9.01(c).

  

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Seller shall cause the provisions of
any agreement relating to the sharing, allocation or indemnification of Taxes,
or any similar agreement, contract or arrangement (collectively, " _Tax
Sharing  Agreements_ ") between the Seller or any of their affiliates (other
than the Transferred Entities) and any Transferred Entity to be terminated on
or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party shall have any
rights or obligations under any such Tax Sharing Agreement or liability for
Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1502-6, 1.1502-78,
or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as a transferee or 
successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  

(f) _Closing Date_. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause
each Transferred Entity to conduct its business in the ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as currently conducted and on the Closing Date
shall not permit any Transferred Entity to effect any extraordinary 
transactions (other than any such transactions expressly required by
applicable law or by this Agreement) that would reasonably be expected to
result in Tax liability to any Transferred Entity in excess of Tax liability
associated with the conduct of its business in the ordinary course.

  

(g) _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller agree to treat only
amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.01 of this Agreement as consideration
for the assets of the Business and equity interests of the Transferred 
Entities or any adjustment to the Purchase Price, and no other amounts payable
from the Purchaser to the Seller or from the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant
hereto. The Seller agrees that it will not take the position that any amount
payable pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement is deductible as an expense
to the Seller or any of

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

45

  

 

  



  

its affiliates for any income Tax purpose. Neither the Purchaser nor the
Seller shall file any Tax Return, or take a position with any Taxing
Authority, that (i) is inconsistent with the Allocation or (ii) treats the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, unless required to do so by a final determination and
after which prompt  notice thereof shall be given to the other party to this
Agreement.

     |  

_Elections Under Section 338(h)(10)_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(i) With respect to the purchase of Transferred Equity Interests
hereunder, the Seller (and to the extent necessary, the Transferred Entities)
and the Purchaser shall jointly make timely and irrevocable elections under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and if permissible, similar elections under
any applicable  U.S. state and local or foreignTax Laws (collectively, the "
_Section 338 Elections_"). The Seller shall include any income, gain, loss,
deduction, or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338 Elections on their
Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. The Seller shall pay any
Taxes imposed on the Seller or the Transferred Entities attributable to the
making of the Section 338 Elections,  including (i) any Taxes imposed under
the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and
(ii) any state, local or foreign Taxes imposed on the Seller\'s or the
Transferred Entities\' gain.

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall prepare (and shall be solely responsible for
preparing) any and all forms necessary to effect the Section 338 Elections
(including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883, and any similar forms under applicable
U.S. state and local or foreign Tax Laws) (collectively, the  " _Section 338
Forms_"). The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser in the preparation of
the Section 338 Forms and shall execute such Section 338 Forms as may be
necessary. The properly executed IRS Form 8023 shall be delivered to the
Purchaser at or prior to the Closing.

  

(iii) Within ninety days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller a draft schedule allocating the "aggregate
deemed sales price" (" _ADSP_ ") for purposes of Section 338(h)(10) among the
assets of the  Transferred Entities in accordance with the applicable
Treasury regulations (the " _Draft Allocation_ "). Within thirty days of its
receipt of such Draft Allocation, the Seller will provide the Purchaser with a
written notice of any proposed changes thereto, together with a detailed
explanation of the basis for such proposed changes. If the Seller does not
provide the Purchaser with any proposed changes within such thirty  day
period, the Draft Allocation shall become final (the " _Final Allocation_ ").
If the Seller timely notifies the Purchaser of any proposed changes to the
Draft Allocation, the parties shall discuss such proposed changes in good
faith and shall attempt to resolve any dispute. If the parties are able to
reach a mutually satisfactory agreement as to any proposed changes, the Draft
Allocation shall be modified to reflect such  agreed changes and shall become
the Final Allocation. In the event that the parties cannot agree on an
allocation schedule within thirty days after the Purchaser's receipt of the
Seller's notice of proposed changes, the dispute shall be resolved by a
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by the

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

46

  

 

  



  

Purchaser and the Seller (or if they cannot agree on the selection, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall each select a nationally recognized accounting
firm, which two firms shall select a third nationally recognized accounting
firm to resolve the dispute). The resolution by such nationally recognized
accounting firm shall be binding on both parties. The Draft Allocation shall
be  modified to reflect such resolution (and any other agreed proposed
changes) and shall become the Final Allocation.

  

(iv) The Purchaser, the Transferred Entities and the Seller shall file
all Tax Returns (including the Section 338 Forms) consistent with the Final
Allocation and shall not voluntarily take any action inconsistent therewith
upon examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or
otherwise with  respect to such Tax Returns, unless required to pursuant to a
final determination of any governmental authority; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the deemed purchase price of the assets may differ from the ADSP to the
extent necessary to reflect (A) the Purchaser's capitalized transaction costs
not included in the total ADSP, (B) any liabilities or other items included in
the ADSP but not included in the deemed purchase price; _provided_ _further_
,  that the amount realized upon the deemed sale of assets may differ from
the ADSP to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount realized for
federal income Tax purposes.

  

(v) The Purchaser shall bear all of the costs and expenses of preparing
the Section 338 Forms and the Draft and Final Allocations _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser and the Seller shall share equally the costs of
any accounting firm required to resolve any dispute under  _Section
5.05(h)(iii)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Seller shall bear the costs
and expenses incurred by the Seller in connection with the review of the Draft
Allocation or any Section 338 Form or the execution of any Section 338 Form.

SECTION 5.06.

     |  

_Employee Matters_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities or the
Purchaser shall, or the Purchaser shall cause its affiliates to, employ or
continue the employment of, each Business Employee listed in _Section
3.14(a)(i) _ of the Seller Letter who is actively employed by Seller or its
affiliates as of the Closing Date  (each, an " _Active Employee_ "). _Section
3.14(a)(i)_ of the Seller Letter contains a list of all Active Employees as of
the date hereof, which list shall be updated by the Seller no later than three
(3) business days prior to the Closing to reflect employee terminations and
other changes of employment status (e _._ g _._ , return from authorized
absences) through three (3) business days prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  no new employee may be added to such list following the
date hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, any Business Employee who is not
actively at work on the Closing Date due to an approved leave of absence
(including due to short term or long term disability leave, vacation, holiday,
sick leave, workers compensation, maternity or paternity leave, military
leave, jury duty or bereavement leave, but not including due to lay off,
unauthorized leave of absence or other leave for bad  behavior) in compliance
with the applicable policies of the Seller and its affiliates, shall be
considered an Active Employee. Business Employees of the Transferred Entities
on the Closing Date and Business Employees who become employees of the
Purchaser or one of its affiliates, as of

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

47

  

 

  



  

the Closing Date, shall be referred to as " _Transferred Employees_ ".
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the
Closing those employees set forth on _Section 5.06(a)(i)_ of the Seller
Letter, although no longer employees of the Seller or any of its affiliates,
shall continue to receive long-term disability benefits pursuant to an
employee  benefit plan sponsored by the Seller to the extent so provided
under such plan.

  

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Seller will cause the Transferred
Entities to cease participation in any Seller Benefit Plan that covers
employees who are not Business Employees, and the Business Employees will no
longer be entitled to active participation in and coverage under such Seller
Benefit Plans.

  

(c) During the period from the Closing Date until the 12-month
anniversary of the Closing Date (such period, the " _Continuation Period_ "),
the Purchaser or its affiliates shall provide each Transferred Employee with
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits  provided to the Transferred Employees
immediately prior to the Closing, and the Purchaser or its affiliates shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such benefits (the " _New
Welfare Plans_ ") are provided without any gap in coverage; _provided_ that
none of the Purchaser or any of its affiliates shall have any obligation to
issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for (i) the issuance of
equity or equity-based compensation,  (ii) the provision of post-retirement
medical coverage, (iii) a U.S. qualified or non-qualified defined benefit
pension plan, (iv) except as provided in Section 5.06(j)(ii), severance and
other separation benefits or (v) bonus plans (including but not limited to
annual bonus plans), and the items listed in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)
and (v) shall not herewith be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether such compensation and  benefits are comparable. The phrase "without
any gap in coverage" means that there will be no waiting period for
participation in such plans, actively-at-work requirements or any restrictions
or limitations with respect to pre-existing conditions with respect to any
Transferred Employee or his or her spouse or dependents, to the extent that
such waiting period, requirements, restrictions or limitations did not apply
under the Seller Benefit Plans. The Purchaser shall  cause the New Welfare
Plans to credit (or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
third party administrator or insurance carrier to credit) the Transferred
Employees and their dependants and beneficiaries with any deductible, co-
payments and out-of-pocket requirements under the New Welfare Plans to the
extent of amounts previously credited for 2008 for such purposes under the
corresponding Seller Benefit Plans. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee
employment of any  Transferred Employee for any period of time after the
Closing Date or preclude the ability of the Purchaser to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee for any reason or no reason, or (ii)
require the Purchaser to continue any particular employee benefit plan or
arrangement after the Closing Date, subject in each case to applicable Law and
the terms of such employee benefits plan and arrangements.No provision of this
Section 5.06 shall create any third party  beneficiary or other rights in any
current or former employee of the Seller, the Business or Purchaser (including
any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or any other person. The Purchaser or
any of its affiliates, as applicable, shall have the right in its sole
discretion to amend, modify, terminate or adjust benefit levels under any and
all employee benefit plans and arrangements covering the Transferred Employees
after the Closing Date, subject to this Section 5.06. No  provision of

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

48

  

 

  



  

this Section 5.06 is intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit
plan or arrangement of the Seller or Purchaser or any affiliate of the Seller
or the Purchaser.

  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its affiliates to, credit service accrued by Transferred Employees with, or
otherwise recognized for benefit plan purposes by, the Seller and its
affiliates (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Seller or
any its affiliates, to the extent service with  the predecessor employer is
recognized by the Seller or any of its affiliates) as of the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing Service_ ") for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting under any employee benefit plans and arrangements and employment-
related entitlements sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Purchaser
or its affiliates to the same extent recognized by the Seller and its
affiliates immediately prior  to the Closing Date; provided, that no service
will be recognized (i) for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit
pension plan of the Purchaser or its affiliates, (ii) for eligibility purposes
under any post-retirement welfare benefit plan of the Purchaser or its
affiliates or (iii) to the extent such credit would result in duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

  

(e) The Seller shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage,
within the meaning of COBRA, in respect of any Business Employee or "qualified
beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) who incurs a "qualifying event" on or prior
to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing
continuation  coverage in respect of any Transferred Employee or qualified
beneficiary of a Transferred Employee, in each case, who incurs a qualifying
event after the Closing Date.

  

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, on and after the Closing, the Seller shall retain all liabilities,
obligations and commitments with respect to (i) the Spectrum Brands, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the Rayovac Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan, (ii) Retiree  Medical Liability, (iii) any defined benefit
pension plan, except for defined benefit pension plans set forth in _Section
5.06(f)_ of the Seller Letter, (iv) stock plans and awards granted under the
plans or arrangements of the Seller and (v) Controlled Group Liability.

  

(g) The Seller shall be responsible in accordance with its welfare plans
in effect prior to the Closing Date for all reimbursement claims (such as
medical and dental claims) for expenses incurred, and for all non-
reimbursement claims (such as life insurance and disability claims) incurred,
under any Seller Benefit Plans that are  "employee welfare benefit plans"
(within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), prior to the Closing Date by
Business Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries.

  

(h) The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser, no later than five
calendar days prior to the Closing Date, a list of all employees or former
employees of the Seller who have suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in
WARN) during the ninety calendar day period on or preceding the Closing Date
at each "single site of  employment" (as defined in WARN) and the date of
such employment loss and applicable site of employment for each such person.

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

49

  

 

  



  

(i) The Purchaser shall be responsible for any obligation or liability
under WARN with respect to "employment losses" which take place after the
Closing Date. The Seller shall be responsible for any obligation or liability
under WARN with respect to "employment losses" that take place on or prior to
the Closing  Date.

  

(j) At or immediately prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall 100% vest
all employees in the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan, the 2008 Long Term
Incentive Plan and the 2008 Management Incentive Plan (the " _Incentive Plans_
"), and (ii) the Seller shall pay all amounts due pursuant to the Incentive
Plans and shall  terminate the Incentive Plans. The Purchaser (A) shall be
liable for any and shall pay any change of control, stay bonuses, deal bonuses
and similar obligations in accordance with the terms of the agreements set
forth on _Section 5.06(j)(i)(A)_ of the Seller Letter in an amount not to
exceed $1,600,000 in the aggregate (the " _Assumed Employee Payments_ ") and
(B) shall assume and be responsible for the obligations under the severance
and other agreements  and payments set forth on _Section 5.06(j)(i)(B)_ of
the Seller Letter (the " _Assumed Severance Agreements_ "). The Purchaser
shall execute and deliver assumption and novation instruments with respect to
the Assumed Employee Payments and Assumed Severance Agreements that are
obligations of one or more of the Transferors. With respect to those employees
set forth on _Section 5.06(j)(ii) _ of the Seller Letter, in the event the
employment of  any such employee is terminated during the Continuation Period
and subject to such employee's execution of a release of claims, the Purchaser

53

  

 

  



  

any reasonable and lawful arrangements to provide to Purchaser (or its
designee) the benefits of use of the Business Portion of the Shared Contract
for its term and, to the extent Purchaser (or its designee) receives such
benefits, it will perform the obligations of the Seller or its affiliates
under the Business Portion of the Shared Contract. The Purchaser and the

SECTION 5.20.

     |  

_German Tax Matters_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) _Change of Fiscal Year_. If, after execution and delivery of this
Agreement, it turns out that Closing will not occur on July 31, 2008 and
provided the change of the fiscal year as described in Section 5.20(b) has not
yet been registered with the commercial register, Seller undertakes to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to  arrange for a change of the fiscal year
of Tetra Holding GmbH and its German subsidiaries such that it ends on the
Closing Date. The parties acknowledge that (i) pursuant to Section 5.10 any
intra company payables between the Transferred Entities and the Seller or its
affiliates shall be settled prior to the Closing Date and (ii) Spectrum Brands
Europe GmbH is likely to have an outstanding payable to Tetra GmbH prior to
the Closing Date resulting from a cash pooling agreement, which  as of April,
27, 2008 amounted to € 41,609,161. Seller and Purchaser agree that such
payable should be settled prior to the Closing Date in a cash neutral manner,
and agree to closely cooperate to cause such settlement to be in a manner that
is as tax efficient as possible for both parties. The steps currently
envisaged by the parties to be taken prior to the Closing Date and when
setting up and approving the next fiscal year end financial statements are
outlined in _Exhibit  G_ hereto.(b) The Seller shall cause the current
profit and loss transfer agreement ( _Ergebnisabf uhrungsvertrag_) between

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

55

  

 

  



  

Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH and Tetra Holding GmbH (the " _PLTA_ ") to be
terminated for cause ( _aus wichtigem Grund_ ) as per expiry of the Closing
Date (midnight German time). In addition, the Seller shall cause each of Tetra
Holding GmbH and its German subsidiaries to change its current fiscal year to
a short fiscal year ending as of July 31, 2008, _provided_ , the competent
German tax  authorities have approved such change of the fiscal year.

  

(i) (A) If the changes of the fiscal years are timely registered and
Closing occurs on July 31, 2008, the profits of Tetra Holding GmbH for the
short fiscal year ending as of the Closing Date shall be transferred to
Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH on the Closing Date on the basis of a best
estimate to be submitted by  the management of Tetra Holding GmbH. The
transfer amounts will be finally derived from the accounts of Tetra Holding
GmbH for the short fiscal year ending as of July 31, 2008, which shall be set
up and audited at the expense of the Seller within two months following the
Closing Date, at the latest. The Purchaser hereby guarantees the prompt and
full payment of the transfer amounts (to the extent such transfer amounts have
not been offset against Taxes to be borne by Spectrum Brands  Europe GmbH
pursuant to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.20(b)) by Tetra
Holding GmbH to Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH. Promptly after adoption of the
annual accounts ( _Feststellung des Jahresabschlusses_ ) of Tetra Holding
GmbH, the Seller shall cause Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH and the Purchaser
shall cause Tetra Holding GmbH, as the case may be, to pay any balancing
amount to the relevant other party of the PLTA pursuant to  and as provided
in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.20(b). The Seller (in the case
of Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH) and the Purchaser (in the case of Tetra
Holding GmbH) hereby guarantee the treatment of the balancing amount pursuant
to and as provided in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.20(b).

  

(B) If the changes of the fiscal years are timely registered, but Closing
occurs after July 31, 2008, the profits of Tetra Holding GmbH for the short
fiscal year ending as of July 31, 2008 and the profits of Tetra Holding GmbH
for the period between August, 1, 2008 and the Closing Date shall be
transferred to Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH on the Closing Date. The  relevant
profit amount for the short fiscal year shall be derived from the accounts of
Tetra Holding GmbH as of July 31, 2008, _provided_ the accounts are readily
available and audited on the Closing Date. If this is not the case, the
relevant amount shall be determined on the basis of a best estimate by the
management of Tetra Holding GmbH. The last two sentences of paragraph (A) of
this Section 5.20(b)(i) shall apply accordingly. The results of Tetra Holding
GmbH for the  period between August, 1, 2008 and the Closing Date shall be
determined on the basis of a best estimate by the management of Tetra Holding
GmbH and shall be verified by interim accounts to be set up for Tetra Holding
GmbH as per the Closing Date. The last two sentences of paragraph (A) of this
Section 5.20(b)(i) shall apply accordingly.

  

(C) If the changes of the fiscal years are not (timely) registered, the
profits of Tetra Holding GmbH for the period between October 1, 2007 and the
Closing Date shall be transferred to Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH on the
Closing Date. The relevant amount shall be determined on the basis of a best
estimate by the

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

56

  

 

  



  

management of Tetra Holding GmbH and shall be verified by interim accounts to
be set up for Tetra Holding GmbH as per the Closing Date. The last two
sentences of paragraph (A) of this Section 5.20(b)(i) shall apply accordingly.

  

(D) If the Closing does not occur until (and including) September 29, 2008,
and the changes of the fiscal years are not (timely) registered, paragraphs
(A) through (C) of this Section 5.20(b)(i) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

  

(ii) For purposes of Section 5.20(b)(i), any Taxes payable by Tetra
Holding GmbH in connection with a distribution of Tetra Holding GmbH as
outlined in _Exhibit G_ hereto shall be borne by Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH,
_provided_ , _however_ , that such amount shall be paid by Tetra Holding GmbH
to the  competent German tax authorities and that the corresponding claim of
Tetra Holding GmbH for reimbursement of such amount shall be booked to a newly
created shareholder\'s current account. The full balance of this current
account shall be offset against the claim of Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH for
the transfer of profits for the applicable period until termination of the
PLTA, and only the remaining profit transfer claim shall be paid to Spectrum
Brands Europe GmbH and taken into  account as Indebtedness for the
calculation of the Final Assumed Indebtedness Amount to the extent it exceeds
the amount effected by Tetra Holding GmbH by way of advance payment prior to
and/or at Closing. If and to the extent the amount of annual profits shown in
the audited annual accounts of Tetra Holding GmbH as of July 31, 2008 (or in
the respective interim accounts, as applicable) is higher than the amount of
the best estimate, the Purchaser shall ensure that Spectrum Brands  Europe
GmbH is entitled to the difference from Tetra Holding GmbH, which difference
shall be settled in the manner provided in paragraph (iii) of this Section
5.20(b) within two weeks after the annual accounts have become final as
outlined above. If and to the extent that the amount of annual profits shown
in the audited annual accounts of Tetra Holding GmbH as of July 31, 2008 (or
in the respective interim accounts, as applicable) is lower than the amount of
the best estimate, the  Seller shall ensure that Tetra Holding GmbH is
entitled to the difference from Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH, which difference
shall be settled in the manner provided in paragraph (iii) of this Section
5.20(b) within two weeks after the annual accounts have become final as
outlined above. If and to the extent the Taxes payable by Tetra Holding GmbH
relating to the steps described in _Exhibit G_ exceed the profit transfer
claim, Seller shall cause Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH to  promptly indemnify
Tetra Holding GmbH for any such excess.

  

(iii) In order to avoid Post-Closing cash payments, the parties assure
that any payment obligations of Tetra Holding GmbH to Spectrum Brands Europe
GmbH or of Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH to Tetra Holding GmbH under the PLTA
arising out of the fact that the amount of annual profits shown in the audited
annual accounts of Tetra  Holding GmbH as of July 31, 2008 (or in the
respective interim accounts, as applicable) is higher or lower than the amount
of the best estimate, shall be settled as follows: If Spectrum Brands Europe
GmbH has a claim against Tetra Holding GmbH, there shall be a corresponding
indemnification claim in an equal amount payable by the Purchaser to the
Seller. The parties agree that the Purchaser

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

57

  

 

  



  

shall assign this claim to Tetra Holding GmbH and that Tetra Holding GmbH
shall assign the claim to Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH in full satisfaction of
its payment obligation under the PLTA. If Tetra Holding GmbH has a claim
against Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH, there shall be a corresponding
indemnification claim in an equal amount by the Seller from the Purchaser. The
parties  agree that the Seller shall assign this claim to Spectrum Brands
Europe GmbH and that Spectrum Brands Europe GmbH shall assign the claim to
Tetra Holding GmbH in full satisfaction of its payment obligation under the
PLTA. The parties shall cause Tetra Holding GmbH and Spectrum Brands Europe
GmbH to take all necessary actions to implement this paragraph.

  

SECTION 5.21. _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller and the
members of its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take  such
actions as are reasonably necessary, if any, so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 5.22. _Record Ownership_. Each of item of Owned Intellectual Property
that is registered or pending in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, the United States Copyright Office or equivalent foreign intellectual
property registry, shall be recorded by Seller or its affiliates in such
offices as owned by a Transferred  Entity.

  

SECTION 5.23. _EBITDA Calculation_. Prior to the Closing and following receipt
of the 2007 Audited Financial Statements, the parties shall jointly calculate
the Final EBITDA Amount in good faith.

  

SECTION 5.24. _Lien Releases_. The Seller, at its expense, shall cooperate
with the Purchaser and take such action requested by the Purchaser, before and
after the Closing to obtain evidence of the release of the Liens set forth in
_Section 5.24_ of the Seller Letter.

and its affiliates that it controls shall not be prohibited from (i) making
general solicitations of employment that are not specifically targeted at
Remaining Employees or (ii) hiring any  Remaining Employee who first
initiates contact with the Purchaser or its affiliates that it controls
regarding possible future employment on his or her own initiative without any
direct solicitation by the Purchaser or any of its affiliates that it
controls.

  

(d) From the date of this Agreement through and including the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its affiliates that
it controls shall induce a Business Customer: (i) to buy from any Person
engaged in the Business other than Purchaser or its affiliates; or (ii) to
withdraw, curtail or cancel any  Business Customer's business with the
Business. As used in this Section 6.01(d), " _Business Customer_ " means any
actual customer of the Business, or any potential customer of the Business,
served or actively solicited to the knowledge of the Seller by the Business
within the twelve-month period prior to the Closing Date, in each case only
with respect to the Business.

  

(e) It is the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that
the provisions of Section 6.01(a) shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

59

  

 

  



  

laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that although the Seller and the
Purchaser consider the provisions of Section 6.01(a) to be reasonable, if a
judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is an 
unenforceable restriction against the Seller, the provisions of this Agreement
shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such
maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may
judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. If any particular
provisions or portion of Section 6.01(a) shall be adjudicated to be
unenforceable, the amendment contemplated by the immediately preceding
sentence shall apply only with respect to the  operation of such Section in
the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.

  

(f) The parties recognize that the performance of the obligations under
Section 6.01(a) by the Seller is special, unique and extraordinary in
character, and that in the event of the breach by Seller of the terms and
conditions of Section 6.01(a) to be performed by Seller, the Purchaser and its
affiliates shall be entitled, if  they so elect, to obtain damages for any
breach, or to enforce the specific performance thereof by the Seller.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.01 to the contrary, the
Seller and its affiliates it controls may acquire, directly or indirectly, any
business that is engaged in Competitive Activities, if such Competitive
Activities account for less than 15% of such business' consolidated annual
revenues and earnings before  interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
or consolidated operating income during the twelve month period preceding such
acquisition.

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Seller or any of its affiliates it controls may (i) be acquired by a non-
affiliated third party (where the stockholders of the Seller immediately prior
to the acquisition own less than a majority of the outstanding equity or
voting interests of such acquiring or combined  person) or (ii) merge with a
person set forth in Section 6.01(h) of the Seller Letter and Competitive
Activities by such acquiring person or the combined entity shall not be a
violation of this Section 6.01.

  

       



     |  

SECTION 6.02.

     |  

_Confidentiality_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it
in connection with the Acquisition, the Financing and the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
confidentiality agreement dated as of February 26, 2008 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between  HCPMF and the Seller, the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information relating to the Business.

  

(b) Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller shall
keep confidential, and cause its affiliates that it controls and their
respective advisors, consultants, employees and agents to keep confidential,
all information relating to the Business following the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any  information that is a trade secret
under applicable Law such confidentiality obligation shall survive for so long
as such

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

60

  

 

  



  

information remains a trade secret. The provisions of this Section 6.02(b)
shall not apply to the disclosure by the Seller or its affiliates that it
controls of any information, documents or materials which (i) are or become
publicly available, other than by reason of a breach of this 6.02(b) by Seller
or any of its affiliates that it controls or (ii) is required by applicable
Law to  be disclosed, but then only (A) to the extent disclosure is required
and (B) after notifying the Purchaser of such obligation and using
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Purchaser's expense, to seek a
protective order or other similar or appropriate relief.

  

SECTION 6.03. _Publicity_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Acquisition, and
shall not, and shall not permit  their subsidiaries to, issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form  heretofore agreed to by
the parties.

  

       



     |  

SECTION 6.04.

     |  

_Post-Closing Cooperation_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand,
shall cooperate with each other in good faith, and shall cause their
affiliates that they control and their Representatives to cooperate with each
other, after the Closing to facilitate the orderly transition of the Business
to the Purchaser after the Closing and to  minimize any disruption to the
Business that might result from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. This cooperation shall include cooperating to change the
Environmental Protection Agency establishment number for the Seller's
Corporate Exchange facility in St. Louis, MO to a number issued to UPG. After
the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, the Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Seller, on the other hand, shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
the other  and the other's affiliates and their Representatives access,
during normal business hours, to such books, records, manuals and other
information and assistance relating to the Business or any Transferred Entity
(to the extent within the control of such party) as is reasonably necessary
for financial reporting, accounting and Tax matters or other reasonable
purposes.

  

(b) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand,
shall reimburse the other for reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this Section 6.04.
Neither party shall be required by this Section 6.04 to take any action that
would unreasonably interfere with the  conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of the Purchaser,
those of the Business).

  

SECTION 6.05. _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing, as
and when reasonably requested by any party, the other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents,
conveyances,

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

61

  

 

  



  

assurances and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as such party may reasonably require to confirm and
assure the rights and obligations provided for in this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, in the
case of the Seller, executing and delivering to the Purchaser such
assignments, deeds, bills of sale,  consents and other instruments as the
Purchaser may reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

agreements, instruments and other documentation to be delivered by the Seller
or its affiliates pursuant to Section 1.03.

     |  

(i)

     |  

by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(ii) by Seller, if Purchaser breaches or fails to perform in any respect
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03 or constitutes a failure
to pay  the Purchase Price when it is otherwise due and owing, (B) has not
been cured within thirty (30) days following delivery of written notice
thereof to Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Cure Period_ "); provided, however,
that such cure period shall not apply to Purchaser's obligation to pay the
Purchase Price at the Closing if all other conditions to the Closing (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be  satisfied at Closing)
have been satisfied and (C) has not been waived by Seller;

  

(iii) by Purchaser, if Seller breaches or fails to perform in any respect
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in

(v) by Purchaser, if Purchaser may not otherwise terminate this
Agreement pursuant to any other provision of this Section 8.01(a), if the

_provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause
(ii) or (iii) is not then in material breach of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, it being understood that (i) Purchaser
Non-Material Covenant Failures shall not be deemed to be breaches that would
prevent  Purchaser from exercising its termination rights pursuant to

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

65

  

 

  



  

Section 8.01(a)(iii) and (ii) Seller Non-Material Covenant Failures shall not

been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(ii),
assuming the Purchaser Cure Period, if applicable, had expired; (iii) in the
case of termination by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(iii), Purchaser

the case of termination by Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(iv), Purchaser
shall be entitled to the Expense Reimbursement, if applicable, and (v) in the

perform by Purchaser of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or any agreement entered into in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby at or prior to Closing,
whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to any provision
hereof, Seller's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to terminate this
Agreement  pursuant to, and as permitted by, Section 8.01(a)(ii) with the
effect described in Section 8.02(b) and subject to the limitations

set forth in Section 8.02(c) and (y) in no event shall Purchaser or Harbinger
be subject to any liability in excess of the Liquidated Damages for any losses
or damages relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by (i) Purchaser pursuant
to Section 8.01(a)(v) and, at the time of such termination, Seller would have
otherwise been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(a)(ii), assuming the Purchaser Cure Period, if applicable, had expired,
or (ii) Seller  pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(ii), Purchaser shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) as Seller's sole
and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by Purchaser of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement (the " _Liquidated Damages_ ") and such Liquidated Damages shall be
Seller's sole and exclusive remedy and  shall be in lieu of any other
remedies at law or in equity to which Seller might otherwise be entitled,
including on account of punitive damages. The payment of the Liquidated
Damages shall be made (i) on the date of such termination by the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(v), if, at the time of such termination, Seller
would have otherwise been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(a)(ii), assuming the Purchaser Cure Period, if  applicable, had
expired, or (ii) within three (3) Business Days following the date of such
termination if terminated by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(ii). The
Liquidated Damages shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Seller and, if not timely paid as described
in the immediately preceding sentence, shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the " _prime  rate_ ," as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, in effect from time to time or, if less, the maximum rate
permitted by applicable Law, calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year
and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding. In addition, if
the Purchaser shall fail to pay the Liquidated Damages when due, the Purchaser
shall also pay to the Seller all of the Seller's costs and expenses (including
reasonable  attorneys' fees) in connection with the Seller's efforts to
collect the Liquidated Damages. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the Liquidated Damages, plus any interest accrued and payable thereon, are to
be paid by Purchaser to compensate Seller for such damages as liquidated
damages, and that any and all amounts paid pursuant to this Section 8.02(b)
represent liquidated damages and not a penalty.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for the
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that,
except in the event of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement:

  

(i) Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of this Agreement
by Purchaser at or prior to Closing, including any failure of, or refusal by,
Purchaser to pay the Purchase Price for any reason whatsoever or any failure
of, or refusal by, Purchaser to consummate the Financing, obtain the
proceeds  thereof or otherwise have available sufficient funds or Notes to
pay the Purchase Price, shall be (A) to obtain Liquidated Damages as described
in Section 8.02(b) in the event of a termination of this Agreement by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.0l(a)(v) in the event that, at the time of
such termination, Seller would have otherwise been entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(ii), assuming the Purchaser Cure Period,
if applicable,  had expired, or (B) to terminate this Agreement pursuant

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

67

  

 

  



  

to, and as permitted by, the terms of Section 8.01(a)(ii) and to obtain
Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 8.02(b); and

  

(ii) Seller shall not pursue any other remedies or actions, at law or in
equity, and hereby waives any and all other remedies against Purchaser (and
its affiliates) in respect thereof.

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser or
the Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(iv) and at the time of termination the
condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) has not been satisfied but the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(b) and 7.03 have been satisfied
(other than such  conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing), then the Seller shall reimburse Purchaser and Harbinger for their
respective out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby (including potential debt
financing therefor) up to the aggregate amount set forth in _Section 8.02_ of
the Seller Letter for Purchaser and Harbinger taken together (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ ") as  promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event
within three (3) business days following such termination) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

  

SECTION 8.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. By
an instrument in writing the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the
other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of
this Agreement that such other  party was or is obligated to comply with or
perform. Any such waiver shall only be effective in the specific instance and
for the specific and limited purpose for which it was given and shall not be
deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement or of the same breach
or default upon any recurrence thereof. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise and no delay in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise  of any right
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right.

arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of (i) except as provided in

5.04(b), (iv) any Taxes in connection with the 338 Elections for

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

68

  

 

  



  

which the Seller is liable under Section 5.05(h), (v) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Seller contained in Section 3.12 of this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section
7.02(d), and (vi) any breach of any covenant of the Seller contained in
Section 5.01(b)(xviii) or Section 5.05.

  

(b) From and after the Closing, except and only to the extent otherwise
included in the calculation of the Final Working Capital, the Purchaser and
the Transferred Entities shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Seller,
its affiliates and each of their stockholders, members, partners and
Representatives (the  " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") and hold them harmless from
any Losses arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of (i) any Taxes
imposed on the Business with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any
Taxes that may be imposed on the Business as a result of being a member of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of corporations or other
taxpayers at any time after the Closing Date,  (iii) any Transfer Taxes for
which the Purchaser is liable under Section 5.04(b) and (iv) any breach by the
Purchaser or any of its affiliates of any covenant contained in Section 5.05.

  

(c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "):

  

(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ")
of the Business for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period on a _pro rata_ basis (based on the  number of days during
such taxable period elapsed on or prior to the Closing Date). If at the time
of Closing, the tax rate or the assessed valuation for the year in which the
Closing occurs has not yet been fixed, Property Taxes shall be prorated based
upon the tax rate and the assessed valuation established for the previous tax
year; and

  

(ii) the Taxes of the Business (other than Property Taxes) for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

  

(d) To the extent that any indemnification provided for in this Section
9.01 may overlap or conflict with any indemnification contained in Section
9.02, the Seller shall not be required to duplicate the indemnification for
the same Losses under both Section 9.01 and Sections 9.02.

  

SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification by the Seller_. From and after the Closing, the
Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against, and hold them
harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, obligation, damage or expense,
including reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses, which shall include, for
the avoidance of doubt, all  reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses of
enforcing a Purchaser Indemnitee's rights pursuant to this Article IX
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), suffered or incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnitees (without duplication for (i) any indemnification provided for in
Section 9.01(a) and (ii) any indemnification that may be sought under more
than one clause of this Section 9.02) arising from, relating  to or otherwise
in respect of:

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

69

  

 

  



  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller contained
in Articles II or III of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the
Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

  

(b) any breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement of the Seller
contained in this Agreement;

  

(c) any Transaction Expenses incurred or owed by the Seller or any
Transferred Entity in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

  

(d) any failure to obtain the consent set forth in _Section 3.04(C)(a)_
of the Seller Letter.

  

SECTION 9.03. _Threshold; Cap; _De_ _Minimis__. The Seller shall not be
required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee, and shall not have any
liability:

  

(a) under clause (a) of Section 9.02 unless the aggregate of all Losses
for which the Seller would, but for this clause (a), be liable thereunder
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to nine million one hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($9,150,000) (the " _Basket Amount_ ") and then only to
the extent  of any such excess; _provided_ , that any and all breaches of the
Class 1 Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.20 shall not be subject to the Basket Amount, but instead shall be
recoverable in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis; and

  

(b) under clause (a) of Section 9.02 in excess of one hundred fourteen
million three hundred seventy five thousand dollars ($114,375,000) (the "
_Cap_ ") _provided_ , that any and all breaches of the Class 1 Representations
and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.20 shall not
be  subject to the Cap.

  

SECTION 9.04. _Survival of Representations; Covenants; Agreements_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the representations and
warranties in Articles II, III and IV (other than the Class I Representations
and Sections 3.12, 3.14  and 3.17 and the last sentence of Section 3.20 )
shall survive until the fifteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, (b) the
Class I Representations shall survive indefinitely, (c) the representations
and warranties in Section 3.17 shall survive until the three year anniversary
of the Closing Date, (d) the representations and warranties in Section 3.12,
Section 3.14 and the last sentence of Section 3.20 shall survive for 60 days 
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (after
giving effect to any extension thereof), it being agreed that with respect to
the representations in Section 3.12, in respect of any German Entities such
period shall not expire before the expiration of a limitation period of six
months after the final binding and unchangeable assessment ( _endg ultig
bestandskraftige und nicht mehr anderbare  Festsetzung_) of the relevant Tax,
(e) the covenants contained in Sections 6.01(a), 6.01(b) and 6.01(c) shall
survive until the fourth, second and second anniversaries of the Closing Date,
respectively, of the Closing Date,

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

70

  

 

  



  

and (f) all other covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive
indefinitely or otherwise in accordance with their terms.

SECTION 9.05.

     |  

_Termination of Indemnification; Other Limitations_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any person (i)
pursuant to Section 9.01 and subject to Section 9.04(d), with respect to the
German Entities (in any such case the determining date under this clause (i)
shall be six months following the final binding and unchangeable assessment (
_endg ultig  bestandskraftige und nicht mehr anderbare Festsetzung_) of the
applicable Tax), shall terminate 60 days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (after giving effect to any extension
thereof), (ii) pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or 9.07(a) shall terminate when the
applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 9.04,
(iii) pursuant to Section 9.02(b) or Section 9.07(b) shall terminate 90 days
after  the applicable covenant terminates pursuant to Section 9.04 and (iv)
pursuant to the other clauses of Section 9.02 and Section 9.07 shall not
terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the
person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim pursuant
to  Section 9.09 to the party providing the indemnification.

  

(b) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Loss in connection
with a claim by any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Seller for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this Article IX, all "material adverse effect" and other
materiality references in the  representations and warranties set forth in
Article II and Article III, as applicable, shall be disregarded other than the
references set forth in Sections 3.05(a), 3.05(b), 3.15(a), 3.21(a) and 3.22.

  

SECTION 9.06. _Exclusive Monetary Remedy; Consequential Damages; Nature of
Payments; No Duplicate Recovery_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or in
the Transition Services Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge
that their exclusive monetary remedy after the Closing with respect to any
claims relating to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Business and its assets and  liabilities (other than for
fraud or criminal activity) shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
of the Purchaser and the Seller, for itself and its affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities), waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud)
for  monetary damages it may have against the other or its affiliates arising
under this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection
herewith, any applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX.

  

(b) Neither the Purchaser, any Transferred Entity nor the Seller shall
be liable or otherwise responsible to any other person for lost profits, lost
revenues, lost

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

71

  

 

  



  

opportunity costs, costs of financing or indirect, consequential, punitive,
special, or incidental damages arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the performance or breach
of this Agreement or any liability or obligation retained or assumed under
this Agreement except to the extent such damages are an element of a Third
Party Claim against  the Purchaser, any Transferred Entity or the Seller
which is the object of indemnification hereunder.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, no indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article IX with respect to any Loss to the extent that such Loss was
specifically reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 1.04.

  

SECTION 9.07. _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. From and after the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, and hold each of them harmless from,
any Loss suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnities (without duplication
for (i) any indemnification  provided for in Section 9.01(b) and (ii) any
indemnification that may be sought under more than one clause of this Section
9.07) arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of:

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser
contained in Article IV of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement; or

  

(b) any breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement.

  

SECTION 9.08. _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies with
respect to such Loss. In any case where the Purchaser or its subsidiaries
recovers from third parties any amount  in respect of a matter with respect
to which an indemnifying party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article IX,
such indemnified party shall promptly pay over to the indemnifying party the
amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of any amount
previously so paid by the indemnifying party to or on behalf of the
indemnified party in respect of such matter.

SECTION 9.09.

     |  

_Procedures_.

     |  

(a)

     |  

_Third Party Claims_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(i) In order for a person (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled
to any indemnification provided for under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07 in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any person against the
indemnified party (a  " _Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the
Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such indemnified party of
notice of the Third Party Claim; provided,

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

72

  

 

  



  

however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except and only to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified party's receipt
thereof,  copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof by written notice to the
indemnified party within 10 days of the receipt of the notice received
pursuant to  Section 9.09(a)(i) with counsel selected by the indemnifying
party; _provided_ that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the
indemnified party; _provided_ , _further_ , that such written notice given
after 10 days will be valid except and only to the extent the indemnified
party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall
not be entitled to assume  control of such defense and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (reasonably acceptable to the
indemnifying party) retained by the indemnified party if (i) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegations or investigation; (ii) the claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party; (iii)
the indemnified party reasonably believes upon advice of  counsel that an
adverse determination with respect to the action, lawsuit, investigation,
proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification would
have a material adverse effect on the Business; (iv) the indemnifying party
failed or is failing to prosecute or defend such claim; or (v) if the claim is
subject to the Cap and such claim together with all outstanding and unresolved
claims that are subject to the Cap could reasonably be expected to  give rise
to Losses which are more than 150% of the remaining amount indemnifiable by
such indemnifying party with respect to such claims pursuant to this Article
IX. Should the indemnifying party be entitled and so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying
party assumes  such defense in accordance with this Agreement, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the
fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any
period during which the indemnifying party has not  assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the indemnified party is
delinquent in giving notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above) and
with respect to any Third Party Claim where the indemnifying party was
prohibited from assuming such defense pursuant to this Section 9.09. If the
indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the
indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such  cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
information

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

73

  

 

  



  

that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. No party shall compromise or
settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or 
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such compromise or settlement
relates only to monetary amounts and provides for the full and unconditional
release of the Purchaser Indemnitees from all liability in connection with
such claim, then the Seller may settle such claim without the Purchaser's
consent as long as the Seller pays in full the amount required to settle such
Third Party Claim and the settlement of such claim does not contain an
admission of wrongdoing on  the part of any Purchaser Indemnitee. All claims
under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07 other than Third Party Claims shall be
governed by Section 9.09(b).

  

(b) _Other Claims_. If any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07 that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall  promptly
deliver notice of such claim to the indemnifying party after obtaining
knowledge of such claim. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07,
except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been actually
prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party do not  agree within 30 calendar days following the indemnifying
party's receipt of such notice with respect to such claim under Section 9.02
or Section 9.07 (as such period may be extended by mutual agreement), then the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party may pursue the remedies available
under this Agreement.

_Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(i) Promptly after a party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") becomes
aware of the existence of a Tax issue that may give rise to an indemnification
claim under Section 9.01 (a " _Tax  Controversy_ ") by it against the other
party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), the Tax Indemnified Party shall
notify the Tax Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue and thereafter shall
promptly forward to the Tax Indemnifying Party copies of the relevant portion
of any notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority and
communications with any Taxing Authority relating to such Tax  Controversy;
provided, however, that a failure to give such notice will not affect such
other party's rights to indemnification under this Article IX, except to the
extent that such party is actually prejudiced thereby. Any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in handling, settling or contesting a Tax Controversy shall
be borne by the Tax Indemnifying Party.

  

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.09(c)(ii), after the
Closing Date (except in the case of any Tax Controversy relating to a Tax
Return of any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Transferred
Entities were members (a " _Pre-Closing Consolidated  Return_ ")), the
Purchaser shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of
any Tax Controversy with respect

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

 

  

74

  

 

  



  

to any of the Transferred Entities. In the case of a Contest after the Closing
Date that relates solely to Taxes for which the Purchaser is indemnified under
9.01(a) (including any Pre-Closing Consolidated Returns), the Seller may elect
to control the handling, settling or contesting of any such Tax Controversy,
but the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in such Tax 
Controversy (except in the case of a Tax Controversy that relates to a Pre-
Closing Consolidated Return) at its own expense. The Seller shall not settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Controversy (except in the
case of a Tax Controversy that relates to a Pre-Closing Consolidated Return)
without obtaining the Purchaser's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the case of a Tax
Controversy that  relates both to Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnified
under Section 9.01(a) and Taxes for which Seller is indemnified under 9.01(b),
the Purchaser shall control the conduct of such Tax Controversy, but the
Seller shall have the right to participate in such Tax Controversy at its own
expense, and the Purchaser shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such
Tax Controversy without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld,  delayed or conditioned. The Tax
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified Party reasonably informed as
to the progress of any Tax proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy to the
extent such Tax proceeding relates to Taxes payable by or with respect to the
Transferred Entities and shall consider in good faith any written comments or
suggestions regarding such Tax proceeding from the Tax Indemnified Party.

SECTION 10.08.

     |  

_Consent to Jurisdiction_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of or relating to  this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each
party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any

jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

  

(b) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement in any court referred to in the  first sentence of
paragraph (a) of this Section 10.08. Each party irrevocably and

(c) Each party consents, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable

by jury in respect to any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of

SECTION 10.12. _Specific Performance_. Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees
that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by Seller, that Purchaser would suffer irreparable harm as a result
of any such breach, and that, in addition to all other remedies available
under this Agreement or at law or in  equity, Purchaser shall be entitled to
seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy
for any such breach or threatened breach, without posting any bond, security
or other undertaking in the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in
New York County (and, if such Supreme Court of the State of New York shall be
unavailable, in any other New York State court or in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of  New York), and any appellate
court from any thereof. In the event of any action by Purchaser to enforce
this Agreement, Seller hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that money damages
would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach by Purchaser of Sections 5.05
(but only in respect of matters after the Closing), 5.06 (but only in respect
of matters after the Closing), 5.09(a), 5.09(c) (but only in  respect of

Closing), 6.02, 6.03, 6.04 (but only in respect of matters after the Closing)
and 6.05 (but only in respect of matters after the Closing) that Seller would
suffer  irreparable harm as a result of any such breach, and that, in
addition to all other remedies available under this Agreement or at law or in
equity, Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive
or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened
breach, without posting any bond, security or other undertaking in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County (and, if such
Supreme Court of the State of  New York shall be unavailable, in any other
New York

State court or in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York), and any appellate court from any thereof. In the event of any
action by Seller to enforce Sections 5.05 (but only in respect of matters
after the Closing), 5.06 (but only in respect of matters after the Closing),
5.09(a), 5.09(c) (but only in respect of matters after the Closing), 5.15 (but

of matters after the Closing), 6.01(f) (but only in respect of matters after
the Closing), 6.02, 6.03, 6.04 (but only in respect of matters after the
Closing) and 6.05 (but only in respect of matters after the Closing),
Purchaser hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.
For the avoidance of doubt, except as specifically provided above, Seller
shall not be entitled to specific performance or  injunctive relief as a
remedy under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

be included in computing the Purchase Price or Working Capital. In addition,
none of the representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Seller in this Agreement shall apply to ASMIO except for Sections 1.03(a),
2.04 and this Section 10.14.
