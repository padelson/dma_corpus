"Agreement"), by and between  MID-AMERICA  BANCSHARES, INC., a Tennessee

  WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror and Target have  approved,
and deem it advisable and in the best interests of  their respective
corporations and shareholders to consummate the  strategic business
combination transaction provided for herein  in which Target will, subject to
the terms and conditions set  forth herein, merge with and into Acquiror
(the  " _Merger_ "), so that Acquiror is the surviving  corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity  as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") in the Merger; 

  



  

  WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror and Target have  each
determined that the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated hereby
are consistent with, and in furtherance of,  their respective business
strategies and goals; 

  



  

  WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,  warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the  Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the  Merger; and 

  



  

  WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that  the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions  of Section 368(a) of

parties intend,  by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization  within the meaning of Treasury  Regulation Section

amount of Merger  Consideration (as defined below) to be provided to holders
of  Target Common Stock (as defined below) as provided for in this 
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of  holders of Target
Common Stock as a result of receiving the  Merger Consideration or (iii)

holder of any of  the following securities: 

  



  

  (a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_, each share of  the common stock, $1.00
par value per share, of Target (the  " _Target Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time together with those 
restricted shares of Target Common Stock set forth in  _Section 1.4(a)_ of
the Target Disclosure Schedule (as  defined below) which are not issued and
outstanding as of the  Effective Time, except for Target Bancorp Dissenting
Shares (as  defined below), shares of Target Common Stock owned by Target
or  Acquiror (other than shares of Target Common Stock held in trust 
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a  fiduciary
capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties  (any such shares held
in a fiduciary capacity by Target or  Acquiror, as the case may be, being
referred to herein as  " _Trust Account Shares_")) or shares of  Target
Common Stock held on account of a debt previously  contracted (" _DPC Shares_
"), shall be converted  into the right to receive (i) 0.4655 shares (the  "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock,  $1.00 par value per share, of
Acquiror (the  " _Acquiror Common Stock_ ") together with cash in  lieu of
any fractional shares in accordance with the provisions  of _Section 2.2(e)_
of this Agreement (the  " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) $1.50 in  cash,
without interest (the " _Cash  Consideration_ " and together with the Stock 
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

  



  

  (b) All of the shares of Target Common Stock converted into  the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Article I_ shall no
longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist as of the  Effective Time, and each certificate previously
representing any  such shares of Target Common Stock (each, a  "
_Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only  the right to receive (i) a
certificate representing the  Stock Consideration in whole shares of Acquiror
Common Stock  together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to  _Section 2,2(e)_; and (ii) the Cash Consideration  deliverable with
respect to the shares represented by such  Certificate, into which the shares
of Target Common Stock  represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to  this _Section 1.4_ and _Section 2.2(e)_.  Certificates
previously representing shares of Target Common  Stock, other than shares of
Target Common Stock owned by Target  or Acquiror (other than Trust Account
Shares and DPC  Shares) or Target Bancorp Dissenting Shares, shall be
exchanged  for (i) certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror 
Common Stock, equal to the Stock Consideration, together with  any cash in
lieu of fractional shares; and (ii) the Cash  Consideration in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of  such Certificates in accordance with _Section
2.2_,  without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time,  the
outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Target Common  Stock shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or  exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities  as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization,  reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock  split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate  and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio  per share
payable pursuant to this Agreement. 

  



  

  (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital  Stock (as defined below) that
are owned by Target or Acquiror  (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC
Shares) shall be  cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no Merger
Consideration  shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  



  

  (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, shares of
Target Common Stock which are outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective
Time and with respect to  which dissenters rights shall have been properly
demanded  in accordance with  Sections 48-23-201,  et. seq. of the TBCA ("
_Target Bancorp Dissenting  Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to  receive, or to be exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration  but,
instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment  of the appraised
value of such Target Bancorp Dissenting Shares  in accordance with the
provisions of  Sections 48-23-201,  et. seq. of the TBCA; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  (i) if any holder of Target Bancorp Dissenting Shares
shall  subsequently deliver a written withdrawal of his demand for 
appraisal of such shares, or (ii) if any holder fails to  establish his
entitlement to dissenters rights as provided  in  Sections 48-23-201,  et.
seq. of the TBCA, such holder or holders (as the case may  be) shall forfeit
the right to appraisal of such shares of  Target Common Stock and each of
such shares shall thereupon be  deemed to have been converted into the right
to receive, and to  have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the  Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as provided  in
_Sections 1.4(a)_ and _1.4(b)_ and  _Article II_ hereof. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  1.5 _Acquiror Capital Stock_. At and after  the Effective Time, each share
of Acquiror Capital Stock (as  defined below) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Closing Date shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not  be affected by the Merger. 

  



  

  1.6 _Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. 

  



  

  (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then  outstanding option to
purchase shares of Target Common Stock  (each a " _Target Stock Option_ ")
and stock  appreciation right to be settled in shares of Target Common 
Stock (each a "Target SAR") issued pursuant to the  equity-based compensation
plans identified in  _Section 4.11_ of the Target Disclosure Schedule (the 
" _Target Stock Plans_ ") to any current or former  employee or director of,
or consultant to, Target or any of its  Subsidiaries, as defined below, shall
be assumed by Acquiror and  shall be converted automatically into an option
to purchase a  number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded to the 
nearest whole share) in the case of a Target Stock Option (an  "Assumed Stock
Option") or a stock appreciation right  to be settled in shares of Acquiror
Common Stock (rounded to the  nearest whole share) in the case of a stock
appreciation right  (an "Asssumed SAR") as the case may be, at an exercise 
price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the  terms of
the Target Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing  the options or stock
appreciation rights thereunder): 

  



  

  (i) The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be  subject to the
Assumed Stock Option or Assumed SAR shall be  equal to the product of the
number of shares of Target Common  Stock subject to the Target Stock Option
or Target SAR, as the  case may be, and the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that
any  fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock resulting from such 
multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole  share; and 

  



  

  (ii) The exercise price per share of Acquiror Common Stock  under the
Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to (A) the  exercise price per share of
Target Common Stock under the Target  Stock Option less the Cash
Consideration per share, divided by  (B) the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that
such exercise price  shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. The exercise
price  per share of Acquiror Common Stock under the Assumed SAR shall  be
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of the Target  Common Stock under
the Target SAR less the Cash Consideration  per share, divided by (B) the
Exchange Ratio, _provided _ that such exercise price shall be rounded to the
nearest  whole cent. 

  



  

  In the case of any Target Stock Option to which Section 421  of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under  Section 422 of the Code, the
conversion formula shall be  adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section
424(a) of  the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock 
Options and Assumed SARs shall be subject to the same terms and  conditions
(including expiration date, vesting and exercise  provisions) as were
applicable to the corresponding Target Stock  Options or Target SARs
immediately prior to the Effective Time  (but taking into account any changes
thereto, including the  acceleration of vesting thereof, provided for in the
Target  Stock Plans or other Target Benefit Plan, as defined below, or  in
any award agreement thereunder by reason of this Agreement or  the
transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that  references to
Target shall be deemed to be references to  Acquiror. 

  



  

  (b) Acquiror has taken all corporate action necessary to  reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror  Common Stock upon the
exercise of the Assumed Stock Options and  Assumed SARs. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the  Closing Date, Acquiror shall file a
registration statement on an  appropriate form or a post-effective amendment
to a previously  filed registration statement under the Securities Act
(defined  below) with respect to the issuance of the shares of Acquiror 
Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options and Assumed  SARs and shall
use its reasonable efforts consistent with  customary industry standards to
maintain the effectiveness of  such registration statement or registration
statements (and  maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses  contained therein) for so long as such equity awards remain 
outstanding. 

  



  

  1.7 _Charter_. Subject to the terms and  conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, the Charter  of Acquiror, as then amended (the "
_Acquiror  Charter_ "), shall be the Charter of the Surviving  Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with  applicable law. 

  



  

  1.8 _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms and  conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, the Bylaws  of Acquiror, as then amended (the "Bylaws"),

 ##### 

  

  

  1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that  the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within  the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that
this  Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization"  for the
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

  



  

  1.10 _Certain Post-Closing Matters_. 

  



  

  (a) __Board Composition_._ At the  Effective Time, and continuing until
Acquirors next  shareholders meeting following the Effective Time, three

Target shall submit the names of three Current  Target Directors to the
nominating and corporate governance  committee of Acquiror for consideration
of nomination to fill  three vacancies created by the Board of Directors of
the  Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time. The nominating  and
corporate governance committee of Acquirors Board of  Directors shall
promptly meet to consider the nominations of  such persons to fill such
vacancies and shall nominate such  persons at such meeting if such persons
are reasonably  acceptable candidates to serve on the Board of Directors of
the  Surviving Corporation. The Board of Directors of Acquiror shall 
thereafter promptly meet to consider the appointment of such  persons and
shall appoint such persons unless a majority of the  members of the
Acquirors Board of Directors shall disagree  with the conclusions of the
nominating and corporate governance  committee. In the event the nominating
and corporate governance  committee or the Board of Directors of Acquiror
objects to a  nominee, the nominating and corporate governance committee of 
Targets Board of Directors shall propose additional  nominees for

   DELIVERY OF  MERGER CONSIDERATION   

  



  

  2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration. _At  or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall  deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
a bank or trust  company reasonably acceptable to each of Target and
Acquiror  (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the  holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this  _Article II_, the Cash
Consideration, certificates  representing the shares of Acquiror Common Stock
constituting  the Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional 
shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Acquiror Common  Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect  thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange  Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant
to  _Section 1.4_ and paid pursuant to  _Section 1.4_ and _Section 2.2(e)_
in  exchange for outstanding shares of Target Common Stock. 

  



  

  2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

  



  

  (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five  business
days, after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent  shall mail to each holder
of record of one or more Certificates  a letter of transmittal in customary
form as reasonably agreed  by the parties (which shall specify that delivery
shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall 
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange  Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of  the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon  proper surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate or  Certificates for exchange and cancellation,
together with such  properly 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in such form  as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such  Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in  exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) the Merger  Consideration that such holder of Target Common
Stock shall have  become entitled pursuant to the provisions of  _Article
I_; and (ii) a check representing the  amount of any dividends or
distributions that such holder is  entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)_, and  the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith  be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash or 
on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of 
Certificates. 

  



  

  (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with  respect to Acquiror
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of  any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of  Acquiror Common Stock represented thereby
until the holder  thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this  _Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate in  accordance with
this _Article II_, the record holder  thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other  distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore  had become payable with respect to shares of Acquiror
Common  Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  



  

  (c) If any certificate representing shares of Acquiror  Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which  the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor  is or are registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance  thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered  shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate 
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for  transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay  to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes  required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing  shares of Acquiror Common Stock in any name other
than that of  the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates 
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall  establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent  that such tax has been paid or
is not payable. 

  



  

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers  on the stock
transfer books of Target of the shares of Target  Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time,  certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer  to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for 
the Merger Consideration. 

  



  

  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares  of Acquiror Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for  exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with  respect to Acquiror Common Stock shall be
payable on or with  respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share  interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any 
other rights of a shareholder of Acquiror. In lieu of the  issuance of any
such fractional share, Acquiror shall pay to  each former shareholder of
Target who otherwise would be  entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash  determined by multiplying (i) the average of the  closing-
sale prices of Acquiror Common Stock on the securities  market or stock
exchange in which the Acquiror Common Stock  principally trades, as reported
by _The Wall Street  Journal_ for the five (5) trading days immediately 
preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the  fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when  expressed in decimal form) of
Acquiror Common Stock to which  such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to  _Section 1.4_. 

  



  

  (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed  by the
shareholders of Target as of the first anniversary of the  Effective Time
shall be paid to Acquiror. Any former  shareholders of Target who have not
theretofore complied with  this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to 
Acquiror for payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid  dividends
and distributions on the Acquiror Common Stock  deliverable in respect of
each share of Target Common Stock such  shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in  each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, none of Target, Acquiror, the Exchange Agent
or any  other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of 
Target Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a  public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar
laws. 

  



  

  (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,  stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that  fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen  or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Acquiror, the  posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Acquiror may  determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim  that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,  the
Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in  exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

items  the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in 
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a  provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more  representations or warranties
contained in this  _Article III_ or to one or more of Acquirors  covenants
contained in _Article V_, provided, however,  that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the  contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set
forth in  such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if 
its absence would not result in the related representation or  warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard  established by _Section 9.2_,

a  representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that  such
item represents a material exception or material fact,  event or circumstance
or that such item has had or would be  reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined  below) on Acquiror), Acquiror hereby represents
and warrants to  Target as follows:

corporate power and authority to own  or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its  business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly licensed or  qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the  nature of the business conducted by it or the character or  location of
the properties and assets owned or leased by it  makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where  the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either  individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect  on Acquiror. As used in this Agreement, the term  "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, (A) with  respect to Target, a material
adverse effect on (i) the  business, operations, results of operations,
financial condition  or prospects of Target and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or  (ii) the ability of Target to timely consummate the  transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) with respect to  Acquiror, a material adverse
effect on (i) the business,  operations, results of operations, financial
condition or  prospects of Acquiror and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or  (ii) the ability of Acquiror to timely consummate the  transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that  with respect to clause
(A)(i) and B(i) the following shall not  be deemed to have a Material Adverse
Effect: any change or event  caused by or resulting from (I) changes in
prevailing  interest rates, currency exchange rates or other economic or 
monetary conditions in the United States or elsewhere,  (II) changes in
United States or foreign securities  markets, including changes in price
levels or trading volumes,  (III) changes or events, after the date hereof,
affecting  the financial services industry generally and not specifically 
relating to Acquiror or Target or their respective Subsidiaries,  as the case
may be, (IV) changes, after the date hereof, in  generally accepted
accounting principles or regulatory  accounting requirements applicable to
banks or savings  associations and their holding companies generally,  (V)

applicability or interpretations thereof  by any Governmental Entity (as
defined below), (VI) actions  or omissions of Acquiror or Target taken with
the prior written  consent of the other or required hereunder, (VII) the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of  the
transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement  thereof, or (H) any
outbreak of major hostilities in which  the United States is involved or any
act of terrorism within the  United States or directed against its facilities
or citizens  wherever located; and provided, further, that in no event
shall  a change in the trading prices of a partys capital stock,  by
itself, be considered material or constitute a Material  Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (b) Acquiror is a bank holding company registered under the  Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC  Act_ "). True and complete
copies of the Acquirors  Charter and Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of

to do business and in  good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state,  local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or  the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and  in which the
failure to be so qualified would have a Material  Adverse Effect on Acquiror
and (iii) has all requisite  corporate or other power and authority to own or
lease its  properties and assets and to carry on its business as now 
conducted, except to the extent that the failure to have such  power or
authority will not result in a 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. As used in this Agreement,  the word
" _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to  any party means any bank, savings
bank, corporation,  partnership, limited liability company, or other
organization,  whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated  with such party for financial reporting purposes under GAAP.

binding  obligations of Acquiror, enforceable against Acquiror in 
accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by  bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar  laws affecting the rights
of creditors generally and the  availability of equitable remedies). 

  



  

  (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Acquiror of this  Agreement nor

that the consents and approvals referred to in  _Section 3.4_ are duly
obtained, (x) violate any  statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,

Lien upon any of the respective properties or  assets of Acquiror or any of

note, bond, mortgage,  indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or
other  instrument or obligation to which Acquiror or any of its 
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their  respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except  (in the case of clause
(ii) above) for such violations,  conflicts, breaches or defaults which,
either individually or in  the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse
Effect on  Acquiror.

  3.5 _Reports_. Acquiror and each of its  Subsidiaries have timely filed
all reports, registrations and  statements, together with any amendments
required to be made  with respect thereto, that they were required to file
since  January 1, 2002 with (i) the Federal Reserve Board,  (ii) the Federal

required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or  regulations of the
United States, any state, or any Regulatory  Agency, and have paid all fees
and assessments due and payable  in connection therewith, except where the
failure to file such  report, registration or statement or to pay such fees
and  assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, will not  have a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. Except for normal  examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary  course of the business of
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, no  Regulatory Agency has initiated any
proceeding or, to the  knowledge of Acquiror, investigation into the business
or  operations of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries since  January 1,
2002, except where such proceedings or  investigation will not, either
individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. There is no  unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory  Agency with respect to any report or statement (written or
oral)  relating to any examinations of Acquiror or any of its  Subsidiaries
which, either individually or in the aggregate,  could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect  on Acquiror. 

  



  

  3.6 _Financial Statements_. Acquiror has  previously made available to
Target true and correct copies of  (i) the consolidated balance sheets of
Acquiror and its  Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and the 
related consolidated statements of income and changes in  shareholders
equity and cash flows for the fiscal years  ended December 31, 2004 through
2006, inclusive as reported  in Acquirors Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, filed with the  SEC under the
Exchange Act and accompanied by the audit report  of KPMG LLP, independent
registered public accountants with  respect to Acquiror, and (ii) the
unaudited consolidated  balance sheet of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries as
of  December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, and the related  consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders  equity and cash flows for the
three- and six-month periods ended  June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2007, as
reported in  Acquirors Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q  for the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2007 (the  "Acquiror  Form 10-Q").  The financial
statements referred to in this  _Section 3.6_ (including the related notes,
where  applicable) fairly present in all material respects the  consolidated
results of operations, changes in  shareholders equity, cash flows and
financial position of  Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for the respective
fiscal periods  or as of the respective dates therein set forth, subject to 
normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited  statements; each
of such statements (including the related  notes, where applicable) complies
in all material respects with  applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules  and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and
each of  such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) 
has been prepared in all material respects in accordance with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States  (" _GAAP_ ") consistently
applied during the  periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in
such  statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of  Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,  maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and  any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and  reflect only actual transactions. 

  



  

  3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Except for  Sandler, ONeill and Partners, L.P.,
neither  Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary nor any of their respective 
officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or  incurred any
liability for any brokers fees, commissions  or finders fees in connection
with the Merger or related  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. 

  



  

  (a) Since June 30, 2007, no event or events have  occurred that have had
or are reasonably likely to have, either  individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on  Acquiror. 

  



  

  (b) Since June 30, 2007, through and including the  date of this
Agreement, Acquiror and its Subsidiaries have  carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects  in the ordinary course. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  3.9 _Legal Proceedings_. 

  



  

  (a) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.9(a)_ of  the Acquiror Disclosure
Schedule, neither Acquiror nor any of  its Subsidiaries is a party to any,
and there are no pending or,  to the best of Acquirors knowledge,
threatened, legal,  administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions  or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature  against
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or challenging the  validity or propriety
of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement as to which, in any such
case, there is a reasonable  probability of an adverse determination and
which, if adversely  determined, will be reasonably likely to, either
individually or  in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. 

  



  

  (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or  regulatory
restriction (other than those that apply to similarly  situated bank holding
companies or banks) imposed upon Acquiror,  any of its Subsidiaries or the
assets of Acquiror or any of its  Subsidiaries that has had, or will have,
either individually or  in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. 

  



  

  3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. 

  



  

  (a) Each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has duly filed  all federal,
state, foreign and local information returns and  Tax returns required to be
filed by it on or prior to the date  of this Agreement (all such returns
being accurate and complete  in all material respects) and has duly paid or
made provision  for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are
due  or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local 
taxing authorities other than (i) Taxes or other  governmental charges that
are not yet delinquent or are being  contested in good faith or have not been
finally determined and  have been adequately reserved against under GAAP,
or  (ii) information returns, Tax returns or Taxes as to which  the failure
to file, pay or make provision for is not reasonably  likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. The
federal income Tax  returns of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries to the knowledge
of  Acquiror have not been examined by the IRS. There are no  material
disputes pending, or to the knowledge of Acquiror,  claims asserted, for
Taxes or assessments upon Acquiror or any  of its Subsidiaries for which
Acquiror does not have reserves  that are adequate under GAAP. Neither
Acquiror nor any of its  Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing,  allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other 
than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or  among Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries). Within the past five  years, neither Acquiror nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been a  "distributing corporation" or a "controlled 
corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under  Section 355(a) of
the Code. Acquiror has no liability for  Taxes of any person arising from the
application of Treasury  Regulation  section 1.1502-6  or any analogous
provision of state, local or foreign law, or as  a transferee or successor,
by contract, or otherwise. No closing  agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of
the Code (or any  similar provision of state, local or foreign law) has
been  entered into by or with respect to Acquiror. All Taxes required  to be
withheld, collected or deposited by or with respect to  Acquiror have been
timely withheld, collected or deposited as  the case may be, and to the
extent required, have been paid to  the relevant taxing authority, except for
failures to so  withhold, collect or deposit that are immaterial,
individually  and in the aggregate. Acquiror has not been requested to
grant,  or has granted, any waiver of any federal, state, local or  foreign
statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension  of a period for the
assessment of, any Tax, which waiver or  extension has not since expired.
Acquiror has not participated  in any "listed transaction" or "reportable 
transaction" or "tax shelter" within the meaning  of the Code requiring it to
file, register, prepare, produce or  maintain any disclosure, report, list or
any other statement or  document under Sections 6111 or 6112 of the Code.
Acquiror  is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably  be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a  reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the  Code. Except as set forth on _Section
3.10(a)_ of the  Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and
delivery  of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby will cause the imposition on Acquiror of any  excise tax
or penalty under Section 4999 of the Code or  result in payment of any non-
deductible "parachute  payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the 
Code. 

  



  

  (b) As used in this Agreement, the term  " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means 
(i) all federal, state, local, and foreign income, excise,  gross receipts,
gross income, ad valorem, profits, gains,  property, capital, sales,
transfer, use, payroll, employment,  severance, withholding, duties,
intangibles, franchise, backup  withholding, and other taxes, charges, levies
or like  assessments together with all penalties and additions to tax and 
interest thereon and (ii) any 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  liability for Taxes described in clause (i) under Treasury  Regulation
Section 1.1502-6  (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law). 

  



  

  3.11 _Employees_. 

  



  

  (a) _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Acquiror Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of each material  benefit or compensation plan,
arrangement or agreement, and any  material bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, vacation,  stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment,
change of  control or fringe benefit plan, program or agreement that is 
maintained, or contributed to, for the benefit of current or  former
directors or employees of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries  or with respect to
which Acquiror or its Subsidiaries may,  directly or indirectly, have any
liability to such directors or  employees, as of the date of this Agreement
(the  " _Acquiror Benefit Plans_ "). 

  



  

  (b) Acquiror has heretofore made available to Target true  and complete
copies of each of the Acquiror Benefit Plans and  certain related documents,
including, but not limited to,  (i) the actuarial report for such Acquiror
Benefit Plan (if  applicable) for each of the last two years, and (ii) the 
most recent determination letter or opinion letter (upon which  Acquiror is
permitted to rely) from the IRS (if applicable) for  such Acquiror Benefit
Plan. 

  



  

  (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,  either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect on Acquiror, (i)
each of the Acquiror Benefit Plans  has been operated and administered in all
material respects in  compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of  1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") and the Code,  (ii) each of the
Acquiror Benefit Plans intended to be  "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a)  of the Code and has received a favorable determination letter
or  opinion letter (upon which Acquiror is entitled to rely) from  the IRS
that such Acquiror Benefit Plan is so qualified, and to  the knowledge of
Acquiror, there are no existing circumstances  or any events that have
occurred that will adversely affect the  qualified status of any such
Acquiror Benefit Plan,  (iii) with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan
which is  subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued 
benefits under such Acquiror Benefit Plan, based upon the  actuarial
assumptions used for funding purposes in the most  recent actuarial report
prepared by such Acquiror Benefit  Plans actuary with respect to such
Acquiror Benefit Plan,  did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the
then  current value of the assets of such Acquiror Benefit Plan  allocable
to such accrued benefits, (iv) no Acquiror  Benefit Plan provides benefits,
including, without limitation,  death or medical benefits (whether or not
insured), with respect  to current or former employees or directors of
Acquiror or its  Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination
of  service, other than (A) coverage mandated by applicable  law, (B) death
benefits or retirement benefits under any  "employee pension plan" (as such
term is defined in  Section 3(2) of ERISA), (C) deferred compensation 
benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of Acquiror or its  Subsidiaries
or (D) benefits the full cost of which is  borne by the current or former
employee or director (or his  beneficiary), (v) no material liability under
Title IV  of ERISA has been incurred by Acquiror, its Subsidiaries or any 
trade or business, whether or not incorporated, all of which  together with
Acquiror, would be deemed a "single  employer" under Section 4001 of ERISA
(a  " _Acquiror ERISA Affiliate_ ") that has not been  satisfied in full,
and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no  condition exists that presents a
material risk to Acquiror, its  Subsidiaries or any Acquiror ERISA Affiliate
of incurring a  material liability thereunder, (vi) no Acquiror Benefit 
Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as such term  is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA), (vii) all  contributions due and payable by Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries as  of the Effective Time with respect to each Acquiror Benefit
Plan  in respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or  accrued
in accordance with GAAP, (viii) none of Acquiror,  its Subsidiaries or any
other person, including any fiduciary,  has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which Acquiror,  its Subsidiaries or any Acquiror Benefit
Plan will be subject to  either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant
to  Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax imposed  pursuant to
Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, and  (ix) to the knowledge of Acquiror
there are no pending,  threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine
claims for  benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Acquiror 
Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto. 

  



  

  (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement  nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby  will (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event)  (i) result (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any  additional acts or events) in any payment (including,
without  limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "excess 
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G  of the Code),
forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming  due to any current
director or employee of Acquiror or any of  its affiliates 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  from Acquiror or any of its affiliates under any Acquiror  Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits  otherwise payable under any Acquiror
Benefit Plan or (iii)  result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of  any such benefits that will, either individually or in the 
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. 

  



  

  (e) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified  deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of  Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
has been operated in good  faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code,
IRS Notice  2005-1,  Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the
Code,  and any subsequent guidance relating thereto, and no additional  tax
under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is  reasonably expected
to be incurred by a participant in any such  Acquiror Benefit Plan, and no
employee of the Acquiror or its  Subsidiaries is entitled to any  gross-up
or  otherwise entitled to indemnification by the Acquiror, any  Subsidiary
of the Acquiror or any Acquiror ERISA Affiliate for  any violation of Section
409A of the Code. 

  



  

  3.12 _SEC Reports_. Acquiror has previously  made available to Target an
accurate and complete copy of each  (a) final registration statement,
prospectus, report,  schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since 
January 1, 2002 by Acquiror with the SEC pursuant to the  Securities Act or
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
and prior to the  date hereof and (b) communication mailed by Acquiror to
its  shareholders since January 1, 2002. Acquiror has filed all  required
reports, schedules, registration statements and other  documents with the SEC
since January 1, 2002 (the  " _Acquiror Reports_ "). As of their respective 
dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a  filing prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such filing),  the Acquiror Reports
complied in all material respects with the  requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the  case may be, and the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder  applicable to such Acquiror Reports, and none of the
Acquiror  Reports when filed contained any untrue statement of a material 
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of  the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. 

  



  

  3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. 

  



  

  (a) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material  licenses,
franchises, permits, patents, trademarks and  authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their  respective businesses under and pursuant to
each, and have  complied in all material respects with and are not in default
in  any material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order,  rule,
regulation, policy, agreement  and/or  guideline of any Governmental Entity
relating to Acquiror or any  of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to
hold such  license, franchise, permit or authorization or such 
noncompliance or default will not, either individually or in the  aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. 

  



  

  (b) Except as will not have, either individually or in the  aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, Acquiror and  each of its Subsidiaries
have properly administered all accounts  for which it acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which  it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,
personal  representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in 
accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable  state and
federal law and regulation and common law. None of  Acquiror, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or  employee of Acquiror or of any of
its Subsidiaries, has  committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary  account that will have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, 
and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and  correct in
all material respects and accurately reflect the  assets of such fiduciary
account. 

  



  

  3.14 _Certain Contracts_. 

  



  

  (a) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.11(a)_ of  the Acquiror Disclosure
Schedule, neither Acquiror nor any of  its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any contract,  arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether
written or  oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any directors, 
officers or employees other than in the ordinary course of  business
consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon  the consummation or
shareholder approval of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or upon the  occurrence of any additional acts or events)
result in any  payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due 
from Acquiror, Target, the Surviving Corporation, or any of  their respective
Subsidiaries to any officer or employee  thereof, (iii) which is a "material
contract" (as  such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of  Regulation S-K 
of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement  that has not
been filed or incorporated by reference in the  Acquiror Reports, (iv)
which 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by  Acquiror or
upon consummation of the Merger will materially  restrict the ability of the
Surviving Corporation to engage in  any line of business in which a bank
holding company may  lawfully engage, (v) with or to a labor union or guild 
(including any collective bargaining agreement) or (vi)  (including any stock
option plan, stock appreciation rights  plan, restricted stock plan or stock
purchase plan) any of the  benefits of which will be increased, or the
vesting of the  benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of
any  shareholder approval or the consummation of any of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any  of the benefits of which
will be calculated on the basis of any  of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each  contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of
the type  described in this _Section 3.14(a)_, whether or not  set forth in
the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, is referred to  herein as a " _Acquiror
Contract_ ", and neither  Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or
has received  notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other 
parties thereto which will have, individually or in the  aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. 

  



  

  (b) (i) Each Acquiror Contract is valid and binding on  Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full  force and effect, (ii) Acquiror
and each of its  Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all 
obligations required to be performed by it to date under each  Acquiror
Contract, except where such noncompliance, either  individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a Material  Adverse Effect on Acquiror, and (iii) no
event or condition  exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of
time or  both, will constitute, a material default on the part of  Acquiror
or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Acquiror  Contract, except where
such default will not, either  individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect  on Acquiror. 

  



  

  3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory  Agencies._ Neither Acquiror nor any of
its  Subsidiaries is subject to any  cease-and-desist  or other order
issued by, or is a party to any written  agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding  with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar  undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or  has
been since January 1, 2002, a recipient of any  supervisory letter from, or
since January 1, 2002, has  adopted any board resolutions at the request of,
any Regulatory  Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts
in  any material respect the conduct of its business, would restrict  the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, or that in
any material manner relates to its capital  adequacy, its credit policies,
its management or its business  (each, whether or not set forth in the
Acquiror Disclosure  Schedule, a " _Acquiror Regulatory Agreement_ "),  nor
to the knowledge of Acquiror has Acquiror or any of its  Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2002, by any  Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is  considering issuing or requesting any such
Acquiror Regulatory  Agreement. 

  



  

  3.16 _Interest Rate Risk Management  Instruments._ Except as would not be
reasonably  likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a 
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, (a) all interest rate  swaps, caps,
floors and option agreements and other interest  rate risk management
arrangements, whether entered into for the  account of Acquiror or for the
account of a customer of Acquiror  or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered
into in the ordinary  course of business and, to Acquirors knowledge, in 
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules,  regulations
and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with  counterparties believed to
be financially responsible at the  time, and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Acquiror  or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance
with their  terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, 
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights  of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable  remedies), and are in full force
and effect; (b) Acquiror  and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in
all material  respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the 
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and  (c) to Acquirors
knowledge, there are no material  breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of  such by any party thereunder. 

  



  

  3.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities._ Except for  those liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved against  on the consolidated balance sheet of
Acquiror included in the  Acquiror  Form 10-Q  and for liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice since June
30, 2007, neither  Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability  of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent 
or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either  individually or
in the aggregate, has had or will have, a  Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  3.18 _Insurance._ Acquiror and its  Subsidiaries have in effect insurance
coverage with reputable  insurers or are self-insured, which in respect of
amounts,  premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably 
adequate coverage against all risks insured against by bank  holding
companies comparable in size and operations to Acquiror  and its
Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  3.19 _Environmental Liability._ There are  no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims,  actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations  or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any  nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably
result in the  imposition, on Acquiror of any liability or obligation
arising  under common law or under any local, state or federal 
environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including,  without
limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended  (" _CERCLA_ "), pending or, to the
knowledge of  Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror, which liability or 
obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a  Material
Adverse Effect on Acquiror. To the knowledge of  Acquiror, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding,  claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose  any liability or obligation that will,
individually or in the  aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. Acquiror  is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree,
letter  or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, 
regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or  obligation with
respect to the foregoing that will have, either  individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on  Acquiror. 

  



  

  3.20 _State Takeover Laws._ The Board of  Directors of Acquiror has
approved the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement for purposes of 
Sections 48-103-101  through  48-103-505  of the TBCA, if applicable to
Acquiror, such that the provisions  of such sections of the TBCA will not
apply to this Agreement or  any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. 

  



  

  3.21 _Reorganization._ As of the date of  this Agreement, Acquiror is not
aware of any fact or  circumstance that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the  Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within  the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  



  

  3.22 _Information Supplied._ None of the  information supplied or to be
supplied by Acquiror for inclusion  or incorporation by reference in (i)
the  Form S-4  will, at the time the  Form S-4  is filed with the SEC and
at the time it becomes effective under  the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material  fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not  misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the  date of
mailing to shareholders and at the times of the meetings  of shareholders to
be held in connection with the Merger,  contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state  any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in  order to make the statements therein, in light of
the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The  Joint
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material  respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules  and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, except that no  representation or warranty is made by Acquiror
with respect to  statements made or incorporated by reference therein based
on  information supplied by Target for inclusion or incorporation by 
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement. 

  



  

  3.23 _Internal Controls._ The records,  systems, controls, data and
information of Acquiror and its  Subsidiaries are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under  means (including any electronic, mechanical or
photographic  process, whether computerized or not) that are under the 
exclusive ownership and direct control of Acquiror or its  Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access  thereto and therefrom), except
for any non-exclusive ownership  and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to  have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of
internal  accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and 
to the extent described in the Acquiror Reports filed with the  SEC prior to
the date hereof, Acquiror and its Subsidiaries have  devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls  sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Acquiror  (i)
has designed disclosure controls and procedures to  ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror, including  its Subsidiaries, is made known
to the management of Acquiror by  others within those entities, and (ii) has
disclosed, based  on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,
to  Acquirors independent registered public accounting firm  and the audit
committee of Acquirors Board of Directors  (x) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in  the design or operation of internal control over
financial  reporting which are reasonably 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  likely to adversely affect Acquirors ability to record,  process,
summarize and report financial information and  (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves  management or other employees who have a significant
role in  Acquirors internal control over financial reporting.  Acquiror has
made available to Target a summary of any such  disclosure made by management
to Acquirors auditors and  audit committee since January 1, 2004. To the
knowledge of  Acquiror, it is in compliance in all material respects with 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

  



  

  3.24 _Opinion of Acquiror Financial  Advisor._ Acquiror has received the
opinion of its  financial advisor, Sandler, ONeill and Partners,  L.P., dated
the date of this Agreement, to the effect that the  Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to  Acquiror.

   REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET   

  



  

  Except as disclosed in (a) the Target Reports (defined  below) filed with
the SEC prior to the date hereof or  (b) the disclosure schedule (the "
_Target Disclosure  Schedule"_ ) delivered by Target to Acquiror prior to
the  execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among  other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or  appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure  requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception  to one or more representations or warranties
contained in this  _Article IV_ or to one or more of Targets  covenants
contained in _Article V_, provided, however,  that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the  contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set
forth in  such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if 
its absence would not result in the related representation or  warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard  established by _Section 9.2_,
and (ii) the mere  inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to
a  representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that  such
item represents a material exception or material fact,  event or circumstance
or that such item has had or would be  reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Target),  Target hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror
as follows:

power and authority to own  or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its  business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed
or  qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the  nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or  location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it  makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where  the failure to be so licensed or qualified would
not, either  individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect  on Target. 

  



  

  (b) Target is a bank holding company registered under the  BHC Act. True
and complete copies of the Charter (the  " _Target Charter_ "), and Bylaws of
Target, as in  effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously

to do business and in  good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,

conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and  in which the
failure to be so qualified would have a Material  Adverse Effect on Target,
and (iii) has all requisite  corporate or other power and authority to own or
lease its  properties and assets and to carry on its business as now 
conducted except to the extent that the failure to have such  power or
authority will not result in a Material Adverse Effect  on Target.

  (a) The authorized capital stock of Target consists of  Seventy Five
Million (75,000,000) shares of Target Common Stock,  of which, as of June 30,

to  register shares of Target Capital Stock or other securities  under the
Securities Act, except any such contractual  obligations entered into after
the date hereof as permitted by  _Section 5.2(b)._ 

  



  

  (d) Target owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued  and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity  ownership interests of
each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear  of any Liens, and all of such
shares or equity ownership  interests are duly authorized and validly issued

and the  availability of equitable remedies). 

  



  

  (b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.3(b)_ of  the Target Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and  delivery of this Agreement by Target,

charter or bylaws of any Target  Subsidiary, or (ii) assuming that the
consents and  approvals referred to in _Section 4.4_ are duly  obtained, (x)

respective properties or  assets of Target or any of its Subsidiaries under,
any of the  terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, 
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other  instrument or
obligation to which Target or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their  respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except  (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, 
conflicts, breaches or defaults which either individually or in  the
aggregate will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

reports, registrations and  statements, together with any amendments required
to be made  with respect thereto, that they were required to file since 
January 1, 2002 with the Regulatory Agencies, and all other  reports and
statements required to be filed by them since  January 1, 2002, including,

the laws, rules or  regulations of the United States, any state, or any
Regulatory  Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable 
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such  report,

Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the  knowledge of
Target, investigation into the business or  operations of Target or any of
its Subsidiaries since  January 1, 2002, except where such proceedings or 
investigation did not, or will not, either individually or in  the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Target. There  is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any  Regulatory Agency with respect to any report
or statement  (written or oral) relating to any examinations of Target or
any  of its Subsidiaries which, could reasonably be expected to,  either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse  Effect on
Target. 

  



  

  4.6 _Financial Statements._ Target has  previously made available to
Acquiror true and correct copies of  (i) the consolidated balance sheet of
Target and its  Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, and the

and cash flows for the fiscal years  ended December 31, 2004 through 2006,
inclusive as reported  in Targets Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the

where  applicable) fairly present in all material respects the  consolidated
results of operations, changes in  shareholders equity, cash flows and
financial position of  Target and its 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the  respective
dates therein set forth, subject to normal year-end  audit adjustments in the
case of unaudited statements; each of  such statements (including the related
notes, where applicable)  complies in all material respects with applicable
accounting  requirements and with the published rules and regulations of
the  SEC with respect thereto; and each of such statements (including  the
related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all  material respects
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied  during the periods involved,
except in each case as indicated in  such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records  of Target and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being,  maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and  any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and  reflect only actual
transactions. 

  



  

  4.7 _Broker s Fees._ Except for Hovde  Financial LLC, neither Target nor
any Target Subsidiary nor any  of their respective officers or directors has
employed any  broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. 

  



  

  (a) Since June 30, 2007, no event or events have  occurred that have had
or are reasonably likely to have, either  individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on  Target. 

  



  

  (b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.8(b)_ of  the Target Disclosure
Schedule, since June 30, 2007 through  and including the date of this
Agreement, Target and its  Subsidiaries have carried on their respective
businesses in all  material respects in the ordinary course. 

  



  

  4.9 _Legal Proceedings_. 

  



  

  (a) Except as disclosed in _Section 4.9(a)_ of  the Target Disclosure
Schedule, neither Target nor any of its  Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to  the best of Targets knowledge, threatened
legal,  administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions  or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature  against Target or
any of its Subsidiaries or challenging the  validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement as to which, in any such case,
there is a reasonable  probability of an adverse determination and which, if
adversely  determined, will be reasonably likely to, either individually or 
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Target. 

  



  

  (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or  regulatory
restriction (other than those that apply to similarly  situated bank holding
companies or banks) imposed upon Target,  any of its Subsidiaries or the
assets of Target or any of its  Subsidiaries that has had or will have,
either individually or  in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Target. 

  



  

  4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns._ Each of  Target and its Subsidiaries has
duly filed all federal, state,  foreign and local information returns and Tax
returns required  to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement
(all  such returns being accurate and complete in all material  respects)
and has duly paid or made provision for the payment of  all Taxes that have
been incurred or are due or claimed to be  due from it by federal, state,
foreign or local taxing  authorities other than (i) Taxes or other
governmental  charges that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in 
good faith or have not been finally determined and have been  adequately
reserved against under GAAP, or (ii) information  returns, Tax returns or
Taxes as to which the failure to file,  pay or make provision for is not
reasonably likely to have,  either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse  Effect on Target. The federal income Tax returns of Target
and  its Subsidiaries, to the knowledge of Target, have not been  examined
by the IRS. There are no material disputes pending, or  to the knowledge of
Target, claims asserted, for Taxes or  assessments upon Target or any of its
Subsidiaries for which  Target does not have reserves that are adequate under
GAAP.  Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is  bound
by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification  agreement or arrangement
(other than such an agreement or  arrangement exclusively between or among
Target and its  Subsidiaries). Within the past five years, neither Target
nor  any of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing  corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a  distribution intended to qualify under Section
355(a) of  the Code. Target has no liability for Taxes of any person 
arising from the application of Treasury Regulation  section 1.1502-6  or
any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law, or as  a transferee
or successor, by contract, or otherwise. No closing  agreement pursuant to
Section 7121 of the Code (or any  similar provision of state, local or
foreign law) has been  entered into by or with respect to Target. All Taxes
required to  be withheld, collected or deposited by or with respect to
Target  have been timely withheld, collected or deposited as the case  may
be, and to the extent required, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  have been paid to the relevant taxing authority, except for  failures to
so withhold, collect or deposit that are immaterial,  individually and in the
aggregate. Target has not been requested  to grant, or has granted, any
waiver of any federal, state,  local or foreign statute of limitations with
respect to, or any  extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax,
which  waiver or extension has not since expired. Target has not 
participated in any "listed transaction" or  "reportable transaction" or "tax
shelter"  within the meaning of the Code requiring it to file, register, 
prepare, produce or maintain any disclosure, report, list or any  other
statement or document under Sections 6111 or 6112 of  the Code. Target is not
aware of any fact or circumstance that  could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from  qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of  Section 368(a) of the Code. Except as set forth in  _Section 4.10_ of
the Target Disclosure Schedule,  neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
cause  the imposition of any excise tax or penalty under  Section 4999 of
the Code or result in payment of any  non-deductible "parachute payment"
within the meaning  of Section 280G of the Code. 

  



  

  4.11 _Employees_. 

  



  

  (a) _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Target Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of each material  benefit or compensation plan, arrangement
or agreement, and any  material bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
medical,  dental, life, vision, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, 
severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan,  program or
agreement that is maintained, or contributed to, for  the benefit of current
or former directors or employees of  Target and its Subsidiaries or with
respect to which Target or  its Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly,
have any liability  to such directors or employees, as of the date of this
Agreement  (the " _Target Benefit Plans_ "). 

  



  

  (b) Target has heretofore made available to Acquiror true  and complete
copies of each of the Target Benefit Plans and  certain related documents,
including, but not limited to,  (i) the actuarial report for such Target
Benefit Plan (if  applicable) for each of the last two years, and (ii) the 
most recent determination letter or opinion letter (upon which  Target is
permitted to rely) from the IRS (if applicable) for  such Target Benefit
Plan. 

  



  

  (c) Except as identified in _Section 4.11(a)_ of  the Target Disclosure
Schedule referenced above or as would not  reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Target, (i) each of  the Target Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in  all material respects in compliance with ERISA and the
Code,  (ii) each of the Target Benefit Plans intended to be  "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a)  of the Code and has received a
favorable determination letter or  opinion letter (upon which Target is
permitted to rely) from the  IRS that such Target Benefit Plan is so
qualified, and to the  knowledge of Target, there are no existing
circumstances or any  events that have occurred that will adversely affect
the  qualified status of any such Target Benefit Plan,  (iii) with respect
to each Target Benefit Plan which is  subject to Title IV of ERISA, the
present value of accrued  benefits under such Target Benefit Plan, based upon
the  actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most  recent
actuarial report prepared by such Target Benefit  Plans actuary with respect
to such Target Benefit Plan,  did not, as of its latest valuation date,
exceed the then  current value of the assets of such Target Benefit Plan

indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any  employee of
Target or any of its affiliates from Target or any  of its affiliates under

payable under any  Target Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration

documents with the SEC or the FDIC since January 1, 2002,  collectively (the
" _Target Reports_ "). As of  their respective dates of filing with the SEC
or the FDIC (or,  if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
hereof,  as of the date of such filing), the Target Reports complied in  all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities  Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and  regulations of the SEC
or FDIC thereunder applicable to such  Target Reports, and none of the Target
Reports when filed  contained any untrue statement of a material fact or

default  in any material respect under, any applicable law, statute,  order,
rule, regulation, policy, agreement  and/or  guideline of any Governmental
Entity relating to Target or any  of its Subsidiaries, except where the
failure to hold such  license, franchise, permit or authorization or such 
noncompliance or default will not, either individually or in the  aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Target. 

  



  

  (b) Except as will not have, either individually or in the  aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Target, Target and each  of its Subsidiaries have
properly administered all accounts for  which it acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which it  serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,
personal representative,  guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in
accordance with  the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and 
federal law and regulation and common law. None of Target, any  of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of  Target or of any of
its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach  of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account that will  have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, and
the accountings  for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in
all  material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such  fiduciary
account. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  4.14 _Certain Contracts_. 

  



  

  (a) Except as disclosed in _Section 4.14(a)_ of  the Target Disclosure

Surviving Corporation, or any of  their respective Subsidiaries to any
officer or employee  thereof, (iii) which is a "material contract" (as  such

this  _Section 4.14(a)_, whether or not set forth in the  Target Disclosure
Schedule, is referred to herein as a  " _Target Contract_ ", and neither
Target nor any  of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of,
any  violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which  will
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect on
Target.

Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full  force and effect, (ii) Target and
each of its Subsidiaries  has in all material respects performed all
obligations required  to be performed by it to date under each Target
Contract, except  where such noncompliance, either individually or in the 
aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Target,  and (iii) no
event or condition exists which constitutes  or, after notice or lapse of
time or both, will constitute, a  material default on the part of Target or
any of its  Subsidiaries under any such Target Contract, except where such 
default will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have  a Material
Adverse Effect on Target.

in  any material respect the conduct of its business, would restrict  the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or that in
any material manner relates to its capital  adequacy, its credit policies,
its management or its business  (each, whether or not set forth in the Target
Disclosure  Schedule, a " _Target Regulatory Agreement_ "),  nor, to the
knowledge of Target, has Target or any of its  Subsidiaries been advised

that it is  considering issuing or requesting any such Target Regulatory

entered  into in the ordinary course of business and, to Targets 
knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking practice and  applicable rules,
regulations and policies of any Regulatory  Authority and with counterparties
believed to be financially  responsible at the time, and are legal, valid and
binding  obligations of Target or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in 
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by  bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar  laws affecting the rights
of creditors generally and the  availability of equitable remedies), 

  
 #####

the Target Disclosure  Schedule, there are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other  proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private 
environmental investigations or remediation activities or  governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or  that could reasonably
result in the imposition, on Target of any  liability or obligation arising
under common law or under any  local, state or federal environmental statute,
regulation or  ordinance including, without limitation, CERCLA, pending or,
to  the knowledge of Target, threatened against Target, which  liability or
obligation will, either individually or in the  aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Target. To the  knowledge of Target, there is no reasonable
basis for any such  proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation
that  would impose any liability or obligation that will, either 
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect  on Target.
Target is not subject to any agreement, order,  judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any court,  governmental authority, regulatory agency

Agreement or  any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the  date of mailing

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The  Joint Proxy

accountants (including all means of access  thereto and therefrom), except
for any non-exclusive 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be  expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of  internal accounting controls
described in the following  sentence. As and to the extent described in the
Target Reports  filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Target and its 
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal  accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances  regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the  preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP.  Target (i) has designed disclosure
controls and procedures  to ensure that material information relating to
Target,  including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of 
Target by others within those entities, and (ii) has  disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date  hereof, to Targets independent
registered public  accounting firm and the audit committee of Targets
Board  of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material 
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over  financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely  affect Targets ability
to record, process, summarize and  report financial information and (y) any
fraud, whether or  not material, that involves management or other employees
who  have a significant role in Targets internal control over  financial
reporting.. Target has made available to Acquiror a  summary of any such
disclosure made by management to  Targets auditors and audit committee since
January 1,  2004. Target has initiated its process of compliance with 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and expects  to be in full
compliance therewith by the mandated compliance  date. 

  



  

  4.24 _Opinion of Target Financial  Advisor._ Target has received the

this  Agreement, to the effect that the consideration received by the 
holders of Target Common Stock is fair, from a financial point  of view, to
Target and the holders of Target Common Stock.

Agreement, except, in every case, as may  be required by applicable law;

the parties to obtain any necessary approvals of  any Regulatory Agency or
Governmental Entity required for the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

   ADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS   

  



  

  6.1 _Regulatory Matters._  

  



  

  (a) Target and Acquiror shall promptly prepare and file  with the SEC the
Joint Proxy Statement and Acquiror shall  promptly prepare and file with the
SEC the  Form S-4,  in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as
a  prospectus. Each of Target and Acquiror shall use their  reasonable best
efforts in consultation with their respective  legal counsel to have the 
Form S-4  declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as 
practicable after such filing, and Target and Acquiror shall  thereafter mail
or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their  respective shareholders.
Acquiror shall also use its reasonable  best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or  "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry
out  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Target  shall
furnish all information concerning Target and the holders  of Target Capital
Stock as may be reasonably requested in  connection with any such action. If
at any time prior to or  after the Effective Time any information relating to
either of  the parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or 
directors, should be discovered by either party which should be  set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any of the  Form S-4  or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that such documents  would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to  state any material fact necessary
to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were  made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information 
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent  required by
law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment  or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly  filed with the SEC and disseminated or
made available on the  SECs EDGAR database to the shareholders of Acquiror
and  Target. 

  



  

  (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and  use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file  all necessary
documentation to effect all applications, notices,  petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all  permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third  parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or  advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger), and to  comply with
the terms and conditions of all such permits,  consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental  Entities. Target and Acquiror shall
have the right to review in  advance, and, to the extent practicable, each
will consult the  other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating
to  the exchange of information, all the information relating to  Acquiror
or Target, as the case may be, and any of their  respective Subsidiaries,
which appear in any filing made with,  or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any  Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing  right, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as  promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will  consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all  permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third  parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and  each party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters  relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated herein. 

  



  

  (c) Each of Target and Acquiror shall, upon request,  furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its  Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such  other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in  connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the  Form S-4  or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or  on behalf of
Target, Acquiror or any of their respective  Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. 

  



  

  (d) Each of Target and Acquiror shall promptly advise the  other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental  Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of  the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such  party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any  Requisite Regulatory 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Approval (as defined below) will not be obtained, that the  receipt of any
such approval will be materially delayed or that  non-customary or burdensome
conditions or post-closing  requirements might be imposed on any such
Required Regulatory  Approval. 

  



  

  (e) Acquiror and Target shall promptly furnish each other  with copies of
written communications received by Acquiror and  Target, as the case may be,
or any of their respective  Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the
foregoing to, any  Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement. 

  



  

  6.2 _Access to Information._  

  



  

  (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws  relating to the
exchange of information, each of Target and  Acquiror, for the purposes of
verifying the representations and  warranties of the other and preparing for
the Merger and the  other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and
shall  cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the 
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other  representatives of the
other party, access, during normal  business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to  all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records  and, during such period, each of Target and Acquiror shall, and 
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to  the other
party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,  registration statement and other
document filed or received by  it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal  securities laws or federal or state banking laws
(other than  reports or documents which Target or Acquiror, as the case may 
be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and  (ii) all other
information concerning its business,  properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request.  Neither Target nor Acquiror nor any of their
respective  Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to 
disclose information where such access or disclosure would  violate or
prejudice the rights of Targets or  Acquirors, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the  attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or  control of such information or contravene any law, rule, 
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding  agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The  parties hereto will
make appropriate substitute disclosure  arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of  the preceding sentence apply. 

  



  

  (b) Each of Acquiror and Target agrees that it will not,  and will cause
its representatives not to, use any information  obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ (as well as  any other information obtained prior to the date
hereof in  connection with entering into this Agreement) for any purpose 
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this
Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each  party will keep
confidential, and will cause its representative  to keep confidential, all
information and documents obtained  pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ (as well
as any other  information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection
with  the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information  (i) was
already known to such party, (ii) becomes  available to such party from other
sources not known by such  party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation,
(iii) is  disclosed with the prior written approval of the providing party 
or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from publicly  available sources.
If this Agreement is terminated or the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall otherwise fail  to be consummated, each party shall promptly
cause all copies of  documents or extracts thereof containing information and
data as  to the other party to be returned to the other party or shall 
promptly destroy such items and certify to such other party the  destruction
thereof. 

  



  

  (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their  respective
representatives shall affect the representations and  warranties of the other
set forth herein. 

  



  

  6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals. _ Each  of Target and Acquiror shall call a
meeting of its shareholders  (a " _Target Shareholders  Meeting_" or  "
_Acquiror Shareholders  Meeting_", as the  case may be) to be held as soon
as reasonably practicable for  the purpose of voting upon proposals to adopt
and approve this  Agreement and the Merger, and each shall use its reasonable
best  efforts, to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably 
practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each  of Acquiror
and Target shall use its reasonable best efforts  (and subject to its
fiduciary duty) to obtain from the  shareholders of Acquiror and Target, as
the case may be, the  vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
required by the  TBCA and Acquirors and Targets Charter and Bylaws,  as
the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby (such
approval a " _Target Shareholder  Approval_ " or " _Acquiror Shareholder 
Approval_ ", as the case may be). Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
herein, unless this Agreement has been  terminated, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the  shareholders of Target and Acquiror at such meeting for
the  purpose of obtaining the Target Shareholder Approval or Acquiror 
Shareholder Approval, as 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  the case may be, and voting on the approval and adoption of this 
Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to  relieve Target and
Acquiror of such obligations. 

  



  

  6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger._ Each of  Target and Acquiror shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to,  use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to  be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable  to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be 
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the  Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to 
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, 
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any  Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required  to be obtained by Acquiror
or Target or any of their respective  Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  6.5 _Affiliates._ Target shall use its  reasonable best efforts to cause
each director, executive  officer and other person who is an "affiliate"
(for  purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Target to  deliver
to Acquiror, as soon as practicable after the date of  this Agreement, and
prior to the date of the shareholders  meetings called by Target to be held
pursuant to  _Section 6.3_, a written agreement, in the form of  _Exhibit
6.5._ 

  



  

  6.6 _Stock Quotation or Listing._ Acquiror  shall cause the shares of
Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in  the Merger to be qualified for
quotation or listing on the  NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official
notice of  issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  



  

  6.7 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements._  

  



  

  (a) Within one year following the Effective Time, to the  extent
permissible under the terms of the Acquiror Benefit  Plans, the employees of
Target and its Subsidiaries (the  " _Target Employees_ ") will be eligible
to  participate in Acquirors employee benefit plans in which  similarly
situated employees of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries  participate, to the same
extent as similarly situated employees  of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries (it
being understood that  inclusion of Target Employees in Acquirors employee 
benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to  different plans)
except as provided below. 

  



  

  (b) With respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is an  " _employee
benefit plan_ ," as defined in  section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes of
determining  eligibility to participate, and entitlement to benefits, 
including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, but  not for
purposes of benefit accrual, service with Target shall  be treated as service
with Acquiror; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service shall not be
recognized to the  extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
or  increase of benefits. Such service also shall to the extent  permissible
under the terms of the Acquiror Benefit Plans and as  permitted by the
applicable insurer, apply for purposes of  satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability  requirements, or the application of any preexisting
condition  limitations. Each Acquiror Benefit Plan shall to the extent 
permissible under the terms of the Acquiror Benefit Plans and as  permitted
by the applicable insurer, waive pre-existing  condition limitations to the
same extent waived under the  applicable Target Benefit Plan. Target
Employees shall be given  credit for amounts paid under a corresponding
benefit plan  during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, 
copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had  been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the  Acquiror Benefit Plans
and to the extent permissible by the  applicable insurer. 

  



  

  (c) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror or the  Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will assume and honor and  shall cause the
appropriate Subsidiaries of Acquiror to assume  and to honor in accordance
with their terms all employment,  severance, change of control and other
compensation agreements  and arrangements between Target or its Subsidiaries
and any  employee thereof, and all accrued and vested benefit  obligations,
existing prior to the execution of this Agreement  which are between Target
or any of its Subsidiaries and any  current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant  thereof. 

  



  

  (d) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror or the  Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will, and will cause any  applicable Subsidiary
thereof or Employee Benefit Plan, to  provide or pay when due to Targets
employees as of the  Effective Time all benefits and compensation pursuant to
Target  Benefit Plans, programs and arrangements in effect on the date 
hereof earned or accrued through, and to which such individuals  are entitled
as of the Effective Time (or such later time as  such Benefit Plans as in
effect at the Effective Time are  terminated or canceled by Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation)  subject to compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers  Insurance._ 

  



  

  (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,  suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or  administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim,  action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any  individual who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date  of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a  director or officer or employee of Target or any of its 
Subsidiaries, or who is or was serving at the request of Target  or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or  agent of another
person, including any entity specified in the  Target Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Indemnified  Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party 
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out  of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a  director, officer or employee
of Target or any of its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors
or  (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated  hereby,
whether in any case asserted or arising before or after  the Effective Time,
the parties hereto agree to cooperate and  use their best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto. It  is understood and agreed that after the
Effective Time, Acquiror  shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent  permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any 
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including  reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the  final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or  investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent  permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required
by  applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement  in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,  suit,
proceeding or investigation. 

  



  

  (b) Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause  the
individuals serving as officers and directors of Target, its  Subsidiaries or
any entity specified in the Target Disclosure  Schedule immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be covered  for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time (or  the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if
longer)  by the directors and officers liability insurance  policy
maintained by Target ( _provided_ that Acquiror may  substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and  amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not less  advantageous than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions  occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed
by  such officers and directors in their capacity as such. 

  



  

  (c) In the event Acquiror or any of its successors or  assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other  person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation  or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its 
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such  case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so  that the successors and
assigns of Acquiror assume the  obligations set forth in this _Section
6.8._ 

  



  

  (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall  survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the  benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party  and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  



  

  6.9 _Additional Agreements._ In case at  any time before or after the
Effective Time any further action  is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this  Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger
between a  Subsidiary of Acquiror, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of 
Target, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with  full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,  immunities and franchises of
any of the parties to the Merger,  the proper officers and directors of each
party to this  Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such  necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the  sole
expense of, Acquiror. As long as Acquiror has certified to  Target that all
conditions to Closing have been met as described  in this Agreement, if
Acquiror makes a request to Target to make  accounting adjustments prior to
the Effective Time, such changes  shall be made, but to the extent Target
might not have otherwise  made such adjustments except at the request of
Acquiror, such  changes shall not impact the calculation of income or
financial  returns for purposes of determining the bonuses of employees of 
Target or its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  6.10 _Advice of Changes._ Target and  Acquiror shall each promptly advise
the other party of any  change or event (i) having a Material Adverse Effect
on it  or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably  likely to
cause or constitute a material breach of any of its  representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained  herein; provided, however,
that no such notification shall  affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements  of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the  conditions to the obligations of the parties under this  Agreement;
provided further that a failure to comply with this  _Section 6.10_ shall not
constitute the failure of any  condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied  unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach 
would independently result in the failure of a condition set  forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  6.11 _Exemption from Liability Under  Section 16(b)._ Acquiror and Target
agree  that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Target 
Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both  prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that  Target Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under  Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent  permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of  shares of Target Common Stock and Target Stock Options into 
shares of Acquiror Common Stock in the Merger, and for that  compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of  this _Section 6.11._ Assuming
that Target delivers to  Acquiror the Section 16 Information (as defined
below) in a  timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Acquiror, or a 
committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is  defined for
purposes of  Rule 16b-3(d)  under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution providing that  the receipt by Target Insiders of Acquiror Common
Stock in  exchange for shares of Target Common Stock, and of options on 
Acquiror Common Stock upon assumption of options to purchase  Target Common
Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement and to the extent such securities  are listed in the Section 16
Information, are intended to  be exempt from liability pursuant to Section
16(b) under  the Exchange Act. The term "Section 16  Information" shall mean
information accurate in all  material respects regarding Target Insiders, the
number of  shares of Target Common Stock held by each such Target Insider 
and expected to be exchanged for Acquiror Common Stock in the  Merger, and
the number and description of the options on Target  Common Stock held by
each such Target Insider and expected to be  assumed by Acquiror in
connection with the Merger; provided that  the requirement for a description
of any Target Stock Options  shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all
Target Stock  Plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, 
under which such Target Stock Options have been granted, have  been made
available to Acquiror. The term " _Target  Insiders_ " shall mean those
officers and directors of  Target who are subject to the reporting
requirements of  Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in
the  Section 16 Information. 

  



  

  6.12 _Acquisition Proposals._  

  



  

  (a) Target and its Subsidiaries and each of their  respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents  and representatives (including any
investment banker, financial  advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained  by Target or any of its Subsidiaries) shall
immediately cease  any discussions or negotiations with any other parties
that may  be ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of 
any Acquisition Proposal, as defined below. From the date of  this Agreement
through the Effective Time, Target shall not, nor  shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it  authorize or permit any of its or its
Subsidiaries  directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, 
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative  retained by
it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or  indirectly through another
person, (i) solicit, initiate or  encourage (including by way of furnishing
information or  assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate
or  encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal that  constitutes,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition  Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or  negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or  (iii) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or 
solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal. Any  violation of the
foregoing restrictions by any representative of  Target, whether or not such
representative is so authorized and  whether or not such representative is
purporting to act on  behalf of such party or otherwise, shall be deemed to
be a  breach of this Agreement by Target. 

  



  

  (b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of  Directors of Target
shall be permitted, prior to its meeting of  shareholders to be held pursuant
to _Section 6.3_, to  engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide
any  nonpublic information or data to, any person in response to an 
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such  person made after
the date of this Agreement which its Board of  Directors concludes in good
faith constitutes or is reasonably  likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
as defined below, if  and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of
Target  reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with 
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to  violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and subject to  compliance with the
other terms of this _Section 6.12_  and to first entering into a
confidentiality agreement having  customary non-disclosure, confidentiality,
standstill and  non-solicitation and no hire provisions that are reasonably 
satisfactory to Acquiror. 

  



  

  (ii) Target shall notify Acquiror promptly (but in no event  later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition  Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to  Target or any of its Subsidiaries by any
person that informs  Target or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering
making,  or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any 
person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such  party relating
to a possible 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and  confirmed in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the  person making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and  the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, proposals or  offers (including a copy thereof
if in writing and any related  documentation or correspondence). Target shall
also promptly,  and in any event within 24 hours, notify Acquiror, orally 
and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations  concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic  information or data to any person
in accordance with this  _Section 6.12(b)_ and keep Acquiror informed of
the  status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or 
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy  of all
material documentation or correspondence relating thereto. 

  



  

  (iii) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.14_  shall prohibit Target or
its Subsidiaries from taking and  disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by  Rule 14e-2(a)  or  Rule 14d-9  promulgated under the Exchange
Act; provided, however, that  compliance with such rules shall not in any way
limit or modify  the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules
has  under any other provision of this Agreement. 

  



  

  (c) Target agrees that (i) it will and will cause its  Subsidiaries, and
its and their officers, directors, agents,  representatives and advisors to,
cease immediately and terminate  any and all existing activities, discussions
or negotiations  with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to
any  Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any  third party
from, or waive any provisions of, any  confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it or any of  its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to
any Acquisition  Proposal. 

  



  

  (d) Nothing in this _Section 6.12_ shall  (x) permit Target to terminate
this Agreement or  (y) affect any other obligation of Target under this 
Agreement. Target shall not submit to the vote of its  shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. 

  



  

  (e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term  "Acquisition Proposal" means
any inquiry, proposal or  offer, filing of any regulatory application or
notice (whether  in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do
any  of the foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct  or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that  constitutes a
substantial portion of the net revenues, net  income or assets of Target or
any of its significant  subsidiaries (as defined under  Regulation S-X  of
the SEC), (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase  of any class of
equity securities representing 10% or more of  the voting power of Target or
its significant subsidiaries,  (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated  would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of 
the voting power of Target, or (z) merger, consolidation,  business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution  or similar
transaction involving Target or any of its  Subsidiaries, in each case other
than the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  (f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior  Proposal" means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal  which the Board of Directors of Target
concludes in good faith,  after consultation with its financial advisors and
legal  advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory  and
other aspects of the proposal and the person making the  proposal (including
any  break-up  fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to 
consummation), (i) is more favorable to the shareholders of  Target from a
financial point of view, than the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) is fully financed  or reasonably capable of being fully
financed, reasonably likely  to receive all required governmental approvals
on a timely basis  and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the
terms  proposed; provided that, for purposes of this definition of 
"Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal  shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in  _Section 6.12(e)_ except that the reference to 
"10% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition  Proposal" shall be deemed to
be a reference to "a  majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only  be
deemed to refer to a transaction involving Target. 

  



  

  6.13 _Bank Merger_. At or prior to the  Effective Time, if requested by
Acquiror, Target shall cause  PrimeTrust Bank and Bank of the South, or one
of such banks, to  enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Bank 
Merger Agreement") with Pinnacle National Bank pursuant to  which PrimeTrust
Bank and Bank of the South, or one of such  banks, shall merge with and into
Pinnacle National Bank after  the Merger. Promptly following execution of
such Bank Merger  Agreement, Target shall approve such agreement as the
sole  shareholder of PrimeTrust Bank or Bank of the South, as the case  may
be. The Bank Merger Agreement shall contain such terms and  conditions as are
reasonable, normal and customary in light of  the transactions contemplated
hereby including a covenant that  consummation of the merger of PrimeTrust
Bank or Bank of the  South, as the case may be, with and 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  into Pinnacle National Bank would not occur earlier than  simultaneous
with consummation of the Merger and a provision for  termination of the Bank
Merger Agreement upon termination of  this Agreement.

the Effective Time, whether  before or after approval of the Merger by the
shareholders of  Target or Acquiror: 

  



  

  (a) by mutual consent of Acquiror and Target in a written  instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a  vote of a majority of the
members of its respective entire Board  of Directors; 

  



  

  (b) by either Acquiror or Target, upon written notice to  the other party,
if a Governmental Entity that must provide  Acquiror or Target with a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has  denied approval of the Merger and such
denial has become final  and non-appealable; or any Governmental Entity of
competent  jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or 
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or  otherwise
prohibiting the Merger, and such order, decree, ruling  or other action has
become final and non-appealable; provided,  however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available
to any party  whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement
has  been the cause of, or resulted in, such action; 

  



  

  (c) by either Acquiror or Target, upon written notice to  the other party,
if the Merger shall not have been consummated  on or before March 31, 2008;
provided, however, that the  right to terminate this Agreement under this 
_Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party  whose failure to comply
with any provision of this Agreement has  been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Effective  Time to occur on or before such date; 

  



  

  (d) by either Target or Acquiror (provided that the party  terminating
shall not be in material breach of any of its  obligations under _Section
6.3_) if any approval of  the shareholders of Target or Acquiror required for
the  consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained upon a  vote
taken thereon at a duly held meeting of such shareholders  or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof; 

  



  

  (e) by either Acquiror or Target (provided that the  terminating party is
not then in material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained  herein) if there shall have been a breach of 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  any of the representations or warranties set forth in this  Agreement by
the other party, which breach is not cured within  thirty days following
written notice to the party committing  such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured  prior to the Closing; provided, however, that
neither party  shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
this _Section 8.1(e)_ unless the breach of  representation or warranty,
together with all other such  breaches, would entitle the party receiving
such representation  not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
under  _Section 7.2(a)_ (in the case of a breach of a  representation or
warranty by Acquiror) or  _Section 7.3(a)_ (in the case of a breach of a 
representation or warranty by Target ); 

  



  

  (f) by either Acquiror or Target (provided that the  terminating party is
not then in material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained  herein) if there shall have been a breach of any
of the  covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part  of
the other party, which breach shall not have been cured  within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of  written notice of such breach
from the other party hereto, or  which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the  Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the 
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(f)_ unless
the breach of covenant,  together with all other such breaches, would entitle
the party  entitled to the benefit of such covenant not to consummate the 
transactions contemplated hereby under  _Section 7.2(b)_ (in the case of a
breach of covenant  by Acquiror) or _Section 7.3(b)_ (in the case of a 
breach of covenant by Target );

other does not publicly recommend in the Joint  Proxy Statement that its
shareholders approve and adopt this  Agreement, (ii) after recommending in
the Joint Proxy  Statement that such shareholders approve and adopt this 
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the other shall have  withdrawn,
modified or amended such recommendation in any manner  adverse to the other
party, or (iii) the other party  materially breaches its obligations under
this Agreement by  reason of a failure to call a meeting of its shareholders
or a  failure to prepare and mail to its shareholders the Joint Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus in accordance with _Sections 6.1_  and _6.3_ ; 

  



  

  (h) by Acquiror, if the Board of Directors of Target has  authorized,
recommended, proposed or publicly announced its  intention to authorize,
recommend or propose any Acquisition  Proposal with any person other than
Acquiror; or 

  



  

  (i) by Target upon the occurrence of both of the following  events: (i)

(a) the number obtained by  dividing the Average Closing Price by the average
of the per  share closing price of Acquiror Common Stock on the NASDAQ 
Global Select Market for the ten (10) consecutive trading  days ending on

"Acquiror Ratio") is less than  (b) the number obtained by dividing the Index
Value (as  defined below) on the Determination Date by the Index Value on 
the Starting Date rounded to four decimal places minus .25 (the  "Index
Ratio").

prices of shares of Acquiror Common Stock  as reported on The NASDAQ Global
Select Market for the ten  (10) consecutive full trading days ending on

  8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event  of termination of this
Agreement by either Target or Acquiror as  provided in _Section 8.1_, this
Agreement shall  forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or 
obligation on the part of Acquiror or Target or their respective  officers or
directors, except (A) with respect to  _Sections 6.2(b)_, _8.2_ , _8.3_ ,
_9.4_ ,  _and_ _9.10_ , which shall survive such termination  (B) with
respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or  suffered by a party as a
result of the willful and material  breach by the other party of any of its
representations,  warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in
this  Agreement. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  8.3 _Termination Fee._  

  



  

  (a) Target shall pay Acquiror, by wire transfer of  immediately available
funds, the sum of $8.0 million (the  "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is
terminated as  follows: 

  



  

  (i) if Acquiror shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.1(g)_ (as a result of Targets failure  to comply with the provisions of
_Section 8.1(g)_) or  _8.1(h)_ , then Target shall pay the Termination Fee on
the  business day following such termination; 

  



  

  (ii) if (A) either party shall terminate this  Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_ because the  required Target Shareholder Approval shall not
have been  received and (B) at any time after the date of this  Agreement
and at or before the Target Shareholders Meeting a  bona fide Acquisition
Transaction, as defined below, shall have  been publicly announced or
otherwise communicated to the Board  of Directors of Target (a "Public
Proposal") that has  not been withdrawn prior to such date and within six 
(6) months of the date of such termination of this  Agreement, Target or any
of its Subsidiaries enters into a  definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any  Acquisition Transaction, then Target shall pay the
Termination  Fee on the date of such execution or consummation; and 

  



  

  (iii) if (A) either party shall terminate this  Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ or Acquiror  shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(e)_ or _(f)_ , (B) at any time  after the date of this Agreement
and before such termination  there shall have been a Public Proposal with
respect to Target  that has not been withdrawn prior to such termination,
and  (C) following the occurrence of such Public Proposal,  Target shall
have intentionally breached (and not cured after  notice thereof) any of its
representations, warranties,  covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which  breach shall have materially contributed to the failure of
the  Effective Time to occur prior to the termination of this  Agreement and
within six (6) months of the date of such  termination of this Agreement,
Target or any of its Subsidiaries  enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or  consummates, any Acquisition Transaction, then Target shall

legal fees and  expenses) incurred by Acquiror in connection with any action
or  proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to  collect
such unpaid amounts, together with interest on such  unpaid amounts at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such  time, as published in the Wall Street
Journal, from the date  such amounts were required to be paid until the date
actually  received by the other party. 

  



  

  (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained  in _Section
8.2_ and _8.3_ are an integral part  of the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement.

shall mean (i) the  direct or indirect acquisition, purchase or assumption of
all or  a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Target,  (ii) the
acquisition by any person of direct or indirect  beneficial ownership

similar transaction of or involving Target, other than a merger,  business
combination or similar transaction pursuant to which  persons who are
shareholders of Target immediately prior to such  transaction own 60% or more
of the voting stock of the surviving  entity (or parent thereof) immediately
after consummation of  such transaction. 

  



  

  8.4 _Amendment._ Subject to compliance with  applicable law and _Section
1.1(b)_, this Agreement  may be amended by the parties hereto, by action
taken or  authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time

any extension or waiver  of this Agreement or any portion thereof which
reduces the  amount or changes the form of the consideration to be
delivered  to the holders of Target Common Stock hereunder, other than as 
contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a  party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only  if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such  party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on  strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or  condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with  respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
