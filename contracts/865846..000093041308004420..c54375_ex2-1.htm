to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration and the amount of dividends with a record date prior to the date of the Effective Time to which the holder of shares represented by such Certificate is entitled. No interest will be
