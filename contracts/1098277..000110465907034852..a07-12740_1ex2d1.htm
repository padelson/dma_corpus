conditions by the Long-stop Date.

  

 **4.2 ** The Parties agree that the Circular shall only be posted by Offeree

Condition Date.

  

 **4.3 ** The Parties agree that the Scheme shall be conditional upon the
satisfaction (or waiver where this is permitted by the terms thereof) of:

 **4.5 ** Each of the Parties shall (and shall procure that its subsidiaries
and their respective directors and employees shall) use all reasonable
endeavours to procure the satisfaction of the Pre-Conditions and Conditions
and the implementation of the Transaction as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of the Announcement, and shall use all reasonable
endeavours to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any governmental antitrust
authority or any other Person so as to enable the Parties hereto to close the
Transaction contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and, in any
event, no later than the Long-stop Date, including the defense of any
governmental litigation or regulatory proceedings that would have the effect
of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Transaction by
no later than the Long-stop Date and/or commencement and pursuit of
litigation seeking to prevent the entry of, or seeking to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, or seeking to avoid a reference of the Transaction by
the OFT to the UK Competition Commission ( _provided however,_ the Parties
shall defend the proceedings before the OFT in order to avoid a reference to
the UK Competition Commission but shall not be obliged to commence litigation
against the OFT challenging its decision to refer the Transaction) or, in the
event of such reference to the UK Competition Commission being made, to avoid
the UK Competition Commission prohibiting the Transaction outright, which
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transaction by no later than the Long-stop Date.
The Parties shall not be obliged to defend any governmental litigation
or regulatory proceedings and/or commence and pursue any litigation
contemplated under this _Clause 4.5_ after (i) the Pre-Condition Date, or
(ii) if later, where a Pre-Condition has been reintroduced as a Condition and
the Takeover Offer is in fact made or the Scheme Circular is posted, the time
the Transaction lapses or is withdrawn. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
and all obligations of Offeror are without prejudice to the Offerors right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse to give or agree
to undertakings, assurances, amendments, divestitures or conditions (or
similar) regardless of whether any such undertaking, assurances,
amendments, divestitures or conditions may be likely to permit the
Transaction to be implemented, or implemented earlier than would otherwise be
the case, and to implement the Transaction substantially in the form
contemplated by the Announcement; _provided, however_ , that Offeror agrees
that it would not refuse to divest or license a product line of Offeree only
that has generated revenue of United States dollars of $2,000,000 or
less during the last fiscal year of Offeree and is not reasonably expected
to generate $2,000,000 or more in annual revenue during Offerees current
fiscal year or in subsequent fiscal years.

        



  

 **4.6** Without limiting the generality of Clause 4.5 above, but similarly
subject to the same restriction that any and all obligations are without
prejudice to the Offerors right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to
refuse to give or agree to undertakings, assurances, amendments, divestitures
or conditions (or similar) regardless of whether any such undertaking,
assurances, amendments, divestitures or conditions may be likely to permit
the Transaction to be implemented, or implemented earlier than would
otherwise be the case, and to implement the Transaction substantially in the
form contemplated by the Announcement, the Offeror shall use all reasonable
endeavours to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
court by any non-governmental individual or entity in order to avoid entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Transaction from
becoming effective (or becoming or being declared unconditional in all
respects) as promptly as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
in violation of any Regulatory Law, or if any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make
the Transaction illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or
delay the consummation of the Transaction (excluding the operation of
Section 78(2) Enterprise Act 2002), each Party shall cooperate with each
other and use all reasonable endeavours to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transaction and to have such statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed,
rescinded or made inapplicable. The Parties shall not be obliged to defend
any litigation, action or proceeding contemplated under this Clause 4.6 after
(i) the Long-stop Date or, if earlier, (ii) the time the Transaction lapses
or is withdrawn.

  

 **4.7 ** Offeree hereby acknowledges that Offeror and BidCo consider the
satisfaction of the Pre-Conditions and Conditions to be of material
significance to Offeror and BidCo in the context of the Transaction. Against
this background, each Party undertakes (except where otherwise prohibited by
a Legal Requirement from so doing) to keep the other Parties reasonably
informed on a timely basis as to progress towards, and all material
developments in relation to, satisfaction of the Pre-Conditions and
Conditions. To this end and subject to any Legal Requirement to the contrary:

  

 **(a) ** each Party undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to file, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any
Governmental Entity (including any foreign antitrust authority or court) with
respect to the Scheme or, as the case may be, the Takeover Offer and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly
any additional information requested by any such Governmental Entity
(including any foreign antitrust authority or court). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties shall prepare and file the
notifications required under the HSR Act within five Business Days after the
date of this Agreement and shall promptly prepare and file any necessary
filings under applicable foreign antitrust laws or regulations required to be
filed by such Party in connection with the Scheme or, as the case may be, the
Takeover Offer;

be, the Takeover Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for the purposes of initiating a review by the OFT of the
Transaction under Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002;

  

 **(c) **Offeror and/or BidCo undertake to respond as promptly as
 reasonably practicable to (i) any inquiries or requests received from the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department
of Justice, the OFT, the UK Competition Commission or any other
Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation including,
without limitation, a second request from the United States Federal Trade
Commission and/or the United States Department of Justice, and (ii) any
inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, court,
foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Entity in connection with
antitrust, competition or related matters;

unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to appointing counsel for
the purposes of the Scheme (including the Court Hearing(s));

  

 **(b) ** each of the directors of the Board of Offeree shall recommend that
the Offeree Shareholders vote in favor of the Scheme, except that a director
may withdraw, adversely modify or amend such recommendation if prior to the
completion of the Transaction, the Board of Offeree determines in good faith,
after consultation with, and based upon the advice of, its outside
legal advisers, at a meeting of the Board of Offeree, that the failure to
withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation would be reasonably likely to
be in breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Board of Offeree
or their duties under the Code;

  

 **(c) ** except as required by a Legal Requirement and subject to
_Clause 5.1(b)_ , the Offeree shall not seek to amend the Scheme or

Courts permission to convene the Court Meeting and file such documents as

 **(iii) **upon:

  

 **(1) **the necessary documents being settled with the Court; and

  

 **(2) **the Court making the order necessary for the purpose of convening
the Court Meeting,

  

Offeree shall promptly, in accordance with an order being made by the Court
in accordance with _Clause 5.1(e)(iii)(2)_ above and, in any event within
four days from such Court order, publish the requisite documents, including
the Circular, and thereafter in a timely manner publish and/or post such
other documents and information as the Court or any other Governmental Entity
may approve or require from time to time in connection with the proper
implementation of the Scheme according to the Timetable, provided that
Offeror provides Offeree with reasonable assistance;

  

 **(iv) **Offeree will convene the Extraordinary General Meeting to be held
immediately following the Court Meeting to consider and, if thought fit,

the Long-stop Date) provided that such adjournment is reasonably considered
necessary to implement the Scheme;

  

 **(vi) **following the Court Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting,
and assuming the Resolutions to be proposed at such meetings have been passed
by the requisite majorities, Offeree shall, as contemplated by the Timetable
but in consultation with BidCo, seek the sanction of the Court to the Scheme
and the reduction of capital and take all other action necessary to make the
Scheme effective;

        



  

 **(vii) **if the Court so requires or indicates, or if it is necessary to
implement the Scheme, Offeree shall reconvene the Court Meeting and any other
necessary shareholder meeting;

  

 **(viii) **as soon as practicable after the sanction of the Court of the
Scheme and the associated reduction of capital at the Court Hearing(s), and
in any event within one Business Day, Offeree shall cause an office copy of
the relevant Court Order(s) to be filed with the Registrar and registered by
him;

  

 **(ix) **Offeree will not, except to the extent required to do so on the
exercise of options under the Employee Share Option Scheme, granted or made
before the date of this Agreement, allot or issue any of its shares between

petition to confirm the reduction of capital provided for by the Scheme under
Section 137 of the Act and the time at which the Scheme becomes effective;

  

 **(x) **Offeree shall apply to the London Stock Exchange for its shares to

recommendation of the directors of the Board of Offeree to Offeree
Shareholders to vote in favor of the Scheme and the Extraordinary General
Meeting subject to _Clause 5.1(b)_.

  

 **(f) ** Offeror and BidCo will each procure that its directors (or such
other Persons connected with them as the Panel so require)
accept responsibility for all of the information in the Circular relating to
Offeror and BidCo, its Group and its Personnel to the extent required under
applicable Legal Requirements or the Code;

  

 **(g) ** Offeree will procure that the directors of Offeree
accept responsibility for all of the information in the Circular other
than information for which responsibility is accepted by Offeror and BidCo
under _Clause 5.1(f)_ above to the extent required under applicable Legal
Requirements or the Code;

  

 **(h) ** Offeree will submit drafts of the Circular to Offeror and BidCo for
review and comment reasonably in advance of the deadline for dispatching the
Circular and shall discuss such comments with Offeror and BidCo for the
purposes of preparing revised drafts.  Offeree agrees that the Circular, the
Scheme and the Resolutions shall be in a form consistent with the
Announcement and otherwise in a form reasonably satisfactory to BidCo
(subject to any Legal Requirements). Each Party undertakes to provide for
the purposes of inclusion in the Circular, all such information about itself,
its Group and their respective Personnel as may be required under the Code or
under any other Legal Requirement for inclusion in the Circular. Offeree
agrees to coordinate the preparation and dispatch of the Circular with
Offeror and BidCo and only to dispatch the Circular once the Circular is in a
form which is reasonably satisfactory to Offeror, BidCo and Offeree;

  

 **(i) ** upon the implementation of the Scheme, Offeror will pay
the Consideration at the Effective Time; and

        



  

 **(j) ** subject to any Legal Requirement, Offeree shall provide
all reasonable assistance requested by Offeror and BidCo, in order to (i)
determine the extent to which (if any) the provision of information to,
and/or consultation with, employees or their representatives is required in
connection with the Transaction; (ii) assist with the provision of such
information and/or consultation with employees or their representatives;
and/or (iii) assist with any proposals, communications and/or or integration
planning in relation to, or associated with, the Transaction, _provided
that,_ all information, communications with, or announcements to employees
and/or their representatives pursuant to this paragraph (j) shall first be
submitted to Offeror for Offerors review and approval.  This obligation
shall include, without limitation, the timely confirmation to Offeror and
BidCo of whether any local or national level collective agreements with trade
unions, works councils or any other employee representative bodies exist, and
the provision to Offeror of copies of any such agreements to the extent that
they may impact on Offerees obligations to inform and/or consult with
employees and/or their representatives. Offeree shall, if appropriate,
following release of the Announcement (or earlier if required by any
applicable laws or agreements), arrange and facilitate or continue
discussions with its employees and/or their representatives to enable Offeree
to fully comply with its obligations in this regard.

  

 **5.2 ** **Takeover Offer**

  

 **(a) ** Provided the Transaction has not, prior to such time, lapsed or
been withdrawn by Offeror and provided the Pre-Conditions or Conditions
to the Transaction have not already become incapable of satisfaction (other
than pursuant to a waiver of the same by Offeror), Offeror may elect at any
time to implement the Transaction by way of a Takeover Offer, whether or not
the Circular has been dispatched, provided that Offeror will consult with
Offeree before making that election and provided further that the Takeover
Offer is made on terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to
Offeree and its shareholders as the terms and conditions of the Scheme and
with an acceptance condition of ninety percent (90%) (or such lesser number
as Offeror may decide) of the shares to which the Takeover Offer relates.

  

 **(b) ** If Offeror elects to implement the Transaction by way of a Takeover
Offer in accordance with _Clause 5.2(a)_  all the directors of Offeree shall
recommend the Takeover Offer, except that a director may withdraw, adversely
modify or amend such recommendation if, prior to the completion of the
Transaction, the Board of Offeree determines in good faith at a meeting of
the Board of Offeree, after consultation with, and based upon the advice of,
its outside legal advisers, that the failure to withdraw, modify or amend
such recommendation would be reasonably likely to be in breach of the
fiduciary duties of the directors of the Board of Offeree or their duties
under the Code.

  

 **(c) ** If the Takeover Offer is recommended by a majority of the
directors of Offerees Board, Offeree shall (i) promptly provide all such
information about Offeree, its Group and its Personnel as may be reasonably
required for inclusion in the Offer Document and in all events within
ten Business Days; (ii) procure that its directors accept responsibility for
the information in the Offer Document relating to Offeree, its Group and
its Personnel to the extent required by a Legal Requirement; and (iii)

 **(a) ** neither Offeree, nor any Connected Person is currently negotiating,
or continuing any discussions or proposing to negotiate or enter
into discussions in relation to any Third Party Proposal;

  

 **(b) ** to the extent that Offeree, or any Connected Persons, have been
negotiating or continuing discussions with any person other than Offeror or
BidCo (or any person acting in concert with Offeror or BidCo in
accordance with the Code) in relation to a Third Party Proposal, those
negotiations or discussions have been terminated and Offeree has no reason to
believe that any such negotiations or discussions will recommence; and

  

 **(c) ** since December 7, 2006, being the date on which it was announced
that a preliminary approach had been made to Offeree, neither Offeree nor any
Connected Person has provided information in respect of, or relating to, the
Transaction or any Third Party Proposal to any person other than Offeror or
BidCo (or any person acting in concert with Offeror or BidCo in accordance
with the Code).

  

 **9.2 ** Subject to the release of the Announcement in accordance with 
_Clause 2.1_ and subject to the Transaction not already having lapsed or been
withdrawn or the Pre-Conditions or Conditions to the Transaction not being
incapable of being satisfied (unless waived) in accordance with such
Announcement, and without prejudice to any obligation to provide information
under Rule 20.2 of the Code, Offeree hereby undertakes to Offeror and BidCo
that:

  

 **(a) **in the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time
(or, if a Takeover Offer is made, the date on which the Takeover Offer
becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects) (the **"** **
_Exclusivity Period_ "**) it shall not, and it shall procure that no
Connected Person shall solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or knowingly
facilitate the communication, making, submission or announcement of any Third
Party Proposal.  Offeree hereby undertakes to Offeror and BidCo that during
the Exclusivity Period, it shall not negotiate with any person with respect
to a potential Third Party Proposal unless the Board determines, in good
faith, after consultation with, and upon the advice of external legal
advisers, that the failure to negotiate with such third party would be in
breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Board of Offeree or
their duties under the Code and Offeree shall promptly inform Offeror that it
is engaging in such negotiations; and

  

 **(b) **that, during the Exclusivity Period it shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than 24 hours after Offeree or any
Connected Party becomes aware of any such proposal or request for
information), notify Offeror and BidCo that it or any Connected Person has
received or has become aware of any unsolicited Third Party Proposal or
request for information under Rule 20.2 of the Code, and will disclose
to Offeror and BidCo any price or price range or the total amount of
consideration specified in such Third Party Proposal, or the commencement of
any negotiations with respect to an unsolicited Third Party Proposal. Offeree
shall not provide any information to such person unless Offeree and such
person enters into a non-disclosure agreement that is on substantially
similar terms to the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

        



  

 **SECTION 10.** ** Non-Solicitation of Employees**

  

During the Pre-Closing Period and, if the Transaction does not become
effective or, if made by a Takeover Offer in accordance with _Clause 5.2_
above, does not become or is not declared unconditional in all respects, for
a period of 6 months after the Transaction has lapsed or is otherwise
withdrawn, neither Offeror nor Offeree shall, and Offeror and Offeree shall
use all reasonable endeavours to procure that their Connected Persons do not,
solicit or endeavour to entice away any person who is at any time during the
negotiations relating to the Transaction and up to the Effective Time (or, of
a Takeover Offer is made, on the date the Takeover Offer becomes
unconditional in all respects) employed by either Offeror or Offeree or by
one of either Offerors or Offerees Group Undertakings and with whom
the other Party has come into contact as a result of negotiations relating to
the Transaction or is an employee at the senior vice president level
(or equivalent) or above, whether or not that person would commit any breach
of his or her contract of service in leaving such Partys employment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the restrictions in this _Clause 10_ shall not prohibit
Offeror or Offeree from engaging in discussions regarding the hiring or
employment of any person or from hiring or employing any person if
such discussions, hiring or employment are the result of either the response
of such person to the placement of any general advertisement for recruitment
purposes or such person contacting such Party on his or her own initiative
without any direct or indirect solicitation by such Party.

  

 **SECTION 11.** ** Inducement Fee**

Code, which is recommended by the Board of Offeree, and prior to the
Scheme or, as the case may be, Takeover Offer lapsing or being withdrawn, a
third party makes an announcement under Rule 2.5 of the Code of an offer

material part of the issued and to be issued share capital of the Offeree,
whether or not subject to any pre-condition ( **"** ** _Third Party Offer_
"**), (which term shall include any extended or revised Third Party Offer),
which shall include any other proposed takeover or merger transaction however
effected between or in relation to Offeree or any member of the Offeree
Group, and any person (other than Offeror or BidCo or any person acting in
concert with Offeror or BidCo in accordance with the Code) and the
Transaction does not become effective or, if implemented by way of Takeover
Offer, does not become or is not declared unconditional in all respects; or

  

 **(b) ** Offeror makes an Announcement in accordance with Rule 2.5 of the
Code, which is recommended by the Board of Offeree, and

  

 **(i) **if the Transaction is to be implemented by way of Takeover Offer,
one or more of the Board of Offeree subsequently withdraw or adversely modify
their favorable recommendation of the Takeover Offer; and

        



  

 **(ii) **the Takeover Offer does not become or is not declared unconditional
in all respects; or

  

 **(c) ** Offeror makes an Announcement in accordance with Rule 2.5 of the
Code which is recommended by the Board of Offeree and the Transaction is
to be implemented by way of Scheme, and the Board of Offeree fails to take
all steps reasonably appropriate and necessary to implement the Transaction.

  

 **11.3 **Offeree shall pay the Inducement Fee to Offeror within ten Business
Days of the occurrence of the Inducement Fee Payment Event together with
interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum above the base rate at the
relevant time of Barclays Bank Plc calculated on a daily basis from the date
that the Inducement Fee Payment Event occurs to the date that Offeree
actually makes payment to Offeror.

  

 **11.4 **Offeror intends, and shall use reasonable endeavours to secure,
that the Inducement Fee is not treated for VAT purposes as consideration for
a taxable supply. If, however, the Inducement Fee is treated for VAT purposes
in whole or part as consideration for a taxable supply by any tax authority
in respect of which Offeror (or the representative member of the group of
which Offeror is a member) is liable to account for VAT, then Offeror shall
issue a valid invoice to Offeree in respect of that supply and Offeree shall
(or shall procure that the representative member of the VAT group of which
Offeree is a member shall) use its reasonable endeavours to obtain any
available refund or credit in respect of such VAT. If and to the extent that
such VAT is recoverable (whether by way of credit or refund) by Offeree (or
the representative member of the group of which Offeree is a member) the
amount of the Inducement Fee (inclusive of amounts in respect of VAT) shall
be recoverable (whether by way of credit or refund) by Offeree (or the
representative member of the group of which Offeree is a member) and,
in satisfaction thereof, a sum equal to any amount so recovered shall be paid
to Offeror within five Business Days of making that recovery (whether by way
of credit or refund).

  

 **11.5 **Any sums payable under this Agreement shall be paid in full without
deduction or withholding and without regard to any lien, right of set-off,
counterclaim or otherwise.

  

 **11.6 **Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige Offeree to pay any amount
(including, but not limited to, damages) which the Panel determines would not
be permitted by Rule 21.2 of the Code.

  

 **11.7 **Termination of Obligations

  

 **(a) ** The Inducement Fee shall cease to be payable and all obligations
under this _Clause 11_  will terminate if:

  

 **(i) **Offeror fails to make the Announcement in accordance with Rule 2.5
of the Code in accordance with  _Clause 2.1_ ;

  

 **(ii) **Offeror makes the Announcement in accordance with Rule 2.5 of the
Code and the Scheme subsequently becomes effective or, should Offeror elect
to implement the Transaction by way of Takeover Offer, such Takeover Offer
subsequently becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects; or

        



  

 **(iii) **the Pre-Conditions or Conditions to the Transaction become
incapable of being satisfied (unless waived) due to the failure to obtain the
requisite anti-trust or competition law clearances (except where such failure
is due to Offerees failure to take all steps reasonably appropriate and
necessary to obtain such clearances).

  

 **SECTION 12.** ** Assignment**

  

This Agreement is personal to the parties to it and may not be assigned in
whole or in part without consent of the other Party except that either
Offeror or BidCo can assign this Agreement to an affiliate of Offeror without
the consent of Offeree.

  

 **SECTION 13.** ** Variation**

  

No variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and
signed by or on behalf of each of the Parties.

  

 **SECTION 14.** ** Time of the Essence**

  

Any time, date or period referred to in any provision of this Agreement may
be extended by mutual agreement between the Parties but as regards any time,
date or period originally fixed or any time, date or period so extended time
shall be of the essence.

  

 **SECTION 15.** ** Costs**

  

Save as provided in this Agreement, each Party shall bear all financial,
legal, accountancy and other costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
with this Agreement and the implementation of the Scheme and the Transaction.

  

 **SECTION 16.** ** Termination**

  

 **16.1 **Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this Agreement shall terminate with immediate effect and all rights
and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall, subject to
_Clause 16.4_ , cease immediately as follows:

  

 **(a) ** upon the mutual written consent of each of the Parties; or

  

 **(b) ** if the Transaction shall not have become effective by the Long-stop
Date, or, if Offeror elects to proceed by way of a Takeover Offer, such
Takeover Offer shall not have become or shall not have been
declared unconditional in all respects, in either case, on or before the
Long-stop Date or lapses in accordance with its terms or is not made; or

  

 **(c) ** if the Announcement is not released promptly following the signing
of this Agreement; or

  

 **(d) ** if the Pre-Conditions are not satisfied or, if applicable, waived
in accordance with their terms by the Pre-Condition Date; or

        



  

 **(e) ** if Offeror notifies Offeree in writing that, notwithstanding that
it has the right to waive the relevant Pre-Condition or Condition, it will
not do so; or

  

 **(f) **the Inducement Fee is paid or is payable under _Clause 11_ ; or

  

 **(g) ** upon a vote at a duly held meeting of the Offeree Shareholders or
any adjournment thereof, if the Resolutions required to be approved at such
meeting for the purposes of the Transaction shall be proposed and not
approved by the requisite majorities unless within 7 days Offeror has elected
to implement the Transaction by way of Takeover Offer in accordance with
_Clause 5.2(a)_ ; or

  

 **(h) ** if the Court declines or refuses to sanction the Scheme or the
Court Order(s) are not granted unless Offeror has previously elected to
implement the Transaction by way of Takeover Offer in accordance with _Clause
5.2(a)_ ; or

  

 **(i) **if Offeror elects to implement the Transaction by way of a Takeover
Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, if the Takeover Offer,
once announced under Rule 2.5 of the Code, lapses in accordance with its
terms or is withdrawn or not made; or

  

 **(j) **subject to the consent of the Panel, if required, **** upon breach
of _Clause 8_  of this Agreement which is material in the context of the
Transaction and the Offeree Group, and which, if capable of remedy, has not
been remedied within 15 Business Days of a notice from Offeror requesting the
same; or

  

 **(k) ** if the recommendation of the Board of Offeree contemplated by
_Clause 5.1(b) or 5.2(b)_ , as the case may be, is withdrawn at any time
prior to: (i) the Effective Date with respect to the Scheme; or (ii) the
Takeover Offer by Offeror becoming or being declared unconditional in all
respects, whichever is the later (and for the avoidance of doubt, during any
period between the Scheme having lapsed or having been withdrawn, and
the making of a Takeover Offer, the recommendation shall be deemed to
subsist unless it has been withdrawn in accordance with _Clause 5.2(b)_ );
or

  

 **(l) ** subject to the consent of the Panel if required, by one Party to
another Party, by written notice, following a material breach by such
other Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

 **16.2 **Save where the Inducement Fee is paid in accordance with _Clause
11_ , if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Clause 16.1(l)_ , the
non-defaulting Party shall be entitled to damages (but only limited to the
costs and expenses incurred as a result of the breach up to the date of
termination), provided that nothing shall obligate Offeree to pay any amount
that the Panel determines is not permitted by Rule 21.2 of the Code.

  

 **16.3 **Subject to any Legal Requirement to the contrary, Offeree
undertakes to Offeror and BidCo not to proceed with the Scheme and to
immediately withdraw the Scheme if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms at any time prior to the Hearing Date.

  

 **16.4 **_Clauses 10, 11, 16.2, 16.3 and 17 to 21 (inclusive)_ shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

 **SECTION 18.** ** ****Entire Agreement**

  

Save for the Non-Disclosure Agreement, this Agreement represents the entire
understanding, and constitutes the whole agreement in relation to its subject
matter and supersedes any previous agreement between the Parties with respect
thereto and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, excludes
any warranty, condition or other undertaking implied at law or by custom.

  

 **SECTION 19.** ** Miscellaneous**

  

 **19.1 **Neither Offeree nor the Board of Offeree shall be required by this
Agreement to take any action, continue to take any action, avoid taking any
action or cease taking any action (or direct that any other person should do
so) under _Clauses 5.1(b), 5.2(b) or 9.2(a)_ of this Agreement, if prior to
the Effective Time, the Board of Offeree determines in good faith, after
consultation with, and based upon independent legal advice from its legal
advisers, at a meeting of the Board of Offeree, that to take or continue to
take any such action or the failure to take any such action as required by
the Agreement would reasonably be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
directors of the Board of Offeree or their duties under the Code, and the
Board of Offeree has so notified the Offeror, in writing, of
this determination.

  

 **19.2 **If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any enactment or rule of law, but
would be valid and enforceable if deleted in whole or in part or reduced in
application, such provision shall apply with such deletion or modification as
may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable but the enforceability of
the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.

  

 **19.3 **If a party defaults in the payment when due of any sum payable
under this Agreement, its liability shall be increased to include interest
on such sum from the date when such payment is due until the date of actual
payment at a rate per annum of three percent (3%) above the base rate at the
relevant time of Barclays Bank Plc.

  

 **SECTION 20.** ** Third Party Rights**

  

No term of this Agreement is enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 by any person who is not a party to this Agreement.

        



  

 **SECTION 21.** ** Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

  

 **21.1 **This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of England. Each Party irrevocably agrees that the Courts of
England are to have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute which
may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement.

  

 **21.2 **Each Party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such Courts
and waives any objection to proceedings in any such Court on the ground of
venue or on the ground that the proceedings have been brought in an
inconvenient forum. This _Clause 21.2_ is for the benefit of each Party and
shall not limit its rights to take proceedings in any other court of
competent jurisdiction.

 **SCHEDULE 1**

  

 **SHARE SCHEME PROPOSAL**

  

 **1. **Offeror and Offeree agree that the options and awards under the
Employee Share Schemes held by employees (and former employees) of Offeree
relating to Offeree Shares should be dealt with in accordance with the terms
set out below.

  

 **2.** Offeree undertakes to Offeror to cooperate with and provide such
details to Offeror in relation to the Employee Share Schemes as Offeror
reasonably requires in order to plan and make proposals that comply with Rule
15 of the Code to the participants of the Employee Share Schemes (in addition
to the proposals set out in this **Schedule 1** ) and, if necessary,
to communicate with such participants in respect of such proposals. In
formulating such proposals, Offeror shall consult with Offeree. Offeror and
Offeree agree that such proposals will include a facility to exercise options
on a cashless basis and that, provided that such facility has been available
for a reasonable period of time prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the
Court, then such facility will not be available after that time.

  

 **3.** The Scheme will extend to Offeree Shares issued upon exercise of
options under the Employee Share Option Scheme where the Offeree Shares are
in issue at or prior to the Record Date. The Scheme will not extend to Offeree
Shares issued after the Record Date pursuant to the exercise of options under
the Employee Share Option Scheme. The articles of association of Offeree
will be amended so that any Offeree Shares issued after the Record Date
pursuant to the exercise of options under the Employee Share Option Scheme
will be acquired by Offeror on the same terms as provided for in the Scheme.

  

 **4.** Offeree agrees that options granted under the Employee Share Option
Scheme may be exercised notwithstanding that any performance target to which
they are subject has not been met. The remuneration committee of the Board of
Offeree has determined pursuant to the Transaction that Offeree Shares will
be released under the SurfControl Plc Long-term Incentive Plan (the " **
_LTIP_** ") to the extent that the performance target has been met at the
time of the Transaction without reduction to reflect the fact that the awards
have not been held for the full holding period applicable to the awards and
that award holders are not to be responsible for paying any employers
National Insurance contributions that will arise on the release of such
Offeree Shares or otherwise on the satisfaction of such awards. Prior to the
date on which the Scheme is sanctioned by the Court, the remuneration
committee will resolve all matters required for the application of the
performance condition applying to such awards taking into account all
relevant circumstances up to the date of such determination.

  

 **5. **Holders of options and awards under the Employee Share Schemes will
be sent details of these proposals or notified of the Scheme becoming
effective (as the case may be as provided by the rules of the relevant
Employee Share Scheme) as soon as reasonably practicable after the posting of
the Circular and in compliance with Rule 15 of the Code.

        



  

 **6.** As at the date of this Agreement, the trustee of the SurfControl Plc
General Employee Benefit Trust holds 1,505,512 Offeree Shares which will be
subject to the Scheme. Offeree confirms that there are agreements in place
under which the trustee has agreed to utilize such shares in the satisfaction
of awards under the LTIP and, to the extent that there are Offeree Shares
held following the satisfaction of such awards, and, to the extent permitted
by the terms of the trust deed governing such trust, in the satisfaction of
options exercised under the terms of the Employee Share Option Scheme prior
to the Scheme Effective Date. Offeree and Offeror agree to co-operate to
determine and implement reasonable steps to minimise (to the greatest extent
possible) any surplus assets arising in the SurfControl Plc General Employee
Benefit Trust following the release of Offeree Shares in satisfaction of
awards under the LTIP and, for the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable steps
may include making loans to the trustee to enable the trustee to acquire
shares from treasury at market value to satisfy outstanding options under the
Employee Share Option Scheme.  To the extent that surplus assets do arise,
Offeree shall recommend to the trustee that it utilizes any surplus assets of
the trust (following satisfaction of awards and options) in the satisfaction
of future incentive arrangements put into place by Offeror in respect of
trust beneficiaries. The obligations of the trust or of Offeree under this
paragraph 6 shall not apply to any surplus assets in the SurfControl Plc
General Employee Benefit Trust that are potentially required to satisfy any
obligations of that trust or of Offeree to make compensation payments to
former holders of awards under the LTIP whose employment with Offerees group
terminates after completion of the Transaction provided that the maximum
value of such surplus assets to which this paragraph 6 will not apply to for
this reason will be equal to the value of the LTIP awards that fail to vest
as a result of the Transaction.

  

 **7.** Offeror agrees that it will not take any action that would have the
effect of rendering ineffective any decisions made by the remuneration
committee of the Board of Offeree referred to in this Schedule 1.

  

 **8.** In the event that the Transaction is effected by means of a Takeover
Offer, the provisions of this Schedule 1 will apply with such amendments as
are necessary to take account of the revised structure of the Transaction.

Dear Sirs,

  

 **OFFER BY THE BIDDER FOR SURFCONTROL PLC (THE "TARGET")**

  

 **1.** ** **In this letter:

  

1.1 "Offer" means the proposed acquisition by the Bidder of the entire issued
and to be issued ordinary share capital of the Target whether implemented by
way of an offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares not already owned by
the Bidder (" **Takeover Offer** ") or by a scheme of arrangement ("
**Scheme** ") pursuant to section 425 of the Companies Act 1985 (the "
**Companies Act** ") substantially upon the terms and subject to the
conditions referred to in the draft announcement annexed to this undertaking
and marked "A" (the " **Offer Announcement** ").

  

1.2 " **Offer Document** " means the document containing the terms of the

2.2 If (subject to paragraph 2.3.7 below), I/we shall exercise my/our rights
to acquire ordinary shares of 10p of the Target pursuant to any interest in
the Target shares, as set out against my/our name in Part 2 of the Schedule,
I/we shall, in respect of all Committed Shares to which I/we become

2.3 Unless and until this undertaking lapses, I/we shall not:

  

2.3.1 sell or transfer (otherwise than pursuant to the Offer) or otherwise
dispose of or charge all or any of the Committed Shares or any interest in
all or any thereof; or

  

2.3.2 accept or undertake to accept any other offer or give any indication to
any third party of an intention to accept any other offer in any
circumstances in respect of all or any of the Committed Shares, whether
conditionally or unconditionally (by whatever means the same is to
be implemented) or vote in favour of any resolution to approve a compromise
or arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act with the members
and creditors of the Target and any third party other than the Bidder or
its parent, subsidiaries or fellow subsidiaries or their associated
companies, (a company in which a company owns or controls 20% or more of the
equity share capital) (the " **Bidder Group** "); or

        



  

2.3.3 withdraw the acceptance referred to in paragraph 2.1.1 notwithstanding
that I/we may have become entitled to do so by virtue of the City Code on

prevent any of the conditions to the Offer from being fulfilled; or

  

2.3.7 acquire shares or exercise any rights (including options) to acquire
shares in the Target without first notifying the Bidder and without the Panel
on Takeovers and Mergers (the **"Panel"** ) first being consulted by or on
behalf of the Bidder as to whether the acquisition or the exercise of such
rights in such circumstances would result in me/us being treated as acting in
concert with the Bidder or the Target and receiving confirmation from the
Panel that I/we will not be so treated (or alternatively receiving express
written consent from the Bidder, in its absolute discretion, that I may
nevertheless acquire such shares or exercise such rights); or

  

2.3.8 enter into any agreement or arrangement with any person, whether
conditionally or unconditionally, or solicit or encourage any person, to do
all or any of the acts referred to in this paragraph 2.3 or which would or
might restrict or impede my acceptance of the Offer or which would or might
restrict or impede me from complying with my obligations under this
undertaking;

  

2.4 Unless and until this undertaking lapses, I/we:

  

2.4.1 shall not exercise or permit the exercise of the voting rights
attaching to Committed Shares in any manner which would frustrate the Offer

sanctioning the scheme being filed with the Registrar of Companies (if it is
proceeding by way of a Scheme); and

association of the Target or to approve any acquisition by the Target of its
own shares or any resolution to approve any compromise or arrangement under
section 425 of the Companies Act with the members or creditors of the company
and any third party other than the Bidder and members of the Bidder Group.

  

2.5 The provisions set out in clauses 2.1, 2.2, 3 and 9 and apply equally to
the beneficial owners of the Committed Shares from whom I am/we are to
procure acceptance of the Offer or from whom I/we shall procure completion
and return of forms of proxy voting in favour of the Resolutions pursuant to
paragraph 2.1 and I/we shall procure the observance by such persons of such
provisions as if they were each specifically a party hereto.

  

 **3.** ** WARRANTIES**

  

I/We warrant that:

and any director of the Bidder to be my/our attorney in my/our name(s) and on
my/our behalf to execute a form or forms of acceptance and/or such other
documents and do such other acts and things (if any) as may be necessary to
