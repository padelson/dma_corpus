to any party or set of circumstances shall, in any jurisdiction and to any extent, be

a substitute provision which comes as close as possible to the invalidated or
unenforceable term or provision, and which puts each party in a position as nearly
comparable as possible to the position it would have been in but for the finding of
invalidity or unenforceability, while remaining valid and enforceable. </FONT></P>

hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. </FONT></P>

Agreement if the Board of Directors has withdrawn its recommendation for the adoption of
