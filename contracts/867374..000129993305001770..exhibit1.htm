<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U><B>MERGER AGREEMENT</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">THIS MERGER AGREEMENT, dated as of April&nbsp;14, 2005 (this &#147;<B><I>Agreement</I></B>&#148;), by and among Electronics
For Imaging, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B><I>Parent</I></B>&#148;), EFI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<B><I>Merger Sub</I></B>&#148;), and VUTEk, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the
&#147;<B><I>Company</I></B>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U>RECITALS</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">A.&nbsp;Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the &#147;<B><I>Merger</I></B>&#148;) of Merger Sub
with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the &#147;<B><I>DGCL</I></B>&#148;). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and the Company
will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">B.&nbsp;This Agreement and the Merger have been approved by the respective board of directors of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">C.&nbsp;The Stockholders holding a majority of the Company Common Stock intend to adopt this
Agreement pursuant to Section 251(c) of the DGCL by written consent in accordance with Section&nbsp;228
of the DGCL immediately after (and on the same day as) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE I



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U>THE MERGER</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.1 <U>The Merger</U>. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(the &#147;<B><I>Surviving Corporation</I></B>&#148;). As a result of the Merger, all of the respective outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company and Merger Sub will be converted or cancelled in the manner
provided in <U><B>Article&nbsp;II</B></U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.2 <U>Effective Time</U>. At the Closing, a certificate of merger (the &#147;<B><I>Certificate of Merger</I></B>&#148;)
will be duly prepared and executed by the Surviving Corporation and thereafter delivered to the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the &#147;<B><I>Secretary of State</I></B>&#148;) for filing, as provided in
Section&nbsp;103 of the DGCL, on the Closing Date. The Merger will become effective at the time of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, or at such later time as may be
agreed by Parent and the Company and stated in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time of such
filing (or stated later time, if any) being referred to herein as the &#147;<B><I>Effective Time</I></B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.3 <U>Closing</U>. The closing of the Merger (the &#147;<B><I>Closing</I></B>&#148;) will take place at the offices of
Kaye Scholer LLP, 425 Park Avenue, New York, New York on the Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in <U><B>Article&nbsp;VI</B></U> (other than those
conditions that are to be satisfied at the Closing), or on such other date or at such other time
and place as the parties mutually agree in writing (the &#147;<B><I>Closing Date</I></B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.4 <U>Effects of the Merger</U>. At the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger will be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.5 <U>Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Officers and Directors of the Surviving
Corporation</U>. (a)&nbsp;The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL, the certificate of
incorporation and/or the bylaws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;From and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the officers of the Surviving
Corporation will be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation and bylaws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.6 <U>Further Assurances</U>. Each party hereto shall execute such further documents and
instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be requested by one or more of the
others to consummate the Merger, to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of Merger Sub
or the Company, as applicable, or to otherwise effect the purposes of this Agreement.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE II



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U>PURCHASE PRICE AND CONVERSION OF SHARES</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">2.1 <U>Conversion of Capital Stock</U>. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(a) <U>Capital Stock of Merger Sub</U>. Each share of the common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (&#147;<B><I>Merger Sub Common Stock</I></B>&#148;) will be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (&#147;<B><I>Surviving
Corporation Common Stock</I></B>&#148;). Each certificate representing outstanding shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock will at the Effective Time represent an equal number of shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b) <U>Treasury Stock; Stock Owned by Parent</U>. All shares of capital stock of the
Company that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent will be
cancelled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered in exchange
therefor.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c) <U>Conversion of Company Common Stock</U>. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with <U><B>Section&nbsp;2.1(b)</B></U> and other than shares that are
Dissenting Shares) (each, a &#147;<B><I>Common Share</I></B>&#148;) will be converted into the right to receive an
amount per Common Share in cash equal to the Aggregate Per Share Consideration (as defined
below). At the Effective Time, all such Common Shares will no longer be outstanding and
will be cancelled automatically and will cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
representing a Common Share will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive in cash (i)&nbsp;the Per Share Amount upon the surrender of such Certificate
(or other evidence of ownership reasonably acceptable to Parent) in accordance with
<U><B>Section&nbsp;2.4</B></U> and (ii)&nbsp;payment of such holder&#146;s Per Share Portion of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount (or any remaining portion thereof) and Upward Adjustment Amount, if any,
pursuant to <U><B>Section&nbsp;2.6</B></U> and such holder&#146;s Per Share Portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount (or any remaining portion thereof), if any, pursuant to <U><B>Article&nbsp;VII</B></U>
(collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Aggregate Per Share Consideration</I></B>&#148;).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(d) <U>Dissenting Shares</U>. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock the holder of which has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL (in each case, a
&#147;<B><I>Dissenting Share</I></B>&#148;), will not be converted into a right to receive the Aggregate Per Share
Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or
her right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal, such shares of Company Common Stock
will be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to
receive the Aggregate Per Share Consideration pursuant to <U><B>Section&nbsp;2.1(c)</B></U>. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for
appraisal, and Parent shall conduct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer
to settle any such demands.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">2.2 <U>Payments</U>. At the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of the Company, shall (a)&nbsp;cause the
Company Debt outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be repaid to the lender or
lenders entitled thereto pursuant to the Payoff Letters (the &#147;<B><I>Payoff Letters</I></B>&#148;) and (b)&nbsp;pay the
Seller Expenses to the Persons entitled thereto in accordance with a certificate (the &#147;<B><I>Payment

exchanged as provided in this <U><B>Article&nbsp;II</B></U>, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U><B>Section&nbsp;2.1(c)</B></U>, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing shares cancelled pursuant to <U><B>Section&nbsp;2.1(c)</B></U>) will be deemed at

to the preparation or content of the Working Capital Statement or the Final Working Capital

contained in the Working Capital Statement that the Stockholder Representative disputes and the
basis for any such disputes. If the Stockholder Representative does not notify Parent of a dispute
with respect to the Working Capital Statement within such 30-day period, such Working Capital
Statement and the Final Working Capital reflected therein will be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties. In the event a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Parent, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such
dispute within 14&nbsp;days after the Stockholder Representative delivers the Notice of Disagreement,

Working Capital Statement and the Final Working Capital reflected therein require adjustment, which
determination shall be consistent with either the position of Parent or the position of the
Stockholder Representative or between the positions of Parent and the Stockholder Representative.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Arbitration Firm in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall share equally the fees and expenses of the Arbitration Firm. All
determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

Return by the Stockholder Representative or resolving any disputed item is not practicable because
of the filing deadline for such Tax Return, the Surviving Corporation shall file such Tax Return
and provide the Stockholder Representative with copies of such Tax Return, and the Stockholder

that such Taxes are reflected as a liability in the calculation of Final Working Capital and not
offset by a corresponding Tax asset reflected in such calculation. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Effective Time shall (i)&nbsp;in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending
on the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period
and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the
