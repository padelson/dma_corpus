 _MERGER AGREEMENT_     

THIS MERGER AGREEMENT, dated as of April 14, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), by
and among Electronics For Imaging, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), EFI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and VUTEk, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").   

 _RECITALS_     

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the "
_Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "). Upon
consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and the
Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.   

B. This Agreement and the Merger have been approved by the respective board of
directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.   

C. The Stockholders holding a majority of the Company Common Stock intend to
adopt this Agreement pursuant to Section 251(c) of the DGCL by written
consent in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL immediately after (and on
the same day as) the execution and delivery of this Agreement.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereby
agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

 _THE MERGER_     

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the
Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). As a result of the Merger, all of the respective outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company and Merger Sub will be converted or
cancelled in the manner provided in _Article II_.   

1.2 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") will be duly prepared and executed by the
Surviving Corporation and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ ") for filing, as provided
in Section 103 of the DGCL, on the Closing Date. The Merger will become
effective at the time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State, or at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company and stated in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time of
such filing (or stated later time, if any) being referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_ ").   

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at the offices of Kaye Scholer LLP, 425 Park Avenue, New York, New York on
the Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that are
to be satisfied at the Closing), or on such other date or at such other
time and place as the parties mutually agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_
").   

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger
will be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.   

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Officers and Directors of the
Surviving Corporation_. (a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL, the certificate
of incorporation and/or the bylaws.   

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws.   

1.6 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall execute such further
documents and instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be
requested by one or more of the others to consummate the Merger, to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of Merger Sub or
the Company, as applicable, or to otherwise effect the purposes of this
Agreement.   

ARTICLE II    

 _PURCHASE PRICE AND CONVERSION OF SHARES_     

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Stockholders:    

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") will be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Common
Stock_ "). Each certificate representing outstanding shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock will at the Effective Time represent an equal number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.    

(b) _Treasury Stock; Stock Owned by Parent_. All shares of capital stock of
the Company that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by
Parent will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange therefor.    

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other
than shares that are Dissenting Shares) (each, a " _Common Share_ ") will be
converted into the right to receive an amount per Common Share in cash equal
to the Aggregate Per Share Consideration (as defined below). At the Effective
Time, all such Common Shares will no longer be outstanding and will be
cancelled automatically and will cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate representing a Common Share will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive in cash (i) the Per Share Amount
upon the surrender of such Certificate (or other evidence of ownership
reasonably acceptable to Parent) in accordance with  _Section 2.4_ and (ii)
payment of such holders Per Share Portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(or any remaining portion thereof) and Upward Adjustment Amount, if
any, pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and such holders Per Share Portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (or any remaining portion thereof), if any, pursuant
to _Article VII_ (collectively, the " _Aggregate Per Share Consideration_
").    

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock the holder of
which has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who has demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the DGCL (in each case, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), will not
be converted into a right to receive the Aggregate Per Share Consideration
unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his
or her right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal, such shares
of Company Common Stock will be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Aggregate Per Share
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal,
and Parent shall conduct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands.   

2.2 _Payments_. At the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of the Company, shall
(a) cause the Company Debt outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be repaid to the lender or lenders entitled thereto pursuant to the
Payoff Letters (the " _Payoff Letters_ ") and (b) pay the Seller Expenses to
the Persons entitled thereto in accordance with a certificate (the "
_Payment Certificate_ ") to be delivered by the Company to Parent. In
addition, at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with (x) the Stockholder Representative, an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Per Share Amount and (ii) the
number of Common Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, as
reflected in the Payment Certificate by means of a wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the Stockholder Representative at least two Business Days prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Escrow Agent, the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Indemnity Escrow Amount to be held in an escrow account pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. Parents deposit of such amounts with
the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent shall satisfy in full
Parents obligation to pay such amounts to the Equityholders, and none of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
Equityholder for cash delivered to the Stockholder Representative and/or
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. As
promptly as possible prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver
the Payoff Letters and the Payment Certificate to Parent.   

2.3 _Settlement of Options and Warrants_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall notify the Optionholders, in writing, of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the applicable Option Plan. As of the
Effective Time, each outstanding Option shall be cancelled and retired by
virtue of the Merger and each Optionholder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive for each such
Option (other than the Tranche B Options) an amount per Option (without
interest and subject to applicable withholding tax as provided in _Section
2.4(d)_) in cash equal to (i) the Per Share Amount minus the exercise price
for such Option (the " _Per Option Amount_ ") and (ii) a Per Share Portion of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount (or any remaining portion thereof) and Upward
Adjustment Amount, if any, pursuant to  _Section 2.6_ and the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (or any remaining portion thereof) pursuant to  _Article VII_
(clauses (i) and (ii) together, the " _Aggregate Per Option Amount_ " and the
sum of all Aggregate Per Option Amounts to be received by all Optionholders
entitled thereto is referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). Payment
of the Per Option Amount to each of the Optionholders entitled thereto shall
be made by the Surviving Corporation, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and receipt by
the Surviving Corporation of the surrendered option agreements representing
the Options (other than the Tranche B Options) and a written instrument,
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, duly executed by such Optionholder setting
forth (i) a representation by such Optionholder that he or she is the owner
of all Options represented by such Option and (ii) a confirmation of, and
consent to, the cancellation of all of his or her Options. The Company shall
take all actions required under each Option Plan to cause such Option Plan to
terminate at the Effective Time, other than any Option Plan set forth in a
written notice delivered to the Company by Parent no later than ten
Business Days prior to the Closing instructing the Company not to terminate
such Option Plan pursuant to this _Section 2.3_(a). Payment of the remaining
portion of the Aggregate Per Option Amount to each Optionholder entitled
thereto shall be made by the Stockholder Representative as, if and when such
amounts are released or paid to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.   

(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Warrant shall be cancelled and
retired by virtue of the Merger and each Warrantholder shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive for each
such Warrant an amount per Warrant (without interest and subject to
applicable withholding tax as provided in _Section 2.4(d)_) in cash equal to
(i) the Per Share Amount minus the exercise price for such Warrant (the "
_Per Warrant Amount_ ") and (ii) a Per Share Portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount (or any remaining portion thereof) and Upward Adjustment Amount, if
any, pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and the Indemnity Escrow Amount (or
any remaining portion thereof) pursuant to _Article VII _(clauses (i) and
(ii) together, the " _Aggregate Per Warrant Amount_ " and the sum of all
Aggregate Per Warrant Amounts to be received by all Warrantholders is
referred to as the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). Payment of the Per
Warrant Amount to each of the Warrantholders shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time and receipt by the Surviving
Corporation of the surrendered warrant agreements representing the Warrants
and a written instrument, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, duly executed by
such Warrantholder setting forth (i) a representation by such Warrantholder
that he, she or it is the owner of all Warrants represented by such warrant
agreement and (ii) a confirmation of, and consent to, the cancellation of all
of his, her or its Warrants. Payment of the remaining portion of the Aggregate
Per Warrant Amount to each Warrantholder shall be made by the Stockholder
Representative as, if and when such amounts are released or paid to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.   

(c) Unless terminated pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, Parent shall assume the
Companys Nonqualified Stock Option Plan and to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law, the shares of Company Common Stock that remain available for
issuance under the Nonqualified Stock Option Plan as of the Effective Time
(the " _Reserved Shares_ ") shall be available for issuance pursuant to
awards issued by Parent following the Effective Time under the Nonqualified
Stock Option Plan; provided that such Reserved Shares shall be converted into
shares of common stock of Parent.   

2.4 _Payment and Surrender of Certificates_.   

(a) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, the Company shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates representing Common Shares (" _Certificates_ "): (i) a letter of
transmittal, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company (the
" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Amount. After the Effective
Time and upon surrender by the holder thereof to the Surviving Corporation of
(i) Certificates and (ii) a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the
Stockholder Representative shall pay to the holder of such Certificates
in exchange therefor (without interest) cash in an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Common Shares represented
by such Certificate and (B) the Per Share Amount, and the Certificate so
surrendered will forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the Per Share Amount payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.   

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company will be closed and thereafter there will be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Common Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, except as otherwise provided
by Applicable Law. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.1(c)_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares
cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_) will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender
the Aggregate Per Share Consideration that the holder thereof has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement.   

(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such
other reasonable conditions as Parent may impose, and, if required by the
Stockholder Representative, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Stockholder Representative may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Stockholder Representative shall, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay to the Person entitled thereto the Per
Share Amount due to such Person pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_.   

(d) _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Equityholder such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Equityholders in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   

2.5 _Pre-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. At least five days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good faith estimate
prepared by the Companys Chief Financial Officer (the " _Working Capital
Estimate_ ") of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (including
an estimate of all Seller Expenses) without giving effect to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the tax benefits or consequences thereof
and determined in accordance with Applicable Accounting Principles, together
with related supporting schedules, calculations and documentation and, if
any, the resulting estimate of Working Capital Overage or Working
Capital Underage, which Working Capital Estimate shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent. A " _Working Capital Overage_ " shall exist when (and
shall be equal to the amount by which) the Working Capital Estimate exceeds
the Target Working Capital, which amount shall be added to the
Merger Consideration as contemplated in the definition thereof contained in
_Article IX_. A " _Working Capital Underage_ " shall exist when (and shall
be equal to the amount by which) the Target Working Capital exceeds the
Working Capital Estimate, which amount shall be subtracted from the Merger
Consideration as contemplated in the definition thereof contained in _Article
IX_.    

2.6 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.   

(a) _Working Capital Statement_. As soon as practicable but in no event later
than 60 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Working Capital Statement_ ")
of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (including an estimate of
all Seller Expenses) without giving effect to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the tax benefits or consequences thereof and
determined in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles (the "
_Final Working Capital_ ").   

(b) _Dispute_. Within 30 days following receipt by the Stockholder
Representative of the Working Capital Statement, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver written notice (the " _Notice of Disagreement_
") to Parent of any dispute the Stockholder Representative has with
respect to the preparation or content of the Working Capital Statement or the
Final Working Capital reflected therein. The Notice of Disagreement must
describe in reasonable detail the items contained in the Working Capital
Statement that the Stockholder Representative disputes and the basis for any
such disputes. If the Stockholder Representative does not notify Parent of a
dispute with respect to the Working Capital Statement within such 30-day
period, such Working Capital Statement and the Final Working Capital
reflected therein will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In
the event a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Parent, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative, notwithstanding such
good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within 14 days after the
Stockholder Representative delivers the Notice of Disagreement, then Parent
and the Stockholder Representative jointly shall engage the Arbitration Firm
to resolve such dispute in accordance with the standards set forth in this
_Section 2.6(b)_. The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Arbitration Firm to render a written
decision resolving the matters submitted to the Arbitration Firm within
30 days of the making of such submission. The Arbitration Firm shall address
only those items in dispute. The Arbitration Firm shall determine, on such
basis, whether and to what extent, the Working Capital Statement and the
Final Working Capital reflected therein require adjustment,
which determination shall be consistent with either the position of Parent or
the position of the Stockholder Representative or between the positions of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Arbitration Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall share equally the fees and expenses of
the Arbitration Firm. All determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties.   

(c) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section 2.6_ , each party shall cooperate with and make available to the
other parties and their respective representatives all information, records,
data and working papers, and shall permit reasonable access to its facilities
and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Working Capital Statement and the Final
Working Capital reflected therein and the resolution of any disputes in
connection therewith.   

(d) _Downward Adjustment_. If the Final Working Capital (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_) is less than the Working Capital
Estimate, then the Merger Consideration will be adjusted downward by the
amount of such shortfall (the " _Downward Adjustment Amount_ "), and Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written authorization
to the Escrow Agent within two Business Days from the date on which the Final
Working Capital is finally determined instructing the Escrow Agent (i) to pay
to Parent an amount equal to the Downward Adjustment Amount (together with
any interest earned on such amount), first, out of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and, second, out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the extent (and only
to the extent) the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to cover the
entire Downward Adjustment Amount and (ii) to pay, after payment of the
Downward Adjustment Amount to Parent pursuant to clause (i), the remaining
portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, (together with any interest
earned on such amount), to the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Equityholders.   

(e) _Upward Adjustment_. If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_) is greater than the Working Capital Estimate,
then the Merger Consideration will be adjusted upward by the amount of such
excess (the " _Upward Adjustment Amount_ "), and (i) Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written authorization to the
Escrow Agent within two Business Days from the date on which the Final
Working Capital is finally determined instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to
the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, the entire
Adjustment Escrow Amount (together with any interest earned on such amount)
and (ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to an account designated in writing
by the Stockholder Representative an amount in cash equal to the Upward
Adjustment Amount together with interest on such amount at the 90-day LIBOR
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the Business Day
immediately preceding the date of such payment. The Upward Adjustment Amount
(including interest) shall be made to the Stockholder Representative within
five Business Days from the date on which the Final Working Capital is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_.   

(f) _No Adjustment_. If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to  _Section 2.6(b)_) is equal to the Working Capital Estimate,
there shall be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_ and Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver
joint written authorization to the Escrow Agent within two Business Days from
the date on which the Final Working Capital is finally determined instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount (together with
any interest earned on such amount) to the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of the Equityholders.   

ARTICLE III

3.1 _Organization of the Company; Authority; No Restrictions on Business

any agreement with standards bodies or other entities that would obligate the
Company to grant licenses to or otherwise impair its control of its
Proprietary Rights.   

(f) _Protection of Proprietary Rights_. All of the pending applications for

appropriate (including entering into necessary and appropriate
confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement with officers, employees,
subcontractors, licencees and customers in connection with the Companys
business) to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of Trade
Secrets that are material to the Companys business. Each officer and employee

following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, submit all filings
required by the HSR Act (the " _HSR Filing_ ") to the United
States Department of Justice, as appropriate and thereafter provide any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the
HSR Act and make any similar filing within, to the extent reasonably
practicable, a similar time frame with any other Governmental Authority for
which such filing is required. Any such notification and report form and

and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act
or other applicable antitrust regulation. Parent and the Company shall

and the Company shall each pay one-half of the filing fees under the HSR
Act.   

5.7 _Notice of Events_. (a) During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing if Parent becomes aware of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact or
condition that would cause or constitute a breach of any of its
representations or warranties contained herein had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of Parents discovery of such event, fact
or condition and (ii) any material failure on its part to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder.   

(b) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement (the " _Updating Period_
"), the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing if the Company
becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event occurring
or not occurring, as the case may be, during the Updating Period or the
existence of any fact or condition arising during the Updating Period that
would cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations or
warranties contained herein had such representation or warranty been made as
of the time of the Companys discovery of such event, fact or condition and
(ii) any material failure on its or the Stockholder Representatives part to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied during the Updating Period by it or the Stockholder
Representative hereunder. Should any such event, fact or condition require any
change to the Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall promptly deliver to
Parent a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule specifying such change.   

(c) In the event that the Company delivers one or more supplements to the
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to _Section 5.7(b)_ that reflect any events,
facts or conditions which would, individually or in the aggregate, cause the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ or  _6.2(b)_ not to be satisfied
and Parent does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement on the
basis of such supplemented Disclosure Schedule, within ten Business Days
of Parents receipt of any such supplement to the Disclosure Schedule, Parent
will be deemed to have accepted such supplemented Disclosure Schedule, the
delivery of any such supplement will be deemed to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant that otherwise might
have existed hereunder by reason of such events, fact or condition and, from
and after the Effective Time and no Buyer Indemnitee will have any claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_ for any such events, facts or
conditions.   

5.8 _Officer and Director Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and
Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liability for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees
of the Company and the Subsidiaries, as provided in the respective
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or in indemnification agreements,
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms for a period of not less than six
years after the Closing Date.   

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain, at the expense of Parent or the Surviving Corporation expense, a non-
cancellable run-off insurance policy, for a period of six years after the
Closing Date, to provide insurance coverage for events, acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date for all persons who were directors
or officers of the Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing
Date.   

5.9 _Tax Covenants_. (a) The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Effective Time which are required to be filed after the Effective Time. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of
the Company in preparing its Tax Returns to the extent such past practice
conforms with applicable Tax laws. The Surviving Corporation shall submit
such Tax Returns to the Stockholder Representative no later than 30 Business
Days prior to the due date for filing thereof and shall permit
the Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the second preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make
such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
consult with each other and attempt in good faith to resolve any issues
arising as a result of such Tax Returns and, if they are unable to do so, the
disputed items shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into
account the deadline for filing such Tax Return) by the Arbitration Firm.
Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Returns shall be timely
filed on that basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the timing for
reviewing and/or commenting on any Tax Return by the Stockholder
Representative or resolving any disputed item is not practicable because of
the filing deadline for such Tax Return, the Surviving Corporation shall file
such Tax Return and provide the Stockholder Representative with copies of
such Tax Return, and the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to
review and comment on such Tax Return, and refer any disputed item to the
Arbitration Firm for resolution, and where appropriate, request the
Surviving Corporation to file amended Tax Returns. Subject to the limitations
of _Section 7.5(c)(ii)_, the Surviving Corporation shall be reimbursed out
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, within 15 days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect
to such Tax Returns as initially filed, an amount equal to such Taxes of each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such Tax Returns as
initially filed, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected as a
liability in the calculation of Final Working Capital and not offset by a
corresponding Tax asset reflected in such calculation.   

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin before the Effective Time and end
after the Effective Time (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company in
preparing its Tax Returns to the extent such past practice conforms with
applicable Tax laws. The Surviving Corporation shall submit such Tax Returns
to the Stockholder Representative no later than 30 Business Days prior to the
due date for filing thereof and shall permit the Stockholder Representative
to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the second
preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative. The
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall consult with each other and
attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of such Tax
Returns and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items shall be
resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such Tax Return) by the Arbitration Firm. Upon resolution of all such
items, the relevant Tax Returns shall be timely filed on that
basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the timing for reviewing and/or
commenting on any Tax Return by the Stockholder Representative or resolving
any disputed item is not practicable because of the filing deadline for such
Tax Return, the Surviving Corporation shall file such Tax Return and provide
the Stockholder Representative with copies of such Tax Return, and the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to review and comment on such
Tax Return, and refer any disputed item to the Arbitration Firm for
resolution, and where appropriate, request the Surviving Corporation to file
amended Tax Returns. Subject to the limitations of _Section 7.5(c)(ii)_, the
Surviving Corporation shall be reimbursed out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
and pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, within 15 days after the
date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such Tax Returns as initially
filed, an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
portion of such Taxable period ending on the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such Taxes are reflected as a liability in the calculation of
Final Working Capital and not offset by a corresponding Tax asset reflected
in such calculation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of
any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Effective Time shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other
than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Tax period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the relevant Tax period ended on the Effective Time.   

(c) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders, the Stockholders
Representative, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Stockholders further agree,
upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).   

(d) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the parties hereto agree to
cause state and local Tax periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
closed at the close of business on the Closing Date. Parent agrees that, as
of the day following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall become
a member of the "affiliated group" of corporations of which Parent is
a member, as defined in Code Section 1504(a), and shall be included in a
federal consolidated income Tax Return that will be filed by such affiliated
group for a taxable period that will include the day following the Closing
Date.   

(e) The Surviving Corporation and Parent agree not to cause the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to engage in any transaction on the Closing Date after
the Effective Time that is outside of the ordinary course of business, except
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall make an election under Code
Section 338 with respect to Company or any stock that is held, directly or
indirectly, by Company without Stockholder Representatives prior written
consent.   

(g) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a form of notice to the IRS in
accordance with the requirements of Treasury regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2)
and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent along with written
authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to the IRS on behalf of
the Company upon the Closing of the Merger.   

5.10 _Company s Auditors_. (a) The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its management and independent auditors to facilitate on a
timely basis (i) the preparation of financial statements (including pro forma
financial statements if required) as required by Parent to comply with
applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and (ii) the review
of any Company or predecessor audit work papers, including, as applicable,
the review of selected interim financial statements and data.   

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the audit of the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2004 and the related audited consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal year
then ended, including the notes thereto (the " _Audited Financial Statements_
"), completed as promptly as practicable, which Audited Financial Statements
will (i) be prepared from the books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated and
(iii) be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the
period covered thereby. The Company shall provide Parent with a preliminary
draft of the Audited Financial Statements as soon as they are available. The
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make inquiries
regarding, or provide comments to, the draft of the Audited Financial
Statements and shall respond as promptly as practicable to such inquires and
shall take into reasonable consideration such comments before completing the
Audited Financial Statements.   

5.11 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. None of the Company or any Subsidiary
shall, directly or indirectly, take (and the Company shall not authorize or
permit its directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives or, to the extent within
the Companys control, other Affiliates to take) any action to (a) encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), solicit, initiate or
facilitate any Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter into any agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (c)
participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
any information to, any Person in connection with, or take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. Upon
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and
promptly request that all confidential information with respect thereto
furnished on behalf of the Company be returned.   

5.12 _401(k) Plan Termination_. Unless Parent notifies Company otherwise in
writing prior to the Effective Time, the Companys board of directors shall
adopt resolutions terminating, effective at least two days prior to the
Effective Time, any Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of
Section 401(k) of the Code (each such Plan, a " _4_ _01(k)_ _Plan_ "). Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent (a) executed resolutions of
the Companys board of directors authorizing such termination, (b) an
executed amendment to each such 401(k) Plan intended to assure compliance
with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder and

distribution of benefits thereunder other than single lump sums. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide any and all notice of such
401(k) Plan termination as may be required by the terms of such 401(k) Plan
or obtain waivers of such notice.   

5.13 _Submission to Stockholders_. Immediately after (and on the same day as)

this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be rescinded following

party thereto (other than Parent or Merger Sub).

Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders and their respective heirs
and personal representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ")
for, and will pay to the Seller Indemnitees the amount of any, Damages
actually incurred by a Seller Indemnitee arising out of (a) any breach of any

Parent notifies the Stockholder Representative of a claim for Damages in
accordance with _Section 7.7_.   

(b) Following the Effective Time, the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled

18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative
notifies Parent of a claim for Damages in accordance with _Section 7.7_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to
the obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub to make payments under _Article
II_.   

7.5 _Limitation on Amount of Indemnification of Buyer Indemnities_. (a) The
Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification with respect to the
matters described in  _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than in connection with a
breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.12_) or
_Section 7.2(b)(i)_ unless and until the total of all such Damages suffered
by the Buyer Indemnitees under such Sections exceeds the sum of $1,000,000
(the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Equityholders will be liable for all
Damages (including the initial $1,000,000 thereof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no claim for indemnification with respect to the matters described
in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than in connection with a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.12_) or _Section
7.2(b)(i)_ may be made, pursuant to this _Article VII_, unless the amount of
such claim shall exceed $10,000, and if such claim does not exceed such
amount, the amount of such claim shall not be taken into account in
determining whether or not or to the extent to which the Basket has been
exceeded. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 7.5_, in no
event shall (i) the Equityholders be liable for Damages pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)_ which exceed, in the aggregate, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and (ii)
any Equityholder be liable for Damages under this _Article VII_ in excess of
such Equityholders Proportionate Percentage of the Merger
Consideration.   

(b) All claims for Damages made by any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)_ shall be satisfied solely out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, subject
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Claims for Damages made by any Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ may (but need not) be satisfied out
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Damages disbursed to a Buyer Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount in connection with a claim made pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ shall
reduce (by the amount of such Damages) the maximum liability of the
Equityholders for indemnification claims made by the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)_ (other than with respect to _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ in connection with a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.12_ or _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ in connection with a
breach of the covenants in _Section 5.9_).   

(c) The Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_
on account of any Damages shall (i) be reduced by all insurance or other
third party indemnification proceeds actually received by the Buyer
Indemnitees net of any Taxes payable by the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to
such proceeds and (ii) in the case of Damages arising from any breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12_ or the
covenants set forth in  _Section 5.9_, (1) be reduced by the reserve for
Taxes set forth in Section 7.5(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and (2) be
reduced by any Taxes reflected as a liability in the calculation of Final
Working Capital and not offset by a corresponding Tax asset reflected in such
calculation. Parent and the Companies shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to claim and recover any Damages suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees
under any such insurance policies or other third party indemnities.   

7.6 _Limitation on Amount  Parent and Surviving Corporation_. (a) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will have no liability (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to the matters described in _Section 7.3_ unless and
until the total of all such Damages suffered by the Seller Indemnitees under
such Section exceeds the sum of $1,000,000 (the " _Buyer Basket_ "), in
which event Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be liable for all
Damages (including the initial $1,000,000 thereof) up to a maximum of
$15,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no claim for indemnification with
respect to the matters described in _Section 7.3_ may be made, pursuant to
this _Article VII_, unless the amount of such claim shall exceed $10,000, and
if such claim does not exceed such amount, the amount of such claim shall not
be taken into account in determining whether or not or to the extent which
the Buyer Basket has been exceeded;  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that
neither the Buyer Basket nor the foregoing limitations shall apply to the
obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub to make payments under  _Article
II_.   

(b) The Seller Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
7.3_ on account of any Damages shall be reduced by all insurance or other
third party indemnification proceeds actually received by the Seller
Indemnitees net of any Taxes payable by the Seller Indemnitees with respect
to such proceeds. The Seller Indemnitees shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Damages suffered by
the Seller Indemnitees under any such insurance policies or other third party
indemnities.   

7.7 _Procedures_.   

(a) _Notice of Damages by Seller Indemnitee_. As soon as is reasonably
practicable after a Seller Indemnitee obtains knowledge of any Damages for
which any Seller Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 7.3_, the Stockholder Representative shall give written notice of
such Damages (a " _Seller Claims Notice_ ") to Parent describing the Damages
in reasonable detail, and indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to
the extent feasible) of the Damages that has been or may be suffered by the
applicable Seller Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Seller Claims
Notice by the Stockholder Representative to Parent pursuant to this  _Section
7.7(a)_ will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that
the Stockholder Representative has under this Agreement, or alter or relieve
Parent or the Surviving Corporation of their obligation to indemnify the
applicable Seller Indemnitee except to the extent that they are materially
prejudiced thereby.    

(b) _Notice of Damages by Buyer Indemnitee_.   

(i) (1) _Claims for Indemnification Against the Indemnity Escrow Amount_.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_, if any Buyer
Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a claim for indemnification
against the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_7.2(b)_ (an " _Escrow Claim_ "), Parent shall, promptly after it becomes
aware of such Escrow Claim, notify the Stockholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent of such Escrow Claim by means of a written notice (an " _Escrow
Claims Notice_ ") specifying the nature, circumstances and amount of such
Escrow Claim accompanied by an affidavit of the Chief Executive Officer or
Chief Financial Officer of the Surviving Corporation setting forth with
reasonable particularity the underlying facts actually known or in good faith
believed by the affiant to exist sufficient to establish, as of the date of
such affidavit, the basis for the Escrow Claim and setting forth Parents
good faith calculation of the Damages incurred by the applicable
Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto. The failure by Parent to promptly
deliver an Escrow Claim Notice under this _Section 7.7(b)(i)(1)_ will not
adversely affect the applicable Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount except to the extent the
Stockholder Representative is materially prejudiced thereby. If, by 5:00 p.m.
New York time on the 30th day following receipt by the Stockholder
Representative of an Escrow Claim Notice (the " _Dispute Period_ "), Parent
and the Escrow Agent have not received from the Stockholder Representative
notice in writing that the Stockholder Representative objects to the Escrow
Claim (or the amount of Damages set forth therein) asserted in such Escrow
Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), the Escrow Agent shall disburse to
Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Amount the amount of Damages specified
in the Claim Notice subject to the limitations contained in this _Article
VII_.   

(2) _Escrow Claim Disputes_. If the Stockholder Representative delivers a
Dispute Notice to Parent within the Dispute Period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall promptly meet and use their reasonable
efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and to what extent the Buyer
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification on account of such Escrow Claim.
If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are able to reach agreement
within 30 days after Parent receives such Dispute Notice, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent setting forth such agreement and instructing the Escrow Agent to
release funds from the Indemnity Escrow Amount subject to the limitations
contained in this _Article VII_. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after Parent
receives such Dispute Notice, then the dispute may be submitted to a court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 7.7(b)_ by either Parent or the
Stockholder Representative. For all purposes of this _Article VII_, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate with and make available to
the other party and its respective representatives all information, records
and data, and shall permit reasonable access to its facilities and personnel,
as may be reasonably required in connection with the resolution of such
disputes.   

(ii) _Claims for Indemnification Against the Equityholders_. As soon as is
reasonably practicable after a Buyer Indemnitee obtains knowledge of any
Damages for which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ (other than claims pursuant to _Section
7.2(b)_ for which such Buyer Indemnitee elects to seek
indemnification against the Indemnity Escrow Amount), Parent shall give
written notice of such Damages (a " _Buyer Claims Notice_ ") to the
Stockholder Representative describing the Damages in reasonable detail,
and indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible)
of the Damages that has been or may be suffered by the applicable Buyer
Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Buyer Claims Notice by Parent to
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)(ii)_ will
adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that Parent has under
this Agreement, or alter or relieve the Equityholders of their obligation to
indemnify the applicable Buyer Indemnitee except to the extent that they are
materially prejudiced thereby.   

(c) _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_. In the event of any claim by
a third party against any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee for which
indemnification is available under this _Article VII_ (whether pursuant to a
lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
party against whom indemnification may be sought hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be entitled and, if it so elects, shall be
obligated at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of the
defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim and (ii) to pursue the
defense thereof in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings
promptly taken or instituted and diligently pursued, including, without
limitation, to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice reasonably
acceptable to the party seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") to handle and defend such Third Party Claim, and (b) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but not obligated), if it so elects, to
compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made
only with the written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Third Party Claim related
to Taxes, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders,
shall be entitled and, if the Stockholder Representative so elects, shall be
obligated at its own cost, risk and expense to control the conduct and
resolution of any Tax Contest solely with respect to any Taxes that would be
subject to indemnification under _Article VII_, _provided_ , that if any of
the issues raised in such Tax Contest could have a material impact on Taxes
of the Surviving Corporation for a Tax period or portion thereof beginning on
or after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "), or that are not
subject to indemnification under _Article VII_, then the Stockholder
Representative shall afford the Buyer Indemnitees the opportunity to
control jointly the conduct and resolution of the portion of such Tax Contest
which could have a material impact on Taxes of the Surviving Corporation in
any Post-Closing Tax Period or that are not subject to indemnification under
_Article VII_; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party
controlling the defense of a Third Party claim is the
Stockholder Representative, the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be
necessary in connection with any compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim that solely involves the payment of monetary damages not exceeding an
amount equal to the then remaining portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount 
_minus_ the sum of all Damages claimed under then pending (but unresolved)
Escrow Claims Notices and do not impact the Taxes or Tax positions of the
Surviving Corporation for any Post-Closing Tax Period. In the event the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense and investigation
of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 7.7(c)_, the
Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the
investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim, _provided_ that
if the named Persons to a lawsuit or other legal action include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party has
been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled,
at the Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense, to retain one firm of
separate counsel of its own choosing (along with any required local
counsel). If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 7.7(c)_ within 14 days after
delivery of the Claim Notice in connection with such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted
shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party) have
the right to undertake the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any resulting
settlement of such Third Party Claim and for any final judgment with respect
thereto (subject to any right of appeal), if any, but only to the full
extent otherwise provided in this Agreement. In the event the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense,
compromise or settlement, and in the event the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying
Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement.   

(d) _Defense of the Garcia Litigation and DuPont Litigation_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.7(c)_:   

(i) The Stockholder Representative shall control the defense of the DuPont
Litigation until final adjudication or settlement thereof with the respective
attorneys handling such defenses as of the date of this Agreement or such
other attorneys of its own choice reasonably acceptable to Parent. The
Stockholder Representative shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
progress of such defense and any compromise or settlement of the DuPont
Litigation. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to compromise or
settle the DuPont Litigation only with the written consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
the consent of Parent shall not be necessary in connection with any
compromise or settlement of the DuPont Litigation that solely involves the
payment of monetary damages and includes a full release of the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries.   

(ii) Parent shall control the defense of the Garcia Litigation until final
adjudication or settlement thereof with the respective attorneys handling
such defenses as of the date of this Agreement or such other attorneys of its
own choice reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder Representative. Parent
shall keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed of the progress
of such defense and any compromise or settlement of the Garcia Litigation.
Parent shall be entitled to compromise or settle the Garcia Litigation only
with the written consent of the Stockholder Representative, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   

7.8 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Any payments made pursuant to this
_Article VII_ shall be construed as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration.   

ARTICLE VIII    

 _TERMINATION_     

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions

circumstances rendering such condition(s) incapable of fulfillment; provided,
that, if Parent elects to terminate this Agreement as a result of one or more
supplements to the Disclosure Schedule delivered to Parent by the Company
pursuant to _Section 5.7(b),_ Parent shall be required to do so within
the time period specified therefor in _Section 5.7(c)_; or
