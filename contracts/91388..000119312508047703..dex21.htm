contributions for plan years ending on or before December 31, 2006, that are
required to be made before the Closing Date have been or will be made prior

Affiliate or any organization to which Seller is a successor or parent

Department of Labor, the PBGC or any other governmental agency (federal, state
or local) and such have been filed and paid on a timely basis, except in each
instance in which the failure to file such reports, returns and other
documents would not have, alone or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in _Exhibit 3.15_ attached hereto, no material
lawsuits, complaints, investigations or proceedings to or by any Person have
been publicly filed or commenced or, to the Knowledge of Seller, are proposed
or threatened, with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

Time of Closing there will be no bonuses, profit sharing, incentives,
commissions or other compensation of any kind, including severance benefits,

-32-  any Company Employees with respect to employment or termination of
employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time of Closing, which have not been fully paid, or accrued in the Final
Statement of Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such payments
or accruals shall be required with respect to any such amounts (including,
without limitation, severance benefits) that become due and payable as a
result of actions taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after
the Closing Date. Except as set forth in _Exhibit 3.15_ attached hereto, no
severance pay obligation under any Employee Benefit Plan, Contract or at Law,
with respect to Company Employees, will be triggered solely by the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Neither the Company and its Subsidiaries
nor the Buyer, solely as a result of the purchase of the Stock by Buyer, shall
be obligated to make a payment to an individual that would be a "parachute
payment" to a "disqualified individual" (as those terms are defined in
Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable
compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the
future).

Subsidiaries to comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws and

Buyer admits in writing to Seller that such claim is covered by the
indemnity provisions of _Section 8.2(a)_ hereof, Buyer shall have the right
to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings such claim and to
control all settlements (unless Seller agrees to assume the cost of settlement
and to forgo such indemnity) and to select lead counsel to defend any and all
such claims at the sole cost and expense of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer may not, without the consent of the indemnified party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), enter into any settlement or
consent to entry of any judgment that (i) does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to the
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability with respect
to such claim (and any potential similar or analogous claims), (ii) involves

applicable, pursuant to the Supplemental Plan and the Five Rivers LLC
Supplemental Plan, reduced by the value of the tax deduction allowable to the
Company or a Subsidiary with respect to those benefits, plus any employment
taxes imposed on the Company or Five Rivers LLC, as applicable, that are paid
by the Company with respect to those benefits.



 

-61- (c) Buyer shall establish or designate a defined contribution plan that
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Buyers
Plan"). Buyer agrees that employees of the Company or a Subsidiary who
participate in the Smithfield Foods 401(k) Plan and the Smithfield Foods
Bargaining 401(k) Plan (the "Sellers Plans") shall be permitted to rollover
their accounts in the Sellers Plans to the Buyers Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such rollover shall be conditioned upon receipt by Buyer,
with respect to each Sellers Plan, of (i) a copy of the most recent
favorable IRS determination letter for such Sellers Plan, or (ii) a letter
from the Seller stating that such Sellers Plan is intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code that a request for a favorable
determination letter with respect to the Sellers Plan is pending with the IRS

would result in the disqualification of the Sellers Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code; and _provided further_ , that such rollovers shall be in
cash or cash and the promissory note evidencing any outstanding participant
loan. With respect to any such employee who has an outstanding participant

Sellers Plans, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to withhold
payments on such loans from the employees compensation and to promptly remit
the withholdings to the Sellers Plans; _provided_ , that Seller provides to

amounts that are required to be withheld from each employees compensation in
a timely manner.

Section 8.4. _WARN Matters_. Buyer acknowledges that the employment related
actions by the Company and its Subsidiaries before Closing may be considered
in conjunction with any  



 

-62-  other "employment loss" (within the meaning of WARN) or other actions by the
Company and its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date to result in a
"mass layoff" or "plant closing" within the meaning of WARN. Subject to the
following sentence, Buyer agrees to be solely responsible for, and to
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from, all liabilities and
obligations, including attorneys fees, under WARN or any other Law requiring
notice prior to termination of employment, and the payment of severance pay,
wages or benefits, subject to _Section 8.3(b)_ hereof, as a result of or with
respect to (a) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) layoffs,
employment terminations or other employment related actions or omissions
occurring after the Closing Date (whether such actions alone or in conjunction
with the employment related actions by the Company and its Subsidiaries
before Closing give rise to such liabilities or obligations) and (c) layoffs,
employment terminations or other employment related actions or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date, if such liabilities or obligations arise
as a result of "employment loss" (within the meaning of WARN) or other actions
taken by Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date. Buyers commitment in the preceding sentence is contingent upon (i)
Seller providing Buyer with a list of all employees whose employment has been
individually terminated or who have been laid off or otherwise suffered an
employment loss within the 90-day period preceding the Closing, such list to
be provided at least 10 days prior to the Closing and updated and delivered to
Buyer on the Closing Date and (ii) Sellers satisfaction of its obligations
under clause (c) of _Section 5.2_ hereof.

not including any Income Taxes) in connection  



 

-63-  with the effectuation of the transfer of the Stock, whether imposed on
Buyer, Seller or the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be paid by Buyer. The

Taxes contemplated by this Section and shall provide such documentation and
take such other actions as may be necessary to minimize the amount of any such
Taxes.

(b) _Federal Income Taxes in General_.

(i) The income and other Tax items of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
periods ending on or before the Closing Date shall be included in the
consolidated Federal Income Tax Return of the affiliated group, within the
meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, of which Seller is a member (the
"Seller Tax Group"). Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.5_,
Seller shall be responsible for and shall hold Buyer harmless from any Federal
Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any amount
payable by reason of Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or successor regulation of
similar import) to the extent not paid before Closing, and shall be entitled
to any reductions in such Taxes or refunds (including interest), for taxable
periods ending on or before or, with respect to the consolidated Federal
Income Tax Return of the Seller Tax Group, including the Closing Date. If
Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives any such refund,
Buyer shall promptly pay (or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay)
the entire amount of the refund (including interest) to Seller.

(ii) Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for and
shall indemnify and hold Seller and the Seller Tax Group harmless from
all Federal Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date and, with respect to prior taxable

-64-  from any action taken without Sellers written consent by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the
Closing (including, without limitation, actions taken outside the ordinary
course of business and occurring on the Closing Date). Buyer and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to all refunds of such Taxes (including
interest).

(c) _State Income Taxes in General_.

(i) Seller shall be responsible for preparing and filing the State Income Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section

Subsidiaries (including any amount payable by reason of any applicable
provision of state income Tax Law similar to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6),
to the extent not paid before Closing, and shall be entitled to any reductions
in such Taxes or refunds (including interest) for such taxable periods. If
Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives any such refund,
Buyer shall promptly pay (or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay)
the entire amount of such refund (including interest) to Seller.

(ii) Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for and
shall indemnify and hold Seller and the Seller Tax Group harmless from
all State Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable

Sellers written consent by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing (including, without
limitation, actions taken outside the ordinary course of business and
occurring on the Closing Date). Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be entitled to all refunds of such Taxes (including interest).



 

-65- (iii) If any of the Company and its Subsidiaries is required to file any State
Income Tax Return for a taxable period covering days before and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause such Tax Return to be filed and shall be
responsible for the payment of any State Income Tax for such period. However,
Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as appropriate and as
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, the amount by which the State
Income Tax attributable to the period through the Closing Date exceeds or is
less than the amount of such Tax paid (including payments of estimated Tax)
on or before the Closing Date. The State Income Tax attributable to the period
through the Closing Date shall be determined (A) as if that period were a
separate taxable year, and (B) except as otherwise required by Law, by using
the Tax accounting methods and Tax elections used by the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Closing Date. Buyer shall compute the amount of the
State Income Tax attributable to the period through the Closing Date and shall
notify Seller of such amount in writing no later than 30 days prior to the
filing of any such State Income Tax Return. Within the 30-day period
thereafter, Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as
appropriate, the difference between (w) the amount of State Income Tax
determined by Buyer as attributable to the portion of the period through the
Closing Date, and (x) the amount of the State Income Tax for the taxable
period paid (including payments of estimated Tax) on or before the Closing
Date, unless within 30 days after such notification date, Seller notifies
Buyer in writing that Seller disagrees with the computation of any such
amount. In that case, Seller and Buyer shall proceed in good faith to
determine the correct amount, and Sellers payment to Buyer, or Buyers
payment to Seller, shall be due the later of (y) the time specified in the
immediately preceding sentence or (z) 10 days after Seller and Buyer agree to
the amount payable. 



 

-66- (d) _Section 338G_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the parties agree that, if Buyer makes an election under Section 338(g) with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall prepare and
file the returns for, be responsible for the payment of, indemnify and hold
Seller harmless from, and be entitled to any refund (excluding any refund
resulting from carrying back a loss or other Tax item to a period ending on or
before the Closing Date) of any Taxes resulting from the election (and any
corresponding election under state Law). 

(e) _Cooperation_.

(i) Buyer agrees to cooperate and to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to cooperate with Seller to the extent reasonably required after the Closing
Date in connection with (A) the filing, amendment, preparation and execution
of all Federal Income Tax Returns and State Income Tax Returns with respect
to any taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ending on or
before the Closing Date, (B) contests concerning the Federal Income Tax or
State Income Tax due for any such period and (C) audits and other proceedings
relating to such Income Taxes with respect to any such period. Within a
reasonable time (but not more than 10 days) after Buyer, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries receives official notice of any such contest, audit or other
proceeding, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such contest, audit or
other proceeding. In any case where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
responsible under applicable Law for the defense of such contest, audit or
other proceeding, Seller shall have the right to conduct the defense at its
expense, whether such contest, audit or other proceeding commenced before or
commences after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding  



 

-67-  Sellers obligations under the preceding provisions of this _Section 8.5_,
Seller shall have no obligation to pay or to indemnify or hold Buyer or the
Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any Income Tax imposed or assessed
as a result of (x) the failure of Buyer to notify Seller as required by this
paragraph, if such failure adversely affects Sellers ability to respond
adequately in a timely manner to the notice of contest, audit or other
proceeding, or (y) any action taken by Buyer or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any contest, audit or other proceeding without
Sellers written consent.

(ii) The amount of any Income Tax indemnification otherwise payable by Seller
under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount or, in the case of a Tax
benefit to be realized subsequently, the then-present value of any Federal
Income Tax or State Income Tax benefit to Buyer or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries resulting from any adjustment to or change in any Tax item
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period
ending before or including the Closing Date. Such present value shall be based
on a discount rate of five percent (5%) per annum.

(iii) Seller agrees to make available to Buyer and the Company and its
Subsidiaries records in the custody of Seller or of any member of the Seller
Tax Group, to furnish other information and otherwise to cooperate to the
extent reasonably required for the filing or audit of or other proceeding with
respect to Federal Income Tax Returns and State Income Tax Returns relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending after
the Closing Date. However, no loss, credit or other item of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may be carried back without Sellers written consent,
which Seller may withhold in its absolute discretion, to a taxable period for
which (A) any of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) Seller or any entity
affiliated with Seller filed a consolidated, unitary, combined or similar Tax
Return.



 

-68- (iv) Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer, and Buyer agrees to cooperate (and
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate) with Seller, to the
extent necessary in connection with the filing of any Tax Return relating to
the Buyers acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Payment of Accrued Income Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Seller has the right to receive from the Company and its
Subsidiaries accrued but unpaid Federal Income Taxes and State Income Taxes
for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. If funds for any
such Taxes have not been paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Seller
before Closing, such funds shall be payable (and Buyer shall cause such funds
to be paid) upon Sellers demand to the extent, and only to the extent, such
Taxes are reflected as a liability on the Final Statement of Working Capital.

(g) _Termination of Tax-Sharing Agreement._ After the Closing, this _Section
8.5_ shall supersede any and all Tax-sharing or similar agreements to which
(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (ii) Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are parties. Neither the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Seller nor any such Affiliates shall have any obligation or
right with respect to each other under any such prior agreement after the
Closing.

(h) _Other Tax Returns and Taxes_. The Company and its Subsidiaries (and not
Seller) shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries other than those Tax Returns to which _Sections
8.5(a)_ through _8.5(d)_ apply ("Other Tax Returns"). Except as otherwise
required by Law or expressly agreed in writing by Seller  



 

-69-  and Buyer, (i) each Other Tax Return filed after the Closing Date for any
period ending on or before or including the Closing Date shall be based on
the same accounting methods and Tax elections as used for the same type of
Other Tax Return filed most recently before the Closing Date, and (ii) no
amended Other Tax Return may be filed for a period ending on or before or
including the Closing Date.

(i) _Relationship of Section 8.5 to Sections 8.1 and 8.2_. Any conditions or
limitations set forth in  _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ with respect to the
monetary amount of claims or liability shall not apply to any claim or
liability to which this _Section 8.5_ applies or to any breach of any
obligation under this  _Section 8.5_. In the event of any inconsistency
between provisions of _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ and _Section 8.5_, this
_Section 8.5_ shall control. Seller shall have no liability under this
Agreement for any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries except (i) as
otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 8.5_ with respect to Federal
Income Taxes and State Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(ii) solely with respect to other Taxes, as provided in _Section 8.1_ hereof
for inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty made by Seller in
_Section 3.14_ hereof.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the covenants and
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.5_ shall survive until, and any
claim for indemnification with respect thereto must be made prior to, the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
underlying Tax claim (including any valid extensions).

Section 8.6. _Indemnity Amounts to be Computed on After-Tax Basis_. The amount
of any indemnification payable under any of the provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be (i) net of any Federal Income Tax or State Income Tax benefit
realized or the then-present value (based on a discount rate of five percent
per annum) of any such Income Tax benefit to be realized by the  



 

-70-  indemnified party (or, where Buyer is the indemnified party, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) by reason of the facts and circumstances giving rise to
the indemnification, and (ii) increased by the amount of any Federal Income
Tax or State Income Tax required to be paid by the indemnified party on the
accrual or receipt of the indemnification payment (including any amount
payable pursuant to this clause (ii)). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the amount of any State Income Tax benefit or cost shall take into
account the Federal Income Tax effect of such benefit or cost.

Section 8.7. _Records_. Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
preserve and keep, free of charge, all original books, papers and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing Date
for a period of no less than seven years following the Closing Date. Buyer
agrees to permit Seller and its employees, attorneys, accountants, agents
and designees access to such books, papers and records from and after the
Closing Date for all reasonable purposes. Any such examination shall be at the
expense of Seller, shall be performed at the place where such books, papers
and records are regularly maintained and shall not interfere unreasonably
with Buyers normal business activities. Buyer shall notify Seller at any time
that it intends to destroy any or all of such books, papers and records, and
Seller shall have the right to review and remove at Sellers expense any of
such books, papers and records.

Section 8.8. _No Use of Excluded Intangibles_. Buyer agrees that without
Sellers consent it will not, nor will it permit the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date to, make any use of any of the Excluded
Intangibles including, without limitation, the names "Smithfield Foods,
Inc.," "Smithfield Beef" or the wordmark "Smithfield," or any variation
thereof in any manner; _provided_ , that for up to ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, the  



 

-71-  Company and its Subsidiaries may sell in the ordinary course of business any
inventory bearing any of such marks as of the Effective Time of Closing; and 
_provided further_ , that Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
indemnify and hold Seller harmless for any Losses suffered by Seller that are
directly attributable to such use. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) following the Closing, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall change its corporate name to a name that
does not make use of any of the names, phrases or marks set forth in this
Section, or any names confusingly similar to such names, phrases or marks.

Section 8.9. _Cooperation in Third-Party Proceedings_.

(a) Seller agrees that after the Closing, Seller shall provide such
cooperation as Buyer, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or their counsel
may reasonably request in connection with any proceedings related to the
conduct of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Such
cooperation shall include, without limitation, making employees of Seller
available upon the reasonable request and at the expense of Buyer, the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to consult with and
assist Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their counsel in connection
with any such proceedings and to prepare for and testify in any such
proceedings, including depositions, trials and arbitration proceedings.

(b) Buyer agrees that after the Closing, Buyer shall provide and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation as Seller or its
counsel may reasonably request in connection with any proceedings relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is
a party. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, making employees
of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries available upon the reasonable
request and at the expense of Seller to consult with and assist Seller and
its counsel regarding any such proceedings and to prepare for and testify in
connection with any such proceedings, including depositions, trials and
arbitration proceedings.

  

 

-72- Section 8.10. _Further Assurances_. Seller shall, from time to time after the
Closing, at Buyers and/or the Companys request, execute, acknowledge and
deliver to such requesting Person other instruments of conveyance and transfer
and will take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents,
certifications and further assurances as such requesting Person may
reasonably require in order to vest more effectively in Buyer, or to put Buyer
more fully in possession of, the Stock, or to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate
with the other and execute and deliver to the other party hereto such other
instruments and documents and take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested from time to time by the other party hereto as necessary to carry
out, evidence and confirm the intended purposes of this Agreement.

Section 8.11. _Disclaimer of Implied Warranties_. Except as specifically set
forth in this Agreement, Seller makes no representations or warranties of any
kind or nature, expressed or implied (including, but not limited to, with
respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular or ordinary purpose,
or any relating to the future or historical financial condition, results of
operations, assets or liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries), and any
such other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed, it
being understood that except as expressly set forth herein Buyer is acquiring
the Stock and the Company and its Subsidiaries "as is" and "where is."

Section 8.12. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.

(a) In consideration of the benefits of this Agreement to Seller and in order
to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees that
until the fifth  



 

-73-  anniversary of the Closing Date (such period, the "Non-Competition Period"),
neither Seller nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall engage in the
businesses of cattle feeding or cattle slaughtering within the United States
in competition with any of the businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
as conducted as of the Closing Date without the express written consent of
Buyer,  _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section shall not be construed to
apply to: (i) Sellers ownership of less than an aggregate of 5% of any class
of capital stock of any entity that is traded on a national securities
exchange or inter-dealer quotation system; (ii) any non-affiliated person or
entity that acquires Seller or substantially all of the assets of Seller in an
arms-length transaction; (iii) any person or entity that acquires any
subsidiary or discrete business operation of Seller (other than Seller or any
of its controlled Affiliates); (iv) businesses acquired by Seller, so long as
business activities that would otherwise be prohibited by this Section
represent 30% or less of the acquired business revenues for the duration of
the Non-Competition Period; (v) the solicitation by Seller or its Affiliates
of customers of the Company, Buyer or Buyers Affiliates with regard to
products and services other than those of the type referred to in this
Section; and (vi) the matters set forth on _Exhibit 8.12_ attached hereto.

(b) The parties intend that the covenant contained in this _Section 8.12_
shall be deemed a series of separate covenants for each appropriate
jurisdiction and for each year of the Non-Competition Period. If, in any
judicial proceeding, a court of competent jurisdiction shall refuse to
enforce all the separate covenants deemed included in this _Section 8.12_ on
grounds that, taken together, they cover too extensive a geographic area or
extend for too long of a period of time, the parties intend that those
covenants (taken in order of the least populous jurisdictions with respect to
geography) that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate covenants
to be enforced in that proceeding, shall, for the purpose of such proceeding,
be deemed eliminated from the provisions of this _Section 8.12_.



 

-74- (c) Seller covenants and agrees that during the Non-Competition Period it
shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, solicit, induce
or attempt to persuade any employee or agent of the Company, Buyer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to terminate his or her employment or agency
relationship; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from
placing a general advertisement or from employing individuals who respond to
any such advertisement whether or not such individuals are then employed by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or from employing any individual who
contacts Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates on an unsolicited basis.

Section 8.13. _Release of Seller Guarantees_. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at or prior to the Closing Date, at its own cost
and expense the full release of Seller and all of its Affiliates as
guarantors of the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
guarantees set forth on _Exhibit 8.13_ attached hereto. If any such releases
are not obtained at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall continue to use
its commercially reasonable efforts from and after the Effective Time of
Closing to obtain, at its own cost and expense, the full release of Seller and
all of its Affiliates as guarantors of the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the guarantees set forth on _Exhibit 8.13_ attached
hereto, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any and all
Losses Seller may incur from and after the Effective Time pursuant to any such
guarantees.

Agreement), (ii) deliver to Seller such Five Rivers Closing Date Balance
Sheet simultaneously with the delivery by Buyer to Seller of the draft Final
Statement of Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ hereof, (iii)
provide reasonable access (during normal business hours) to Seller and Conti
and their respective advisors to all books and records, relevant personnel,
consultants and advisors (including independent auditors) of Five Rivers LLC
or Buyer reasonably necessary for Seller and Conti to review and verify the
accuracy of the draft  



 

-76-  Five Rivers Closing Date Balance Sheet and (iv) reasonably cooperate with
any accounting firm selected pursuant to the Five Rivers Purchase Agreement
to resolve any dispute relating to the Five Rivers Closing Date Balance Sheet
or the determination of the Closing Company Working Capital or Closing Company

rendering facility to the extent necessary for such facility to be capable of
conducting its operations, in all material respects, as they were conducted
