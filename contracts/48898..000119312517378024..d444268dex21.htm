the Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Valuation Firm&#146;s determination of the Closing
Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Representative (<I>i.e.</I>, not on independent review) and on the definitions included herein. Absent manifest

borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Members and Optionholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if the Purchaser claims the Closing Cash Proceeds are one thousand dollars&nbsp;($1,000) less than the amount determined by the Representative, and the Representative contests only five hundred
dollars&nbsp;($500) of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Purchaser three hundred dollars&nbsp;($300) of the five hundred dollars&nbsp;($500) contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (<I>i.e.</I>, 300 &divide; 500) to the Representative (on behalf of the Members and Optionholders) and forty percent (40%) (<I>i.e.</I>, 200 &divide; 500) to the Purchaser. Prior
