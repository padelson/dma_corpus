Corporation.

  


 

  

3.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, at its sole expense, shall appoint
Computershare Trust Company N.A. or such other exchange agent as mutually
agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent (the "Exchange Agent") to act
as the agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i)
the Certificates, or (ii) Book-Entry Shares. At the Closing, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Common Shares, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Common Shares
represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (the "Payment
Fund"). The Payment Fund shall be invested for the benefit of the holders of
Common Shares by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however,
that: (A) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Common Shares represented by the
Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares; and (B) such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). If the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the Merger
Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Common Shares
represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares due to any loss in
the Payment Fund or otherwise, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable
or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly (and in any case, within five (5)
Business Days) to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent
sufficient to make all remaining payments required to be made pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ hereof, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any
event be liable for the payment thereof. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by Parent. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with the exchange of Common Shares for
the Merger Consideration. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to pay the Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all
of the Common Shares represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry
Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any case, within five (5)
Business Days), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to each record holder of Common Shares at the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal in a customary form to be mutually agreed to by the Company and
Parent (the "Letter of Transmittal") and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

    

(b) Each holder of Common Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Per Share
Consideration allocable to such holder in respect of each Common Share held by
such holder and represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-
Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and
subject to the terms set forth in _Section 3.3_ , each such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive the allocable Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof or the right to demand to be paid the "fair market
value" of the Common Shares represented thereby as contemplated by _Section
3.3_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  


 

  

(c) If any of the Per Share Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  


 

  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

  


 

  

(e) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Common Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this _Article III_.

  


 

  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

  


 

  

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders
of Common Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Common
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon but subject to any applicable
withholdings. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
exchanged prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which the related Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

    

(h) None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any holder of Common Shares for any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to
a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Law.

  


 

  

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

  


 

  

3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, including _Section 3.1_ , Common Shares which were outstanding
on the date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the
Merger (other than Common Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_
), which were not voted in favor of the Merger, and the holders of which (i)
have demanded that the Company purchase such Common Shares at their fair
market value in accordance with Section 1301 of CGCL (ii) have submitted such
Common Shares for endorsement in accordance with Section 1302 of CGCL and
(iii) have not otherwise failed to perfect or shall not have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to be entitled to require the corporation to
purchase their shares under CGCL (such Common Shares being referred to
collectively as the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration allocable to such Dissenting Shares, but
instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 1300
et. seq. of the CGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder\'s right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 1300 et. seq. of the CGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 1300 et. seq. of the CGCL, such Common Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration allocable thereto in accordance with
_Section 3.1(b)_ , without interest thereon but subject to any applicable
withholdings, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such
Common Share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be. The
Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of Common Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the CGCL that relates to such demand; provided, however, that
commencing ten (10) Business Days prior to the Shareholders Meeting, the
Company shall provide Parent with the aforementioned written notice within two
(2) days of receipt by the Company of any such demand (or demand withdrawal),
notice or instrument and in any event the Company shall provide to Parent all
such demands, withdrawals, notices and/or instruments that it is in receipt of
on the day prior to the Shareholders Meeting and for which notice has not
already been provided to Parent, to Parent on the day prior to the
Shareholders Meeting and shall provide notice of any such demand, withdrawal,
notice or instrument received on the day of the Shareholders Meeting to Parent
immediately following receipt. Parent shall have the opportunity and right to
direct all negotiations, petitions and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which may be given or withheld in Parent\'s sole
discretion), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

    

3.4 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if, at any time during the period between the Agreement Date and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of
the Company as expressly permitted by this Agreement) by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Per Share Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock and to provide to
the holders of Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; provided, however, that nothing in this
_Section 3.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this _Article III_ such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any
applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

  


 

  

3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the allocable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this _Article III_ , without any interest thereon but
subject to any applicable withholdings.

  


 

  

3.7 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock,
restricted shares of Company Common Stock, and restricted stock units set
forth on _Section 3.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule then outstanding
and unvested and/or not exercisable (irrespective of any time- or performance-
based condition or other contingency) (each, an "Unvested Equity Award"),
shall become fully vested and exercisable. At the Effective Time, each Equity
Award not previously exercised shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, cancelled and converted into
solely the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any case,
within five (5) Business Days), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration over any
applicable exercise price per share of such Equity Award, and (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Equity Award is exercisable,
without interest and subject to applicable withholdings, including for income
and employment Taxes (with the aggregate amount rounded down to the nearest
whole cent); provided that if the exercise price per share of any such Equity
Award is equal to or greater than the Per Share Consideration, then such
Equity Award shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

  

    

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
Company\'s Compensation Committee shall adopt such resolutions and take such
other actions, which may, to the extent required under the terms of the
applicable Equity Awards, include obtaining consents of employees, officers,
directors and any other holders of Equity Awards, as may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of _Section 3.7(a)_. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to cancel and terminate the Company Stock Plans and Company
LTIP Plans effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time (it
being understood and agreed that no further awards or other rights with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall be granted thereunder
following such termination).

  


 

  

3.8 _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock ("Warrant"), shall by virtue of the Merger be terminated
and shall be converted solely into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any case, within five (5) Business Days), an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Consideration over the then effective exercise price per share under
the Warrant, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
the Warrant is then exercisable, provided that if the then exercise price per
share under the Warrant is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Consideration, then any such Warrant shall be canceled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  


 

  

Except as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of the Company

any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, subscription right
or any similar right under any Applicable Law, the Company Charter, Company

4.3 _Power, Authority and Consents_.

  


 

  

(a) _Power and Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into, execute, deliver and to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and, subject to, in the case of the consummation of the Merger,
adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote (as defined below)
and the filing of the Certificate of Merger, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company and no other shareholder votes are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, subject only, in the
case of consummation of the Merger, to the receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote (and the filing of the Certificate of Merger and any other merger
documents required by the CGCL and the filing of certain documents with the
SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market in order to delist and deregister the Company
Common Stock). The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a
majority of the Common Shares outstanding on the record date of the
Shareholders Meeting, voting together as a single class, to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger (the "Requisite Company Vote") is the only
vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s
capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Applicable Laws related to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Laws
affecting creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

  

    

(b) _No Consents_. Subject to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, no
consent, approval, waiver, order or authorization of, or registration, notice,
declaration, or filing with (any of the foregoing being a "Consent") (i) any
Governmental Authority; or (ii) any other Person is necessary or required to
be made or obtained by the Company to enable the Company to lawfully execute
and deliver, enter into, and perform its obligations under this Agreement or
to consummate the Merger, except for (v) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of California, (w) the filing of the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC in
accordance with the Exchange Act, and such other documents under the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act as may be required in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (x) such Consents as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act")(y) such
Consents as may be required under applicable state securities or "blue sky"
laws and the securities laws of any foreign country or the rules and
regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market, and (z), such other Consents the
failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(c) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and
held at which a majority of the directors of the Company were present, acting
on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee duly adopted
resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company\'s stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company for adoption and approval and (iv) resolving to
recommend that the Company Shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified
or withdrawn in any way, except as may be permitted by _Section 6.5_.

  


 

  

4.4 _No Conflict_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict with, or (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) result in or give rise to a right of a
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
the loss of a material benefit under, breach, impairment or violation of,
constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance in or
upon any of the properties, assets or rights of the Company under, or give
rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitled under, or require any Consent of any Person pursuant to: (a) any
provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws (or similar organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of the Company), each as currently in effect, (b)
subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in _Section
4.3_ any Applicable Law or any rule or regulation of The NASDAQ Stock Market
applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries any of their respective
material assets or properties; or (c) any Company Material Contract.

under the Financing Commitments, and, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ _s_ _8.1_ and _8.2_ , as of the Agreement

commit to or agree (or permit its Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any
Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

    

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section
6.4(a)_ hereof, the Company shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Authorities with

respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information
or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the

Governmental Authority or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

  


 

  

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, the Company shall reasonably cooperate in all
respects with Parent and Merger Sub and shall contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned

or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (v)
make or authorize any statement, propose or resolve, propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

    

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(a)_ , nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) contacting a Person
who has made, or proposes to make an Acquisition Proposal and to whom the
Company is permitted to provide non-public information pursuant to _Section
6.5(c)_ solely to request clarifications of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) complying with its disclosure obligations under
Exchange Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Exchange Act Rule 14d-9(f)) shall be deemed to be a Change in Board
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Board Recommendation in
such disclosure.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provisions of Section 6.5(a) to the contrary, nothing

Company containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
the Company than those set forth in the NDA taken as a whole (provided, that
such confidentiality agreement need not include a standstill provision), and
(ii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company Board, which demonstrates
the financial capability of such Person to consummate the Acquisition
Proposal; provided, further that prior to taking any action described in
clause (x) above or clause (y) below, (A) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) above or clause (y)
below, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Company Shareholders under Applicable Law, (B) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, based on the information
then available and upon the recommendation of the Special Committee (after
consultation with the Special Committee\'s independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (C) such Acquisition Proposal is bona fide, written and not a
result of a breach or violation of this Section 6.5, or (y) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with the Person making an Acquisition Proposal
described in and satisfying the requirements of clause (x) regarding such

two (2) Business Days after receipt by the Company) advise Parent in writing
of any inquiry or proposal or offer related to an Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
other than requests that are not reasonably expected to be related to an
Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Acquisition Proposal or request, and the terms thereof) that
is made or submitted by any Person prior to the Effective Time.

  

    

(d) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.5(e)_ , neither the Company

qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval of this Agreement and the

Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve, endorse, recommend, or otherwise declare

declare advisable, publicly or otherwise, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail
to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days

Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of any such Acquisition
Proposal, (vi) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Company Proxy
Statement, (vii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle or similar document or Contract constituting or relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in
accordance with, and meeting the requirements of, _Section 6.5(c)_ ), (viii)
make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation, or (ix) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions
(any action described in clauses (i) through (ix), and the action expressly
referred to in _Section 6.5(b)_ , a "Change in Board Recommendation").

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Company Shareholders under Applicable Law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ (x) the Company Board may effect a
Change in Board Recommendation in response to either (1) a Superior Proposal
or (2) an Intervening Event or (y) solely if the Company has received an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is not
withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal and did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section
6.5_ , terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ and concurrently
enter into a binding definitive acquisition agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal;

  

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may take the action set forth in
the preceding clause (y) or make a Change in Board Recommendation in response
to a Superior Proposal if and only if:

  


 

  

(i) the Company shall have complied with each of its obligations under this
_Section 6.5_ relating to such Change in Board Recommendation, or resulting in
the Acquisition Proposal that led to such Superior Proposal;

  


 

  

(ii) (A) the Company shall have provided written notice to Parent at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), to the effect that
the Company Board has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board has concluded in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.5(e)_ , which notice
shall specify the basis and reasons for such resolution, including the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal and
the terms and conditions thereof, and shall have contemporaneously furnished
to Parent a copy of the proposed definitive acquisition agreement and any
other relevant transaction documentation; (B) prior to effecting such
termination of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent requested by Parent) regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent, and (2) if Parent makes a proposal during the Notice
Period, at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by Parent, still determines in good faith, upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee (after consultation with outside legal counsel and the
Special Committee\'s financial advisor), that the Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to terminate this Agreement would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company
Shareholders under Applicable Law; provided that, in the event of any
revisions to the financial terms or any other material terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.5_ (including
this _Section 6.5(e)_ ) with respect to such new written notice, and there
shall be a new Notice Period; and

  


 

  

(iii) in the case of any action as contemplated by clause (y) of this
_Section 6.5(e)_ above, the Company shall have validly terminated this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.3(b)_ , including the payment of the
Termination Fee (as defined below) to Parent in accordance with _Section
9.6(a)_ ;

  


 

  

provided, further, that the Company Board may not effect a Change in Board
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event unless:

  


 

  

(i) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable after
becoming aware of it;

  

    

(ii) the Company keeps Parent reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Events;

  


 

  

(iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days
before making such a Change in Board Recommendation with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor;

  


 

  

(iv) if Parent makes a proposal during such five (5) Business Day period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such Change in
Board Recommendation would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Company Shareholders under Applicable Law; and

  


 

  

(v) during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent requested by Parent) regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as proposed by Parent.

  


 

  

(f) The Company agrees that it shall (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing investigation, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement (but in any event on the day
after the Agreement Date) the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) deliver as promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement (but in any event on the day after the
Agreement Date) a written notice to each such Person to the effect that the
Company is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, effective on the Agreement Date.

  


 

  

(g) Subject to the terms of any applicable confidentiality agreement, the
Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days of receipt) notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any indication by any Person that it is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or the Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not
reasonably expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) any
inquiry, offer or request for discussions or negotiations regarding an
Acquisition Proposal or that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case including, with such notice, the identity of the Person
or group of Persons making such proposal, offer, request, indication or
inquiry, a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by
such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers,
and thereafter shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed of the
status, details and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations
(including of any amendment, modification, development, discussion or
negotiation), including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly notify Parent orally and in writing if
it determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal permitted pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ and shall in no event begin providing such information or
engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

  

    

(h) The Company will not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any
provision of any existing confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, will enforce the terms
thereof, and will not permit any counterparty to any such Contract to deviate
from compliance with the terms thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party contains a provision that prohibits the
counterparty to such agreement from requesting a waiver to a standstill, the
Company shall be permitted to waive its rights with respect to such
prohibition. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any breach of any
existing confidentiality agreement by the counterparty thereto.

  


 

  

6.6 _Preparation of Company Proxy Statement; Approv_ _al of Company
Shareholders_.

  


 

  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the Company Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company Shareholders, the
Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company Charter and
the Company Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
the Company Shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement
(the "Shareholders Meeting"); provided, however, that in no event shall such
meeting be held later than 75 calendar days following the date on which the
Company Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing, and any
adjournments or postponements of the Shareholders Meeting shall require the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) other than in the case the Company is required to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which is required by court order or under
Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company Shareholders prior to the
Shareholders Meeting. Except in the case of a Change in Board Recommendation
specifically permitted by _Section 6.5(e)_ , the Company, through the Company
Board, shall (i) solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the CGCL, (ii)
recommend to the Company Shareholders that they adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) include such recommendation in the
Company Proxy Statement.

  


 

  

(b) In connection with the Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date, (i) prepare and file

preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act and (ii) in consultation with
Parent, set a record date for the Shareholders Meeting and commence a broker
search pursuant to Section 14a‑13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith.
Once the Company has established a record date for the Shareholders Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
required to do so by Applicable Law or the Company Bylaws. The Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to have the Company Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof. The Company shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement and shall cause the Company Proxy
Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Company Shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Company Proxy Statement is
cleared by the SEC. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable
of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the
Company Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto, or
requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith, and shall provide to Parent copies of any written comments received
from the SEC or its staff. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Company\'s
proposed responses to any comments to the Company Proxy Statement from the SEC
or its Staff prior to the Company responding to any such comments and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. Parent shall
cooperate fully with the Company in the preparation of the Company Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto and shall furnish the
Company, promptly upon the Company\'s request, all information relating to
Parent and Merger Sub reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in, or
otherwise in respect of, the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Company Proxy Statement (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) and all other materials used in connection with the Merger
that (i) constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as those
terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those
terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each
case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and the mailing/dissemination
thereof to the Company Shareholders, and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel.

  

    

(c) If, at any time prior to the Requisite Company Vote, any information
relating to the Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Company Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party hereto which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly
file an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement
and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the Company Shareholders.

  


 

  

(d) Subject only to a Change in Board Recommendation in compliance with
_Section 6.5(d)_ , the Board Recommendation shall be included in the Company
Proxy Statement.

  


 

  

6.7 _Litigation_. The Company shall notify Parent in writing promptly but in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days after learning of any material
Action or mediation by or before any court, arbitrator or arbitration panel,
board or governmental agency, initiated by or against it, or known by the
Company to be threatened against the Company or any of its officers or
directors in their capacity as such.

  

    

6.8 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives access during regular business hours, so long as 24 hour
advance notice is provided, to all of their respective files, books, records,
Contracts, personnel, properties, assets and offices of the Company, including
without limitation any and all information relating to the Company\'s taxes,
Contracts, Liabilities, financial condition and real, personal and intangible
property (which such access shall expressly exclude the right for Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives to conduct environmental
testing of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' properties), and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
Parent: (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may
reasonably request (including Tax Returns filed and those in preparation and
the workpapers of its auditors). All such information shall be held subject to
the terms of the NDA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company in its sole
discretion may restrict Parent\'s access to (i) documents that are attorney-
client privileged or confidential, or (ii) documents that relate to the
Company Board\'s consideration of this Agreement or alternatives thereto. No
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ or information provided, made
available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

  


 

  

6.9 _Company Cooperation with Debt Financing Efforts_. From the Agreement Date
through the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and its and their respective
Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to, provide to Parent such
cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing (provided that such requested
cooperation is consistent with Applicable Law and does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
including providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of customary
disclosure documents and customary representation letters reasonably required
in connection with the Debt Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and its Subsidiary\'s names, logos and trademarks solely in connection
with the Debt Financing. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries shall be
required, under the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ or otherwise in
connection with the Debt Financing, (x) to pay any commitment or other similar
fee prior to the Closing Date that is not advanced or substantially
simultaneously reimbursed by Parent or (y) to incur any out of pocket cost or
expense unless such expense is reimbursed by Parent on the earlier of the
Closing Date or termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_.
Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing or to authorize or approve the Debt Financing prior to the Closing.
All material, non-public information regarding the Company and the
Subsidiaries provided to Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 6.9_ shall be kept confidential by them in accordance with the NDA
except for disclosure to potential lenders and investors as required in
connection with the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality
protections.

  


 

  

6.10 _Discharge of Company Funded Indebtedness and Release of Encumbrances_.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain from each lender or holder
of Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 4.5(d) a letter, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (i) specifying the amount of such
indebtedness owed to such lender or holder, and (ii) agreeing that, upon such
lender\'s or holder\'s receipt of the applicable payoff amount, (A) all
outstanding obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising under or
related to the applicable indebtedness shall be repaid and discharged in full
and (B) any Encumbrance\'s such lender or holder may have in connection
therewith shall be released (collectively, the "Payoff Letters").

  

    

6.11 _Satisfaction of Condition`s Precedent_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the
conditions precedent set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect
to such shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

6.13 _Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each
member of the Company Board to execute a letter effectuating his or her
resignation as a director of the Company Board effective immediately prior to

6.14 _Public Announcements_. The Company shall consult with Parent before
issuing, and give Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon,
any employee communication, press release or other public statements with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such communication, press release or make any

and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (C)
providing the Company with copies of any formal or informal request for
supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and make, or
cause to be made, as promptly as practicable, a response in compliance with
such request; provided that Parent shall provide the Company and its
Representatives with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
response. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall commit to or agree (or permit
their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any Governmental
Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)_ hereof, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) provide or cause to be
provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Authorities
with jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws information and documents requested
by any such Governmental Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act and any additional Consents under any other
Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the Agreement
Date(provided that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such filing
shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the Agreement Date) and
thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional
information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to
take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Authority or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

  

    

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all
respects with the Company and shall contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that could
prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 7.2_ will require, or be construed to require,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to agree or proffer
to (i) sell, hold separate, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the
Effective Time, any assets, businesses or interest in any assets or businesses
of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or assuming the consummation of the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates, (ii) limit in any
manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities
(including the Common Shares), or (iii) enter into any agreement that in any
way limits the ownership or operation of any business of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

  


 

  

7.3 _Parent Financing_.

  


 

  

(a) _Debt Financing_. Parent shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing
(including by consummating the Equity Financing at or prior to Closing), (iii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Financing Commitments or consistent in all material
respects with the Debt Financing Commitments, or on other terms that would not
materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) draw down on the Debt Financing if
the conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing have been satisfied
or waived. Parent shall not, and shall cause Merger Sub to not, agree to or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive agreements
related to the Debt Financing, if such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, or (B)
impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in the case of either clause
(A) or (B) above in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1)
materially delay or prevent the Closing Date, (2) make the funding of the Debt
Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) materially less likely to occur or (C) materially adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Closing or the likelihood of consummation of the Closing, in each case,
without the Company\'s prior written consent; provided, however, that Parent
and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Financing Commitments or any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents, other funding sources, additional equity
financiers or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the Agreement Date. Upon any such amendment, supplement or
modification of the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with this
_Section 7.3(a)_ , Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and the
term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments as
so amended, supplemented or modified. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
apprised of developments relating to the Debt Financing and will provide
prompt notice of any material breach or default by any party to the Debt
Financing Commitment of which Parent becomes aware or any written
communication from any Person with respect to any actual or purported material
breach, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing
Commitment.

  

    

(b) _Substitute Financing_. As an alternative to the Debt Financing, Parent
and Merger Sub may obtain substitute financing consistent with the section in
the Debt Financing Commitments entitled "Alternative Financing Structure" (the
"Substitute Financing") so long as the replacement of the Debt Financing
Commitments with commitments for the Substitute Financing (the "Substitute
Financing Commitments") would not be adverse in any material respect to the
Company, taking the Debt Financing Commitments and the Substitute Financing
Commitments as a whole. In the event the Debt Financing is so replaced, the
term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean the Substitute Financing
Commitments and the term "Debt Financing" shall mean the "Substitute
Financing".

  


 

  

(c) _Alternative Financing_. In the event all or any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments for any reason, Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing (the
"Alternative Financing") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
extent the Debt Financing is so replaced, the term "Debt Financing
Commitments" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments, if any, and the
commitments for the Alternative Financing, together, and the term "Debt
Financing" shall mean the Debt Financing, if any, and the Alternative
Financing, in the aggregate.

  


 

  

7.4 _Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers_.

  


 

  

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its current and former
directors and officers (the "Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any
indemnification provisions under the Company\'s Charter, Company Bylaws and
any indemnification agreement which has been provided to Parent between the
Company and such Company Indemnified Parties, as in effect on the Agreement
Date (the "Company Indemnification Provisions"), with respect to claims
arising out of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time. Any
claims for indemnification made under this _Section 7.4(a)_ on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such anniversary until
the final resolution thereof.

  

    

(b) This _Section 7.4_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and,
notwithstanding _Section 10.12_ shall be enforceable by the Company
Indemnified Parties.

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance coverage for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time for the Company\'s current directors and officers for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than the Company\'s existing policies
as of the Agreement Date and provided further, that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section 7.4(c)_
in excess of 200% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by the Company for
fiscal year 2013 for such purpose (which fiscal year 2013 premiums are hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to be as set forth in _Section
7.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), it being understood that Parent
shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained
for such 200% amount.

  


 

  

7.5 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  


 

  

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date
which is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (or if earlier, the date
of the employee\'s termination of employment with Parent and its
Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Company Continuing Employees") with base salary and target
cash bonus opportunities (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, equity-based
compensation) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the base salary
and target cash bonus opportunities provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Agreement Date. The employees covered by this provision
will remain at-will employees in all respects. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall confer upon any employee any right with respect to continued
employment by Parent or Surviving Corporation, nor shall anything herein
interfere with the right of Parent or Surviving Corporation to terminate the
employment of any employee (including any Company Continuing Employee) at any
time, with or without cause, following the effective date of his or her
employment with Parent or Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any Company
Continuing Employees are or may become eligible to participate in on or
following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the extent permitted by
the terms of the applicable employee benefit plans, programs, policies, or
arrangements, recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as if such service
were with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit levels based on seniority; provided, that,
such service shall not be recognized (i) for benefit accrual purposes under
any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan, or (ii) to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

  

    

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Company Continuing Employee or other employee of the
Company, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof, with respect to any right
of employment (including, without limitation, the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and benefits) or any other legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall amend, or be deemed to amend, any benefit plan of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any Benefit Plan, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to, or does, constitute the establishment of,
or an amendment to, any benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

7.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent shall consult with Company before issuing,
and give the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
employee communication, press release or other public statements with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and shall not issue any such communication, press release or make any public
announcement without the prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by Applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. For the avoidance
of doubt, this Section shall not restrict Parent\'s disclosure of information
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, including any information
related to Parent\'s determination to enter into this Agreement, to investors
or prospective investors in Parent so long as such disclosures are made
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms.

previously paid to Parent (if any) pursuant to _Section 9.6(b)_ , it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion; _provided_ , that the payment by
the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ shall not
relieve the Company from any liability or damage resulting from a willful and
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud. Payment of the Termination
Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account designated

termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ , or (iii) at the time
required by Section 9.3(b), in the case of a termination by the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ under
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to
_Section 9.6(a)_ , then the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates
for all of their reasonable out of pocket fees and expenses (including all
fees and expenses of Financing Sources, counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, experts and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub and their
Affiliates) incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection
with or related to the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Parent Expenses"), up to a maximum amount of $7.5 million;
_provided_ , that the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant
to this _Section 9.6(d)_ , (i) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.6(a)_ except to
the extent indicated in such Section, and (ii) shall not relieve the Company
from any liability or damage resulting from a willful and material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or fraud. Payment of the Parent Expenses shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to the account designated by Parent promptly (and,
in any event, within fifteen (15) Business Days) after the Company has been
notified of the amounts thereof by Parent.

  

    

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.3(c)_ , Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee equal to
$19.0 million (the "Reverse Termination Fee") promptly (and, in any event,
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of such termination).

  


 

  

9.7 _Acknowledgement_. Each Party acknowledges that (a) the agreements
contained in this _Article IX_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) without the agreements contained in
this _Article IX_ , neither Parent nor the Company would have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 9.6_ or and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company, Parent and/or Merger Sub commences
a suit that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, for the amount set forth in _Section 9.6_ or any portion thereof, the
prevailing party in such suit shall pay to the other party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) incurred by it
and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on
such amount or portion thereof until the date of payment at the prime lending
rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

  


 

  

9.8 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement:

  


 

  

(a) No Parent Party, except Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors (but only
to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty), shall have any liability for
any obligation or liability to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of
its or their direct or indirect shareholders for any claim for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or
the Financing Commitments (including any willful and material breach), or the
failure of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby
to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to
be have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise;

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the right of the Company to seek specific performance in
accordance with _Section 10.8_ , the maximum aggregate liability of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Guarantors for any loss suffered as a result of any breach
of this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the Financing Commitments
(including any willful and material breach), or the failure of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, shall be limited to the amount of the Reverse Termination
Fee (inclusive of the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee), and in no event
shall the Company seek to, and the Company shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their direct and indirect shareholders not to seek to, recover any money
damages (including consequential, indirect or punitive damages) in excess of
such amount; and

  

    

(c) Without in any way limiting the generality of _Section 9.8(a)_ , upon
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, no Parent Party shall have any further
liability or obligation to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its or
their direct or indirect stockholders relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the Financing Commitments, or the failure
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby to be
consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and in such event, the Company shall
not seek to, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their direct and
indirect stockholders not to seek to, recover any money damages (including
consequential, indirect or punitive damages, or damages on account of a
willful and material breach) or obtain any equitable relief from any Parent
Party.

MISCELLANEOUS

  


 

  

10.1 _Survival_. None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this Agreement will survive the
Effective Time. None of the covenants or agreements of the parties in this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, other than those covenants and
agreements contained herein which by their terms apply, or that are to be
performed in whole or in part, after the Effective Date, which shall survive
the consummation of the Merger until fully performed.

  


 

  

10.2 _Governing Law_. The internal laws of the State of California,
irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the validity of
this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto.

  


 

  

10.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Limitation on Suits Against Financing
Sources_. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably submits itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any court of proper subject matter jurisdiction in
the State of California in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement
or the Merger, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this
Agreement or the Merger in any court other than a court in the State of
California, other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court. Each of the
parties hereto further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and waives any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action related to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Merger, that (i) the Action in any such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii)
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary and
without limiting the generality of _Section 9.8(a)_ , each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Action of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation any dispute arising out of or relating to the Equity Commitment,
Debt Financing Commitment, the Alternative Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or any New York State Court sitting in New York
City, and that the provisions of _Section 10.4_ relating to the waiver of jury
trial shall apply to any such Action.

  

    

10.4 _Waiver of Jury Trial_ _._ EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  


 

  

10.5 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including any
successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no party
hereto may assign or delegate, in whole or in part, any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

  


 

  

10.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable
under any Applicable Law or jurisdiction, then (a) such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and the (b) remainder of this Agreement and
the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of the void or
unenforceable provision.

  


 

  

10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of original,
facsimile or .PDF counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards
any party whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding
when one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall
bear the signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.

  


 

  

10.8 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to _Section 9.8_ , if any party should breach its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement, the parties each acknowledge that it would be
extremely impracticable to measure the resulting damages; accordingly, the
parties agree that, in addition to any other available rights or remedies they
may have under this Agreement, (i) Parent may sue in equity for specific
performance and/or to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such parties in any
court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in connection therewith and (ii) the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance only to the extent described in _Section
10.8(b)_ and _(c)_.

  

    

(b) Subject to _Section 9.8_ , the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to draw down the Equity Financing
or to consummate the Merger only if:

  


 

  

(i) all conditions in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied;

  


 

  

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_ ;

  


 

  

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; and

  


 

  

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur.

  


 

  

(c) Subject to _Section 9.8_ , prior to any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.3_ , the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of the obligation of Parent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement to draw down on the Debt Financing if the conditions to the
availability of the Debt Financing have been satisfied or waived, but only in
the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:

  


 

  

(i) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ have been and
continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing);

  


 

  

(ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required
to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_ ;

  


 

  

(iii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
provided by the Debt Financing Commitments (or, if Alternative Financing is
being used, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing); and

  


 

  

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that the
Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or
Alternative Financing) are funded, and Parent otherwise complies with its
obligations hereunder, then the Closing will occur; provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent be obligated to bring any Action against any of the
other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment for breach of such party\'s
obligations under any Debt Financing Commitment or definitive financing
agreement in order to enforce such party\'s obligation.

  

    

10.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified or supplemented, and the observance of any term of this
Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and
either retroactively or prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party
to be bound thereby. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in
the performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto as provided in this _Section 10.9_ at any time before or
after adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote, but, after
such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Applicable Law requires the
further approval of the Company Shareholders without obtaining such further
approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Sections
9.5_ , _9.8_ , _10.1_ , _10.3_ , _10.4_ , _10.14(a)_ and this _Section 10.9_
(and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of _Section 9.5_ ,
_9.8_ , _10.1_ , _10.3_ , _10.4_ , _10.14(a)_ and this _Section 10.9_ ) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse
in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of
the Financing Sources. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
Company and Parent, may, to the extent authorized by their respective Board of
Directors and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to it
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained
herein; provided, however, that after the Requisite Company Vote has been
obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to Applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval or adoption. No such waiver or extension shall be effective
unless signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is
asserted. The failure or delay of any party to enforce any of the provisions
hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party
thereafter to enforce such provisions, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

  


 

  

10.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.6_ , each party
shall bear its respective legal, accountants, and financial advisory fees and
other expenses incurred with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the Merger is consummated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Parent and the Company shall share equally
all filing fees required in connection with filings made under the HSR Act,
and (b) in the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by
the Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ , or Parent pursuant to _9.4(a)_ or
_9.4(b)_ , Parent shall reimburse the Company for half of the aggregate fees
(other than attorneys\' fees) and expenses incurred in connection with filing
the Company Proxy Statement and calling the Shareholders Meeting.

  


 

  

10.11 _Attorneys\' Fees_. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any
part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as
an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys\'
fees to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any
appeal). The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit,
regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.

  

    

10.12 _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile or email, sent by certified or registered first-
class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier
service. Such notices and other communications shall be deemed duly given (a)
upon receipt, if hand delivered, (b) upon written confirmation of receipt by
facsimile or email, if delivered by facsimile or email, (c) three (3) Business
Days after mailing if sent by mail, and (d) one (1) Business Day after

10.13 _Interpretation; Rules of Construction_. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to Exhibits, Sections or Articles, such reference shall be to
an Exhibit to, Section of or Article of this Agreement, respectively, unless
otherwise indicated. The words "include", "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to the Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision in this Agreement. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect as the word "shall." References to days mean calendar days unless
otherwise specified. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement. All words used in this Agreement will be construed
to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require. The headings and
table of contents contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit or Schedule
hereto are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules
annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a
part of this Agreement as if set forth herein. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by legal counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

  


 

  

10.14 _Third Party Beneficiary Rights_.

  


 

  

(a) Except as expressly provided herein, no provisions of this Agreement are
intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,
employee, Affiliate, shareholder, partner or any party hereto or any other
Person unless specifically provided otherwise herein and, except as so
provided, all provisions hereof shall be personal solely between the parties
to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the provisions of
_Section 9.8(a)_ and _9.8(c)_ shall be enforceable against the Company (but
not Parent or Merger Sub) by each Financing Source and its successors and
assigns, (ii) each Parent Party shall be a third party beneficiary of Sections
_9.8(a)_ , _9.8(c)_ and _10.9_ , (iii) the provisions of this _Section 10.14_
, the last sentence of _Section 10.3_ and _Section 10.4_ shall be enforceable
against all parties to this Agreement by each Financing Source and its
successors and assigns and no amendment or modification to such provisions
including without limitation this _Section10.14_ in any respect relating to
any Financing Source may be made without the prior consent of such provider of
such Financing Source and (iv) the Guarantors shall be a third party
beneficiary of Section 9.8(b).

  


 

  

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 10.9_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the Agreement Date or as of any other date.

  

    

10.15 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules hereto,
the NDA, and the Limited Guaranty constitute the entire understanding and
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings,
inducements or conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the
parties with respect hereto other than the NDA, which Parent and the Company
agree shall continue to be in full force and effect following the execution of
this Agreement; provided, however, the parties agree that no provision of the
NDA shall limit in any respect the rights of Parent, the Guarantors or any of
their Affiliates to assign or syndicate any portion of their Equity Financing,
subject to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitment Letter. In the event
of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the NDA,
the terms of this Agreement shall control. The express terms hereof control
and supersede any course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent
with any of the terms hereof.
