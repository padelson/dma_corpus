Sheet and the determination of Net Asset Value reflected on the Proposed Final

Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement. Any Dispute Notice must set

Amount, Closing Cash Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses or Net Asset
Value, as the case may be. Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised
in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties on
such thirtieth (30th) Business Day.

(e) _Resolution of Disputes_. Buyer and Seller will attempt to
promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice in good faith.
Beginning ten (10) Business Days after delivery of any Dispute Notice
pursuant to _Section 2.05(d)_, either Buyer or Seller may provide written
notice to the other (the " _Dispute Submission Notice_ ") that it elects to
submit the disputed items to Duff and Phelps Corporation or another nationally
recognized independent accounting firm chosen jointly by Buyer and Seller
(the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event that Duff and Phelps Corporation has
not agreed to act as the Accounting Firm and an alternative Accounting Firm
has not been selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within ten (10)
Business Days following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice, each of
Buyer and Seller shall promptly select an accounting firm and promptly cause
such two accounting firms to mutually select a third independent accounting
firm to act as the Accounting Firm within twenty (20) Business Days of the
giving of the Dispute Submission Notice. The Accounting Firm will
promptly, in accordance with the rules set forth in the Accounting Firm's
engagement letter and its customary practices, review only those unresolved
items and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice
and resolve the dispute with respect to each such specific unresolved item
and amount in accordance with this Agreement. In resolving any disputed item,
the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller or
less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller, in
each case as presented to the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the
Accountants will be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount not awarded to such
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. The decision of
the Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement submitted to
it will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. As used herein, the
Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing
Statement, as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to by the parties and the
decision of the Accounting Firm, in each case, pursuant to this _Section
2.05_ , are referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ " and
the " _Final Closing Statement_ ", respectively. Each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Accounting Firm (including by executing a customary engagement letter
reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any
such dispute as soon as practicable after the commencement of the
Accounting Firm's engagement.

  



  

(f) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. If any of the Net Asset Value, the
Closing Debt Amount, Closing Cash Amount or the Seller Transaction
Expenses (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ and as set
forth in the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement)
differs from the Estimated Net Asset Value, the Estimated Closing Debt Amount,
the Estimated Closing Cash Amount and the Estimated Seller Transaction
Expenses set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, the Purchase Price
shall be recalculated using such final figures in lieu of such estimated
figures, and (i) Buyer shall (or shall cause the Companies to) pay to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount, if any, by
which such re-calculated final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price paid at Closing in accordance with _Sections 2.04(a) _and _2.05(b)_ or
(ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the amount, if any, by which such Estimated Purchase Price paid
at Closing in accordance with _Sections 2.04(a)_ and _2.05(b)_ exceeds such
re-calculated final Purchase Price. Any payment due pursuant to this _Section
2.05(f)_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the final amount
thereof has been determined in accordance with this _Section 2.05_.

6.09_ is invalid or unenforceable, the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to

(b) Without limiting the provisions of this _Section 6.11_ , from

obligations and duties under all floorplan agreements and any other
Contractual Obligations to which Seller is bound that Buyer deems necessary
to the ongoing operations of the Companies (said agreements collectively
referred to herein as the " _Assumed Obligations_ ") entered into by Seller
as a party, guarantor or other similar status that exist for the benefit of or
relate directly to any of the Companies; _provided_ , that these Assumed
Obligations shall be limited to those floorplan agreements and other
Contractual Obligations listed on _Schedule 6.11_ and, in each case, only to
the extent such Contractual Obligations relate to the Business and/or the
Companies. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Persons (as defined in _Section 10.02_) from, against
and in respect of any and all Losses (as defined in  _Section 10.01_ )
incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Persons or any of them as a

Obligations. Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall take
all reasonable steps to transfer all Assumed Obligations to Buyer such that
Buyer takes Seller's place as a party, guarantor or other similar status
under each of the Assumed Obligations as of the Closing Date. In furtherance
of the foregoing, Buyer hereby agrees that, if following the Closing Date,
(a) any of Buyer's Officers obtains actual knowledge of any floorplan,
repurchase or other related Contractual Obligation that would have, if known
to Seller on the date hereof, been included in the definition of
Assumed Obligations and set forth on _Schedule 6.11_ , or (b) the Seller
becomes aware of any such Contractual Obligation that Buyer and/or any of the
Companies utilizes, relies upon or benefits from and upon which Seller
continues to be obligated (whether as maker, guarantor or other form of
surety) and notifies Buyer promptly of such Contractual Obligation, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to immediately cease the incurrence
or creation of any further obligations of Seller under any such
Contractual Obligation (subject to any terms and conditions of such
Contractual Obligation). If within five (5) Business Days of any of
Buyer's Officers obtaining actual knowledge or Seller notifying Buyer of any
such Contractual Obligation, Buyer determines in its sole discretion to use
or continue to use such Contractual Obligation (each, an " _Additional Assumed
Obligation_ "), Buyer will provide written notice to Seller agreeing to take
all reasonable steps to transfer such Additional Assumed Obligation to Buyer
such that Buyer takes Seller's place as a party, guarantor or other similar
status under such Additional Assumed Obligation and to cause such Additional
Assumed Obligation to be treated as an Assumed Obligation under the terms of
this _Section 6.11(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if within such five
(5) Business Day period Buyer determines in its sole discretion not to use or
continue to use such Contractual Obligation, Buyer will provide written notice
to Seller agreeing not to use such Contractual Obligation and such
Contractual Obligation will be retained by Seller and will not be treated as
an Assumed Obligation under the terms of this _Section 6.11(b)_. For purposes
of this _Section 6.11(b)_ , " _Buyer 's Officers_" will mean Peter Guile,
President and Chief Executive Officer, and James R. Meyer, Chief Operating
Officer.

Section 10.04 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) _Notice of Third Party Claims_. Promptly after receipt by an
Indemnified Person of written notice of the assertion of a claim by
any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
that may give rise to an Indemnity Claim against an Indemnifying Party under
this _Article _X, the Indemnified Person shall give written notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this _Article _X, except to the
extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(b) _Assumption of Defense, _etc.__ The Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the
subject of a notice given by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person pursuant
to _Section 10.04(a)_. In addition, the Indemnifying Party will have the
right to defend the Indemnified Person against the Third Party Claim with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person so
long as (i) the Indemnifying Party gives written notice that they or it
will defend the Third Party Claim to the Indemnified Person within fifteen
(15) days after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party
Claim under _Section 10.04(a)_ stating that the Indemnifying Party will, and
thereby covenants to, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
10.01(b)_ and _Section 10.02(b)_ , as applicable, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Indemnified Person from and against the entirety of any and all
Losses the Indemnified Person may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Person with evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Person that the Indemnifying Party will have

Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Person, (iv) the Indemnified Person
has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party in connection with
the defense of the Third Party Claim, (v) the Third Party Claim does not
relate to or otherwise arise in connection with Taxes or any criminal or
regulatory enforcement Action, (vi) settlement of, an adverse judgment with
respect to, or conduct of the defense of the Third Party Claim by the

potential customers, suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of
its business) and (vii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently. The Indemnified Person may retain

(c) _Limitations on Indemnifying Party Control_. The Indemnifying
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person unless such
judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment by the
Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for the claimant, (ii) results in
the full and general release of all Indemnified Person from all liabilities
arising or relating to, or in connection with, the Third Party Claim and
(iii) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements
or the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be
made against the Indemnified Person.

  



  

(d) _Indemnified Person 's Control_. If the Indemnifying Party does
not deliver the notice contemplated by clause (i) of _Section 10.04(b)_, or
the evidence contemplated by clause (ii) of _Section 10.04(b)_, within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 10.04(a)_, or otherwise at any time fails to
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, the
Indemnified Person may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Person need
not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith). If such notice and evidence is given on a timely basis
and the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently but any of the other conditions in _Section
10.04(b)_ is or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Person may defend, and
may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment
consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without its
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Indemnified Person
conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section
10.04(b)_, the Indemnifying Party will (i) advance the Indemnified Person
promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and (ii) remain

incur or suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of
or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this

and Seller each hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any court in which any Third Party Claim may be brought against any
Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim which such Indemnified Person
may have against any such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement in
connection with such Third Party Claim, and in furtherance thereof, the
provisions of _Section 12.09_ are incorporated herein by reference, _mutatis_
_mutandis_.

  



  

Section 10.05 _No Circular Recovery_. Seller hereby agrees that it will not
make any claim for indemnification against Buyer or any Company by reason of
the fact that such Seller was a controlling person, director, employee or
Representative of a Company or was serving as such for another Person at the
request of a Company (whether such claim is for Losses of any kind or
otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any Legal Requirement,
Organizational Document, Contractual Obligation or otherwise) with respect
to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against Seller under this
Agreement or otherwise relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or
any of the Contemplated Transactions. With respect to any claim brought by a
Buyer Indemnified Person against Seller under this Agreement or otherwise
relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions, each Seller expressly waives any right of subrogation,
contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against any
Company with respect to any amounts owed by such Seller pursuant to this
_Article X_ or otherwise.

Section 10.06 _Remedies Cumulative_. The rights of each Buyer Indemnified
Person and Seller Indemnified Person under this _Article _X are cumulative,
and each Buyer Indemnified Person and Seller Indemnified Person will have the
right in any particular circumstance, in its sole discretion, to enforce any
provision of this _Article _X without regard to the availability of a
remedy under any other provision of this _Article _X.

  



  

Section 10.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Article XI_ (Tax Matters),
the parties hereto hereby agree that, from and after the Closing,
the indemnification rights provided in this _Article X_ will constitute the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any and all claims with respect to any
Losses arising under, out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
Contemplated Transactions, and that, except with respect to claims for actual
fraud and claims for equitable relief, no party hereto shall have any
liability, and no party hereto shall have any other remedy, entitlement or
recourse, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other laws or
otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties hereto to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

  



  

ARTICLE XI 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 11.01 _Tax Indemnification_. From and after the Closing Date,
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Person
from, against and in respect of any and all Losses that constitute or that
result from, arise out of or relate to, directly or indirectly (a) Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Companies for all Taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date
for any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (b) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Company is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar Legal Requirement and
(c) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on a Company as a transferee or
successor, pursuant to a Contractual Obligation, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 11.02 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_
"), the amount of any Taxes of the Companies based upon or measured by net
income or gain for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which any Company holds a beneficial interest will be deemed
to terminate at such time). The amount of Taxes other than Taxes of the
Companies based upon or measured by net income or gain for a Straddle Period
which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

  



    

-46- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Section 11.03 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar Contractual Obligations and all powers of attorney with respect to or
involving any Company will be terminated prior to the Closing and, after the
Closing, the Companies will not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

  



  

Section 11.04 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees
or recording charges incurred in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, will be treated as Seller Transaction Expenses Seller will, at
its expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges and, if required by applicable
Legal Requirements, Buyer will (and will cause its Affiliates to) join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

Section 11.05 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and Seller will cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer or Seller, in
connection with any Tax matters relating to the Companies (including by the
provision of reasonably relevant records or information). The party
requesting such cooperation will pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
the other parties. For any audit, examination or proceeding that relates
exclusively to any Tax Return (or otherwise relating to Taxes) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of any Company and that would not, in Buyer's reasonable
discretion, be expected to create any Tax liability for the Buyer,
Seller shall retain full authority and control for resolution of such audit,
examination or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Buyer shall
have the right to participate in such audit, examination or proceeding, and
(ii) Seller shall not settle or compromise any such audit, examination or
proceeding without the consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Seller shall keep Buyer informed of all such
proceedings, including by promptly providing Buyer with copies of
any notices, filings, deliveries or other correspondence in respect of such
proceedings, and by allowing Buyer to review and comment on any proposed
correspondence or communications to the IRS (or applicable governmental
authority), and any complaint, protest, brief, motion, petition, or any other
administrative or judicial filing, prior to its submission. Seller shall be
entitled to all tax refunds associated with Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Buyer
shall, to the extent reasonably necessary, provide cooperation in resolving
such pre-Closing tax matters.

Subject to the immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which such successors
and permitted assigns will be deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes
hereof. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either this

assignees and nothing herein expressed or implied will give or be construed
to give any Person, other than the parties hereto and such successors and
permitted assignees, any other right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
it is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that an
Indemnified Person that is not party hereto is intended to be an
express third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.03 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller, or in the case
of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy
in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or

party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will
operate as a waiver thereof.

  



  

Section 12.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the other
Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates
explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the

may be delivered by facsimile or electronic delivery ( _i.e_., by email of a

Section 12.06 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any
provision hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or
unenforceable in any respect, each party hereto intends that such provision
will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under,
applicable Legal Requirements.

hereunder and all Actions arising in whole or in part under or in
connection herewith, will be governed by and construed and enforced in

jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the
Northern District of Indiana, or if such Action may not be brought in federal
court, the state courts of the State of Indiana for the purpose of any Action
among any of the parties relating to or arising in whole or in part under or
in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Legal Requirements, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as
a defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action brought
in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of _forum non
conveniens_ , should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other Action in any other court other than one of the above-named courts or
that this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the subject matter hereof or
thereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to
commence any such Action other than before one of the above-named courts.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence a party may commence any Action in a
court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an
order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

  

     



  

(b) _Venue_. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that for
any Action among any of the parties relating to or arising in whole or
in part under or in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
or the Contemplated Transactions, such party shall bring such Action only in

commence any Action in a court other than the above-named courts solely for
the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named
courts. Each party hereto further waives any claim and will not assert that
venue should properly lie in any other location within the selected
jurisdiction.

(c) _Service of Process_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby (i) consents to service of process in any Action among any of
the parties hereto relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions in any manner permitted by Indiana law, (ii) agrees that service
of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to
_Section 12.01_, will constitute good and valid service of process in any
such Action and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any claim that service of process
made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid
service of process.

  



  

Section 12.09 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of
the parties agrees that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, the
other parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any Action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in addition to any other
remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party further
agrees that in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of
such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy
at law would be adequate.

  



  

Section 12.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND
COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN
PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND THAT SUCH
ACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE
SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.
