 **ARTICLE III** 
  
 EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

 ** **

  

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or any
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock
of Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Class B Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Parent or Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ and any Dissenters
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $26.00 (referred to
herein as the " _Per Share Amount_ ") in cash payable to the holder thereof
(the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock held by each stockholder of the Company, the " _Merger Consideration_
"). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section
3.03_ , without interest. The Per Share Amount shall be appropriately
adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split or like transaction affecting
the Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 3.02 _Dissenters  Shares_.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Dissenters Shares shall not be converted into the
right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ , but
rather the holders of Dissenters Shares shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenters Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair
value under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenters Shares shall cease and such
Dissenters Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section
3.01(c)_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of any such demands and any other documents received in
connection with any assertion of rights to payment of fair value under
Section 262 of the

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 3.03 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall select and appoint a commercial bank or trust company who shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of Certificates representing Company Common Stock. At the Closing, Parent
shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration under _Section 3.01(c)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ out of
the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration (or appropriate portion thereof) into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ , and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
otherwise not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.03_ , each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenters
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration (or
appropriate portion thereof), without interest, into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate.

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

Section 3.04 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration (or appropriate portion thereof) paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ upon conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.05 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and
any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.06 _No Liability_.  None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar applicable
law.

  



  

Section 3.07 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Parent, _provided_ , that such investments shall only be in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (it being understood that any and all interest
or income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be turned over to Parent).

  



  

Section 3.08 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be
paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion
of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with _Section 3.01(c)_ for the shares of Company Common Stock
represented thereby. When authorizing such payment of any portion of the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation may, in
its discretion, require such Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed to post a bond in customary amount and to make a
reasonable undertaking to indemnify Parent and

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against Parent
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

Section 3.09 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article III_ such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, or local law with respect to
Taxes. If Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds
any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable stockholder in respect of
which Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction or withholding.

SEC Documents, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

18   

     
   

  



  

omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company has timely responded to all
comment letters of the staff of the SEC relating to the Company SEC
Documents, and the SEC has not advised the Company that any final responses
are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. The Company has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all correspondence
between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any Company
Subsidiaries, on the other, occurring since December 31, 2002 and prior to

statements, for the absence of footnotes) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no liabilities, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be
disclosed on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
liabilities (i) stated or reserved against in the Financial Statements of the
Company included in the Filed Company SEC Documents or disclosed in
_Section 4.06(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) incurred in the
ordinary and usual course of business pursuant to Contracts or since December

reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B)
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
Nasdaq. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete

19   

     
   

  



  

(e) The Company has disclosure controls and procedures that are effective to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including the
Company Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities.

  



  

(f) The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Companys Board of Directors and to Parent (A) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

  



  

(g) As of the date hereof, the Company has not identified any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe
that its auditors and its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer

pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, when next due.

under Section 401(a) of the Code and the tax-exempt status of any trust which
forms a part of such plan under Section 501(a) of the Code, and to the
Knowledge of the Company there are no facts and circumstances that could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such letter except as

has occurred and no condition exists that could reasonably be expected to
subject the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to any material tax, fine,
Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA or the Code. No non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in ERISA Section 406 and
Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Company Plan.
Except as listed on _Section 4.10_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Company Plan provides post-retirement or post-termination health benefits and

24

proceedings.

  



  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability
under or with respect to any Multiemployer Plan.

  



  

(g) The consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement will
neither entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of

federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(h) All Company Plans that are maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries
outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of employees of the

under such Company Plan.

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate

complete copy of the commitment letter, dated as of May 10, 2005, between
Parent, Banc of America Securities LLC and Credit Suisse First Boston (the "

and Credit Suisse First Boston have agreed to provide the kinds and amounts
of financing set forth therein (the " _Financing_ "). Subject to the

to Sub, all funds necessary to consummate the Merger and pay the related fees
and expenses of Parent and Sub. None of the Financing Commitments has been

pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and any other repayment or refinancing
of Indebtedness contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments;
(ii) to pay all related fees and expenses; and (iii) to finance the
Surviving Corporations working capital and general corporate needs after the

satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the
Closing Date.

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity.

Parent and Sub of this Agreement, does not, and the consummation of the

cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation.

  



  

Section 7.05 _Stock Options and Restricted Shares_. (a) At the Award
Cancellation Time, each Company Restricted Share then outstanding shall
immediately vest and shall be treated in all respects in accordance with
_Section 3.01_; _provided_ , that the amount to which the holder of any
Company Restricted Share shall be entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01_ shall
be reduced by the amount of any required withholding taxes (including
any withholding taxes due as a result of the vesting of the Company
Restricted Shares).

  



  

(b) At the Award Cancellation Time, each Company Stock Option then
outstanding (whether vested or unvested), shall be canceled and, in
consideration of such cancellation, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
within 5 days following the Award Cancellation Time to each holder who has

termination and full satisfaction of such Company Stock Option, in full
satisfaction of such Company Stock Option, less any applicable withholding
taxes, an amount (but not less than zero) in cash equal to the product of (i)
the difference between (I) the Per Share Amount and (II) the exercise price
with respect to such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such outstanding Company Stock Option.

  



  

(c) The Company shall (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to cause
the actions and effects specified in _Sections 7.05(a)_ and _(b)_
to occur, (ii) take all actions reasonably necessary, with
Parents assistance, to ensure that, effective as of the Award Cancellation
Time, no holder of Company Stock Options will have any right to receive any
shares of capital stock of the Company or, if applicable, the Surviving
Corporation, upon exercise of any Company Stock Option or any other event and
(iii) provide its reasonable cooperation to Parent in connection with the
actions contemplated by this _Section 7.05_.

  



  

Section 7.06 _Indemnification; D andO Insurance_. (a) From the Effective
Time through the sixth anniversary thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless any person (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a
party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, claim, litigation,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether predicated on foreign, federal, state or local law and whether formal
or informal (collectively for purposes of this _Section 7.06_, " _action(s)_
"), by reason of his status as, or the fact that he is or was, a director
and/or an

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

executive officer (collectively for purposes of this _Section 7.06_, "
_executive(s)_ ") of the Company, and/or is or was serving as an executive
officer or director of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
employee benefit plan, trust or other similar enterprise affiliated with the
Company (any and/or all of which are referred to in this _Section 7.06_ as
an " _affiliate_ "), and as to acts performed in the course of such
executives duty to the Company and/or to an affiliate, in each case against
expenses, fees, costs and charges (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by or on behalf of an
executive in connection with any action (including in connection with the
investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such action) that pertains to
a matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law. Expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by any Indemnified Party in defending any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be
paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Section 7.06(a)_. The indemnification rights
hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may
have under the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or otherwise. The
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor, provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those set forth in the
Company Charter and Company By-laws as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnified Parties. The parties
agree that the provisions relating to exoneration of directors and officers
and the rights to indemnification (including provisions relating to advances
of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit) in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters occurring through the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any action pending or asserted or claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
7.06(a)_ shall promptly notify Parent upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the failure to so notify shall
not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if
such failure does not materially prejudice Parent.

  



  

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 300% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the " _Current Premium_ "), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current
Premium; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent may satisfy its obligations
under this _Section 7.06(c)_ by obtaining "tail" insurance policies at the
Effective Time that provide substantially similar coverage.

  



  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.06_.

  



  

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that an Indemnified Party
may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other rights and obligations
provided for in this _Section 7.06_.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

  



  

Section 7.07 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange.

  



  

Section 7.08 _Director Resignations_. At the Closing the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of all directors of the Company and, as specified by
Parent reasonably in advance of the Closing, all directors of each Company
Subsidiary, in each case, effective at the Effective Time.

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

 **Section 7.09** ** **_Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes, if any, and any
penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes, payable by Parent,
Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the consummation of the
Merger, and all Stock Transfer Taxes, if any, and any penalties or interest
with respect to any such Stock Transfer Taxes payable by Parent, Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be paid by either Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and shall not be paid out of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) Subject to _Section
7.10(c)_, Parent intends to, or to cause its affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, provide: (i) each person who is
employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date (the " _Company Employees_ ") with terms and conditions of employment
(including wages, salary, bonus and other compensation opportunities) that
are, at Parents sole option, either (A) substantially similar in the
aggregate to those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B)
no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent, and (ii) Company Employees (and, to the extent applicable, any former
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Former Company
Employees_ ")) with employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that are, at Parents sole option, either (A) substantially
similar in the aggregate to those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (B) no less favorable than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent.

  



  

(b) To the extent applicable with respect to employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements that are established or maintained by
Parent or its affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
for the benefit of Company Employees or Former Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents), Company Employees and Former Company Employees (and
their eligible dependents) shall be given credit for their service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) for all purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual under a defined benefit
pension plan) to the extent such service was taken into account under a
corresponding Company Plan, and (ii) to the extent permitted by the plan
maintained by Parent, for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations and shall be given credit for amounts paid under a
corresponding Company Plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained by Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.10(b)_, service and other amounts
shall not be credited to Company Employees or Former Company Employees (or
their eligible dependents) to the extent the crediting of such service
or other amounts would result in the duplication of benefits.

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 7.10_ shall require Parent, the Company or any
of their affiliates to continue to employ any Company Employee for any
period after the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 7.11 _Actions Respecting Commitment Letters; Financing;
Notification_. (a) Parent and its affiliates shall perform all obligations
required to be performed by them in accordance with and pursuant to the
Financing Commitments and shall not amend, terminate or waive any provisions
under the Financing Commitments if the effect thereof would be reasonably
likely to prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms set forth in the Financing Commitments.

  



  

(c) Parent shall provide prompt written notice to the Company following its
receipt of notification by a potential financing source under the Financing
Commitments of its refusal or intended refusal to provide the financing
described in the Financing Commitments and, in each case, the stated reasons
therefor. In any such event, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain substitute debt financing for such financing to consummate promptly
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, unless the cost of
capital to Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
substitute debt financing exceeds the cost of capital under the Financing
Commitments (provided that for purposes of calculating such cost of capital,
it shall be assumed that spreads were increased by the maximum amount
permitted under the Financing Commitments).

Section 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  



  

Section 10.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule and
all exhibits and schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement, taken
together, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the Merger. Other than _Article III_, _Section 3.01(c)_, _Section 7.05_ and
Section 7.06, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

  



  

Section 10.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

  



  

Section 10.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 10.09 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

or in equity.
