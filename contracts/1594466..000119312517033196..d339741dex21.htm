advance notice of intent to withhold any amount payable to Contributor. To the

the conveyance of such title to any Company Group Member from its immediate
predecessor in title are recorded with the Governmental Authority that issued
any such Lease;

methodology that reasonably attributes to each such Lease or leasehold tract
its share of such production.

 

3.4 _Allocated Values_. _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ set forth the agreed
allocation of the Unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets. The "
_Allocated Value_ " for any Property equals the portion of the Unadjusted

-20- 3.5 _Environmental Assessment; Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Acquiror shall have the right
to conduct, or cause a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm
(the " _Environmental Consultant_ "), to conduct, an environmental review of
Assets as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (the " _Environmental Review_
"). Contributor shall have the right to have a representative of Contributor
accompany the Acquiror during any such Environmental Review.

(b) Except as expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, Acquirors
Environmental Review shall be limited to conducting a Phase I Environmental

I Environmental Site Assessment Process, or a similar visual evaluation of the
Assets that does not involve the sampling of any environmental media or the
operation of any equipment, and an environmental compliance review (each, a "
_Site Assessment_ _"_ ). In the event that Acquirors Site Assessment
identifies actual or potential "recognized environmental conditions" with
respect to any Assets which are operated or solely owned by a Company Group
Member and Acquiror reasonably believes that sampling of environmental media
is necessary to prove that an Environmental Defect exists or to establish the
Environmental Defect Amount, then Acquiror may request in writing that the
Contributor cause the applicable Company Group Member to grant permission to
Acquiror to conduct Phase II Environmental Assessments to further assess such
conditions (each a " _Phase II_ _Request_ "). Each Phase II Request will
state with reasonable specificity (i) the actual or potential "recognized
environmental conditions" that require further investigation in order to prove
that an Environmental Defect exists or to establish the Environmental Defect
Amount and (ii) the proposed scope of the Phase II Environmental Assessment
and Phase II Environmental Assessment plan, including a description of the
activities to be conducted, and a description of the approximate location and
expected timing of such activities. Acquiror shall not have the right to
conduct any activities set forth in such Phase II Environmental Assessment
plan until such time that Contributor has caused the applicable Company Group
Member to approve such plan in writing. If requested by Contributor, Acquiror
shall modify its Phase II Environmental Assessment Plan to address
Contributors reasonable comments, which Contributor will promptly provide
following receipt of the applicable Phase II Request. Contributor shall not
unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its approval of any of any Acquiror
Phase II Request and upon such approval shall cause the applicable Company
Group Member to grant Acquiror permission and access to conduct such Phase II
Environmental Assessment. Any such approved Phase II Environmental Assessment
plan shall be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering
firm, and in a safe and prudent manner. Contributor shall have the right to
have its representatives witness all on-site activities set forth in the
applicable Phase II Environmental Assessment plan and split any samples
collected in connection therewith.

 

(c) Contributor shall, and shall cause each Company Group Member, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission from the operator of
each Property for Acquiror or the Environmental Consultant to conduct the
Environmental Review. If obtained prior to Closing, Acquiror shall provide
copies of any final environmental reports generated by the Environmental
Consultant to Contributor promptly after receipt thereby by Acquiror. Except
(i) as may be necessary for, or permitted pursuant to, the exercise of the
rights and fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under this Agreement,
(ii) as may be required by applicable Law, or

 



-21-  (iii) for information which is or becomes public knowledge through no fault
of the Person against whom this sentence is sought to be enforced, Acquiror
and Contributor and their respective Affiliates shall maintain, and shall
cause their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors,
consultants (including the Environmental Consultant), and other advisors to
maintain, all information, reports (whether interim, draft, final, or
otherwise), data, work product, and other matters obtained or generated from
or attributable to the Environmental Review (the " _Environmental Information_
") strictly confidential, and shall not disclose all or any portion of
the Environmental Information to any third Person without the consent of
Acquiror or Contributor, as applicable, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each Party shall be responsible
for the compliance of its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, contractors, consultants (including the Environmental
Consultant), and other advisors with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Environmental Defect_ " means (i)
any condition, matter, obligation, circumstance (in each case, whether or not
disclosed to Acquiror prior to the date of this Agreement) with respect to the
Assets that constitutes a violation of Environmental Law, or (ii) the
existence of any environmental pollution, contamination, degradation, damage
or injury to the environment where remedial or corrective action is presently
required (or if known, would be presently required) under applicable
Environmental Laws

nature.

3.7  _Cure_.

(a) Contributor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Contributors sole cost, risk, and expense, to cure or remove, on or before
one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the " _Cure Date_
"), any alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects of which Contributor

provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.8(c)_ for purposes of Closing and thereafter any
adjustment required under _Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_ with respect thereto shall

-24- (b) With respect to any alleged Title Defect or Environmental Defect which
Contributor has elected to cure pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_ above,
subject to the determination by the Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator, as applicable, of the existence or Title Defect Amount or
Environmental Defect Amount with respect to such a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect, as applicable, to the extent any such Title Defect or

Defect, as determined prior to Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.9(a)_,
and (ii) in the case of an Environmental Defect, an amount (the "
_Environmental Defect Amount_ ") determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.9(c)_.

(b) With respect to each Property affected by Title Benefits reported under
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_, the amount by which the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced on account of Title Defects shall be offset by an amount (the
" _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for
such Property caused by such Title Benefit, as determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.9(b)_.

 

(c) Contributor and Acquiror shall attempt to agree in writing upon all the
existence of any Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects
reported pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(c)_ above, as applicable, and any corresponding Title
Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts on or
before the Closing Date. If Contributor and Acquiror are unable to agree in
writing by the Closing Date, then, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, the Title
Defects, Title Benefits and Environmental Defects reported pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.6(c)_,
as applicable, and any corresponding Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit
Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts which are then in dispute (each a "
_Disputed Matter_ ") shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.10_.

 



-25- (d) At Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted by reducing
both the Cash Purchase Price and the Unit Purchase Price pro rata based on
the proportions that each bear to the total Unadjusted Purchase Price, (i) in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_ with respect to any Title Defects
or Environmental Defects which (A) Contributor has not elected to cure
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_ and (B) which are not Disputed Matters and
(ii) in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.8(b)_ with respect to any Title
Benefits which are not Disputed Matters.

(e) At Closing, the Cash Purchase Price and the Unit Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to (x) the sum of all Title Defect Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts (as asserted in good faith by Acquiror in the
applicable Title Defect notices or Environmental Defect notices provided in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.6(c)_, as
applicable) related to (i) any Title Defects or Environmental Defects which
Contributor elects to cure pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_ or (ii) which
are Disputed Matters less (y) the sum of all Title Benefit Amounts (as
asserted in good faith by Contributor in the applicable Title Benefit notices
provided in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_) related to any Title
Benefits which are Disputed Matters ((x) minus (y), the " _Defect Escrow
Amount_ "), with such reduction to be made to the Cash Purchase Price (the
amount by which the Cash Purchase Price is so reduced, the " _Defect Escrow
Cash Amount_ ") and the Unit Purchase Price (the amount by which the Unit
Purchase Price is so reduced, the " _Defect Escrow Unit Amount_ " and, the
Defect Escrow Unit Amount divided by the Per Share Value, the " _Escrowed
Defect Units_ ") pro rata based on the proportions that each bears to the
total Unadjusted Purchase Price. At the Closing, Acquiror shall deposit the
Defect Escrow Cash Amount and the Escrowed Defect Units (and a corresponding
number of shares of Class B Common Stock) into an escrow account established
with the Escrow Agent (the " _Defect Escrow Account_ "). The Escrowed Defect
Units (and the corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock) to be
deposited into the Defect Escrow Account will be issued in the name of the
Unit Recipients, whether in book-entry or certificated form, with each Unit
Recipient being issued such Unit Recipients Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed
Defect Units (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock).
The Acquiror and Contributor Representative shall, at the Closing, enter into
an escrow agreement (the " _Defect Escrow_ _Agreement_ ") with the Escrow
Agent an escrow agreement governing the Defect Escrow Account, which Defect
Escrow Agreement shall be in customary form (which the Parties agree shall
provide for the prompt disbursement from the escrow account to the registered
holders of Escrowed Defect Units any tax distributions made in respect of such
Escrowed Defect Units pursuant Section 6.2 of the AandR LLC Agreement) and shall
contain terms and provisions consistent with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.8_;
_provided,_ _howeve_ r, that if the such Parties are unable to enter into any
such Defect Escrow Agreement or otherwise deposit the Defect Escrow Cash
Amount and Escrowed Defect Units into the Defect Escrow Account, then the
Parties shall provide for appropriate alternative arrangements to give effect
to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.8_. The Escrowed Defect Units and
Defect Escrow Cash Amount shall be held and disbursed in accordance with the
terms of this _Article_ __ _ 3_ and the Defect Escrow Agreement pending the
curing or resolution of the applicable Title Defects, Environmental Defects or
Title Benefits. Each disbursement of Escrowed Defect Units pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.8_ and the Defect Escrow Agreement shall be accompanied by a
disbursement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock.
Whenever any disbursement of Escrowed Defect Units is made, such disbursement
shall be comprised of Escrowed Defect Units (and the corresponding number of
shares of Class B Common Stock) registered in the name of all Unit Recipients,
with each Unit Recipient bearing or receiving, as applicable, its Pro Rata
Share of such disbursement.

 



-26-  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no fractional Acquiror
Units or fractional shares of Common Stock shall be disbursed from the Defect
Escrow Account, and, to the extent that any such fractional security would be
required to be so disbursed but for this sentence, such fractional security
shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number of the applicable
securities. For the avoidance of doubt, the Defect Escrow Account and Defect
Escrow Agreement established for the Defect Escrow Amount and the Indemnity
Holdback Escrow Account and Indemnity Holdback Escrow Agreement established
for the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Amount shall be independent of and separate
from the Deposit Escrow Account and Deposit Escrow Agreement established for
the Deposit.

(f) Within ten (10) Business Days after the latter of the Cure Date or the
determination of all Disputed Matters submitted to a Title Arbitrator or
Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.10(a)_ or _Section_ __
_ 3.10(b)_, as applicable, the Parties shall, after giving effect to the
limitations provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_, execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing it to deliver (i) to Acquiror, an
amount equal to (x) the sum of the Title Defect Amounts associated with (i)
those Title Defects which Contributor elected to cure pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.7(a)_ which are not Disputed Matters and which are not fully cured as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ ( _provided_ , _however_ , if curative
efforts by Contributor mitigated an uncured Title Defect, the Title Defect
Amount associated with such Title Defect shall be revised pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.9(a)_ to take into account such curative efforts) and (ii)
any Disputed Title Matters determined in favor of Acquiror by the applicable
Title Arbitrator under _Section_ __ _ 3.10_, less (y) any offsetting Title
Benefits which are Disputed Title Matters and are determined in favor of
Contributor by the Title Arbitrator under _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ plus (z) the
sum of the Environmental Defect Amounts associated with (i) those
Environmental Defects which Contributor elected to cure pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.7(a)_ which are not Disputed Matters and which are not fully cured as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ ( _provided_ , _however_ , if curative
efforts by Contributor mitigated an uncured Environmental Defect, the
Environmental Defect Amount associated with such Environmental Defect shall be
revised pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.9(c)_ to take into account such
curative efforts) and (ii) any Disputed Environmental Matters, determined in
favor of Acquiror by the applicable Environmental Arbitrator under  _Section_
__ _ 3.10_, with such amount to be disbursed from the Defect Escrow Cash
Amount and the Escrowed Defect Units, pro rata based on the proportions that
each bears to the total value contained in the Defect Escrow Account (valuing
the Escrowed Defect Units at the Per Share Value for such purpose) and any
amount disbursed in Escrowed Defect Units shall be disbursed by delivering a
number of Escrowed Defect Units equal to the amount of the portion of such
distribution to be disbursed in Escrowed Defect Units and (ii) to
Contributor, the remainder of the Defect Escrow Cash Amount and the Escrowed
Defect Units. The Parties shall treat for Tax purposes, any amounts paid
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.8(f)_ as an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price.

3.9 _Calculation of Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts_.

(a) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

(i) if Acquiror and Contributor agree in writing upon the Title Defect Amount,
then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



-27- (ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which secures
the payment of an undisputed liquidated amount, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the amount necessary to be paid to unconditionally remove the Title
Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 

(iii) if the Title Defect solely represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest of any Company Group Member for any Well that is a Title
Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on _Exhibit_
__ _ B_, and there is no discrepancy with respect to the applicable Company
Group Members Working Interest in such Well and the Working Interest stated
therefor on _Exhibit_ __ _ B_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the absolute amount of such Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ B_ for such Title Defect Property; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property
throughout its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined
under this _Section 3.9(a)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect solely represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Acres of any Company Group Member for any Title Defect Property and (B) the
Net Acres stated therefor on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_, and there is no discrepancy
with respect to the applicable Company Group Members Net Revenue Interest in
such Title Defect Property and the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on
_Exhibit_ __ _ A_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the absolute value of the Net Acre decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Acres stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ for such
Title Defect Property;

 

(v) if the Title Defect is not of the type described in _clauses (i)_ through
_(iv)_ above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the
Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life
of the Title Defect Property, the values placed on such Title Defect by
Contributor and Acquiror and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation;

 

(vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably capable of being cured, the Title Defect
Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing
such Title Defect; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the same Title Defect
affects multiple Properties, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect
shall include the amounts calculated as provided in this _Section 3.9(a)_
for all of the Properties affected by such Title Defect;

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to each Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(A) an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given
prior to the Defect Claim Date in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_
shall only generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under this
_Article_ __ _ 3_ if the Title Defect Amount with respect thereto

the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any given Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such
Property; and

 

(C) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for Title
Defects unless and until the aggregate of (w) all Title Defect Amounts which
would generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to

(b) The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be
determined as follows:

(i) if Acquiror and Contributor agree in writing upon the Title Benefit

_Exhibit_ __ _ A_, and there is no discrepancy with respect to the
applicable Company Group Members Net Revenue Interest in such Title Benefit
Property and the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_,
then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of

Title Benefit over the life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed
upon the Title Benefit Property by Acquiror and Contributor and such other
reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(v) the Title Benefit Amount with respect to a Title Benefit shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Benefit Amount or adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ __ _ 3_, an
individual claim for a Title Benefit shall only generate an offset to the
amount by which the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced on account of
Title Defects pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.8(b)_ if the Title Benefit
Amount with respect thereto exceeds Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000).

of any costs or losses included in another Environmental Defect Amount or
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Article_ __ _ 3_:

(A) an individual claim for an Environmental Defect shall only generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price if the Environmental Defect
Amount with respect thereto exceeds Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000);
and

 

(B) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate of (w) all Title Defect
Amounts which would generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.9(a)(viii)(A)_, _less_ (x) all Title Benefit
Amounts that would generate an offset to Title Defect Amounts pursuant to
_Section 3.9(b)(vi)_ , _plus_ (y) all Environmental Defect Amounts which would
generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.9(c)(iv)(A)_, _plus_  (z) the amount equal to the absolute value of
the Negative Allocated Value Adjustment Amount exceeds two and one-half
percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent
that such aggregate amount exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

perform its obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction
Agreement to which it is party and to consummate the Transactions contemplated

after the date of this Agreement, the Contributor Parties shall, and shall
use their reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates to, make available to

any and all books, records, information and documents that are attributable to
the Company Group or the Assets in the Contributor Parties or their
Affiliates possession or control reasonably required by the Acquiror Parties,
their Affiliates and their agents and representatives, in order for the
Acquiror Parties or their Affiliates to prepare, if required to comply with
the requirements of the Securities Laws in connection with such Filings,
financial statements relating to the Company Group meeting the requirements of

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.9(a)_, from and after the

in connection with any audit by Acquirors Auditor of any financial
statements of the Company Group that the Acquiror Parties or any of their
Affiliates require to comply with the requirements of the Securities Laws.
Such cooperation will include (i) reasonable access to the Contributor
Groups and the Company Groups officers, managers, employees, agents and
representatives who were responsible for preparing or maintaining the
financial records and work papers and other supporting documents used in the
preparation of such financial statements as may be required by Acquirors
Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards or to otherwise verify

 



-59-  such financial statements, (ii) delivery of one or more customary
representation letters from the Contributor Group or the Company Group to

allow such auditors to complete an audit (or review of any financial

financial statements required pursuant to this  _Section 6.9(b),_ (iii)
using reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the independent auditor(s)
of the Company Group that conducted any audit of such financial statements to
be named as an expert in any Filing or offering memorandum for any equity or

cause the independent auditor(s) of the Company Group that conducted any audit

Parties, within ten (10) Business Days after demand in writing therefor, for
any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Contributor Parties or their
Affiliates in complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.9_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand the
Contributor Parties representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements
set forth in this Agreement or give the Acquiror Parties, their Affiliates, or
any third Person any rights to which it is not entitled hereunder.

 

(c) Without limiting _Sections 6.9(a)_ and _6.9(b)_ , the Contributor Parties
shall provide Acquiror Parent with (i) audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016
and (ii) to the extent required to comply with applicable Securities Laws,
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company Group as of March
31, 2017 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, in each case,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event
within seventy (70) days after the Closing Date) and prepared on the same
basis as the Contributor Financial Statements.

6.10 _Conduct of Acquiror Group_. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 6.10_ or
with the prior written consent of Contributor, from the Execution Date until
the Closing, each Acquiror Party shall, and shall cause the other Acquiror

and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Acquiror Party
shall not:

(a) amend its Organizational Documents;

(b) repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock for less
than fair market value (other than (i) the repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition or retirement for value of any such capital stock held by any
current or former director or employee of any Acquiror Group Member pursuant
to any director or employee equity subscription agreement or plan, stock
option agreement or similar agreement or plan or (ii) in connection with the
exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights by way of cashless
exercise); or declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution
payable in cash, shares of its capital stock, property, rights or otherwise
with respect to any shares of its capital stock;

 



-60- (c) adopt any plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation,

(d) take any action that would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or

reasonably necessary for the Class A Common Stock to be issued upon the
exchange of the Acquiror Units comprising the Unit Purchase Price to be
accepted by the NYSE for issuance and approved for listing thereon from and
after the time of Closing, subject to official notice of issuance. If Acquiror
Parent applies to have its Class A Common Stock or other securities traded on
any principal stock exchange or market other than the NYSE, it shall include
in such application the Class A Common Stock to be issued upon the exchange of
the Acquiror Units comprising the Unit Purchase Price and will take such other
action as is necessary to cause such Class A Common Stock to be issued upon
the exchange of the Acquiror Units comprising the Unit Purchase Price to be so
listed.

 

6.12 _[Reserved]_.

 

6.13 _New Properties_. The Parties agree to the terms and provisions contained
in _Schedule 6.13_ attached hereto.

 

6.14 _Employees_.

 

(a) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
Contributor shall provide to Acquiror a list of the Available Employees to
whom Acquiror or an Affiliate of Acquiror (such entity that makes employment
offers the " _Acquiror Employer_ ") may make offers of employment. Any offer
of employment by Acquiror Employer to any Available Employee shall be made no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Transition Services Termination Date
and be for employment beginning on the Transition Services Termination Date
and subject to satisfaction of Acquiror Employers regular pre-hiring drug,
background and qualification screening requirements and shall be on terms and
conditions determined by Acquiror Employer in its sole discretion that are
consistent with the terms of this _Section 6.14_. Contributor, Contributor
Representative and their respective Affiliates shall provide Acquiror and its
Affiliates, as applicable, with reasonable access to the Available Employees
in order to evaluate and/or interview such Available Employees and facilitate
such offers, and shall not take any action to discourage any Available
Employee from accepting an offer of employment from Acquiror Employer that is
consistent with this _Section 6.14_. On or before the date that is fifteen 

 



-61-  (15) days prior to the Transition Services Termination Date, Acquiror shall
provide Contributor Representative with written notice of which Available
Employees have received the offers contemplated by this _Section 6.14_ and
which have accepted such offers. Those Available Employees who accept such
offers and become employees of Acquiror Employer are referred to as the "
_Transferred Employees_." A Transferred Employee shall become an employee of
Acquiror Employer as of the "Transfer Date," which, for each Transferred
Employee, shall be the Transition Services Termination Date, except with
respect to any Available Employee to whom an employment offer is made and who
is not Actively Employed as of the Transition Services Termination Date, in
which case the Transfer Date shall be the date upon which such individual is
able to and does commence active duty with Acquiror Employer following the
Transition Services Termination Date. "Actively Employed" shall mean that the
individual is an employee of Contributor Representative or its Affiliate or
designee on the day immediately prior to the Transition Services Termination
Date and on the Transition Services Termination Date such individual is not on
a leave of absence. It is understood and agreed that any Transferred Employee
who is not Actively Employed as of the Transition Services Termination
Date shall not become an employee of Acquiror Employer or be eligible to
participate in any employee benefit plan of Acquiror Employer at any time
prior to his or her Transfer Date.

 

(b) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Transition
Services Termination Date or such shorter period as a Transferred Employee is
employed with Acquiror Employer, Acquiror Employer shall ensure that such
Transferred Employee is provided with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, and bonus opportunities (on a pro rata basis for the portion of
the current year such Transferred Employee is employed by Contributor,
Contributor Representative or any of their respective Affiliates or designees
that employ such Transferred Employee prior to the Transition Services
Termination Date) no less favorable than those set forth on the schedule
provided to Acquiror by Contributor no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date hereof, and (ii) such other compensation and employee
benefits, as applicable, and incentive and bonus opportunities (on a pro rata
basis for the portion of the current year such Transferred Employee is
employed by Acquiror Employer) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Acquiror Employer.

(c) No later than each Transferred Employees Transfer Date, Contributor
Representative or its Affiliate or designee will provide to Acquiror such
Transferred Employees recognized credited service (identifying the purpose of
such recognized credited service with respect to each applicable plan) under
the applicable Contributor Benefit Plans as of the day immediately prior to
such Transfer Date. Acquiror Employer shall provide with respect to each
Transferred Employee full credit for eligibility, vesting (but not vesting
under any equity-based award) and benefit accrual purposes (but not
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under each applicable
Employee Benefit Plan of Acquiror and its Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Acquiror Plans_ ") for such Transferred Employees service with
Contributor, Contributor Representative and their respective Affiliates and
designees, if any, that employ such Transferred Employee prior to the Transfer
Date, to the same extent recognized by such entities for corresponding
purposes immediately prior to the Transfer Date; _provided, that_ , to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
Acquiror Employer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or
cause to be provided to each Transferred

 



-62-  Employee and his or her eligible dependents credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid during the plan year prior to becoming eligible to
participate in any Acquiror Plans under the analogous Contributor Benefit
Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under such Contributor
Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or annual maximum out-
of-pocket requirements under the applicable Acquiror Plan for such year.
Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Acquiror Plan
that provides welfare benefits and with respect to which a Transferred
Employee is eligible to participate to waive any pre-existing condition
restrictions applicable to such Transferred Employee and his or her eligible
dependents and to provide eligibility for coverage to such individuals
immediately upon the date such individual loses coverage under a corresponding
Contributor Benefit Plan.

 

(d) If a Transferred Employees employment with Acquiror Employer is
terminated during the twelve (12)-month period following the Closing Date
pursuant to an Involuntary Termination (as defined below), then the Acquiror
Employer shall provide severance pay to such Transferred Employee in an amount
equal to the sum of (i) four (4) months of such Transferred Employees base
salary or base wage rate (assuming 40-hour workweeks), and (ii) one-third of
such Transferred Employees target level annual bonus opportunity for the
calendar year in which the termination of such Transferred Employees
employment occurs (or, if no such annual bonus opportunity exists, one-third
of the amount of the annual bonus, if any, paid to such Transferred Employee
for the immediately preceding calendar year), paid in a lump sum cash
payment no later than sixty (60) days following the date of the termination
of such Transferred Employees employment, provided that such Transferred
Employee executes, and does not revoke within any revocation period provided,
a release agreement in a form provided by Acquiror Employer releasing all
claims against Contributor, Contributor Representative and their respective
Affiliates, Acquiror Employer and specified related entities and other Persons
and providing other terms and conditions as deemed appropriate by Acquiror
Employer, and such release agreement becomes effective prior to the sixtieth
(60th) day following the date of the termination of such
Transferred Employees employment. For purposes of this _Section 6.14(d)_, "
_Involuntary Termination_ " means, with respect to a Transferred Employee, any
termination of his or her employment with Acquiror Employer that does
not result from a resignation by such Transferred Employee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the term "Involuntary Termination" shall not include a
termination due to such Transferred Employees (A) misconduct or material
failure to perform employment-related duties, (B) indictment for any felony
or a misdemeanor involving alleged moral turpitude, or (C) embezzlement or
other misappropriation of funds or assets.

 

(e) No later than each Transferred Employees Transfer Date, Contributor
Representative will provide to Acquiror the Transferred Employees current
vacation time, sick time and other time-off balances under the applicable
Contributor Benefit Plans as of the day immediately prior to such Transfer
Date. Acquiror Employer shall credit each Transferred Employee with
the amount of accrued but unused vacation time, sick time and other time-off
benefits as such Transferred Employee had accrued with Contributor,
Contributor Representative and any of their respective Affiliates and
designees that employ such Transferred Employee prior to such Transferred
Employees Transfer Date as of the Transfer Date.

 



-63- (f) On or before the Transfer Date of each Transferred Employee, Contributor
Representative shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or designee to, take any
necessary action to fully vest as of such date the Transferred Employees
account balances and other benefits under all Contributor Benefit Plans that
are employee pension benefit plans (as such term is defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA, determined without regard to Section 4(b) of ERISA).

(g) Contributor and Contributor Representative shall remain liable for, or
cause one of their Affiliates or designees to remain liable for, all covered
claims for health, accident, sickness, life and disability benefits that are
deemed incurred while a Transferred Employee or his or her eligible
dependents are covered under a Contributor Benefit Plan providing such
benefits, and Acquiror or its Affiliate (including Acquiror Employer) shall be
liable for all such covered claims by such Transferred Employee or his or her
eligible dependents that are deemed incurred while such Transferred Employee
or his or her eligible dependents are covered under an Acquiror Plan providing
such benefits. For purposes of this paragraph, (A) a claim for
health benefits (including claims for medical, prescription drug and dental
expenses) will be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which the actual
medical service, treatment or material was rendered to or received by the
Transferred Employee or eligible dependent claiming such benefit and (B) in
the case of any claim for benefits other than those designated in the
preceding clause (A) (such as a claim for life insurance or disability
benefits), a claim will be deemed to have been incurred upon the occurrence
of the event giving rise to such claim. Claims for workers compensation
benefits for a Transferred Employee arising out of occurrences prior to such
Transferred Employees Transfer Date shall be the responsibility of
Contributor, Contributor Representative or any of their Affiliates or
designees that employ such Transferred Employee prior to such Transferred
Employees Transfer Date. Claims for workers compensation benefits for
a Transferred Employee arising out of occurrences on or after such
Transferred Employees Transfer Date shall be the responsibility of Acquiror
or its Affiliate (including Acquiror Employer).

 

(h) Contributor Representative shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates or
designees to, provide COBRA continuation coverage (within the meaning of
section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) to all
individuals who are M and A qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned
to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury Regulation section 54.4980B-9)
with respect to the Transactions for the duration of the period to which such
individuals are entitled to such coverage. Contributor Representative shall
take any and all necessary actions to ensure that Acquiror and its Affiliates
are not required to provide such continuation coverage to any such individual
at any time.

(i) Acquiror shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Contributor, Contributor Representative and their respective
Affiliates with respect to, any and all losses, liability and expenses
(including Taxes, penalties, judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement, costs of investigation and preparations, and fees, expenses, and
disbursements of attorneys) arising out of or in connection with the selection
process and decisions for selection of Available Employees for offers of
employment as contemplated by  _Section 6.14(a)_, and the employment of the
Transferred Employees by Acquiror or its Affiliates on and following each
Transferred Employees Transfer Date.

 

(j) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Acquiror, Contributor, Contributor Representative, or
any of their respective Affiliates. The provisions of this _Section 6.14_ are
for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, 

 



-64-  expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or
give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Entity Employee
or other current or former employee (or spouse or dependent thereof) of
Contributor, Contributor Representative or any of their respective Affiliates
or designees), other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.14_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall give any Transferred Employee or any other Person any right
to continued employment or service, nor shall this Agreement restrict the
right of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or
service of any employee or service provider after the Closing.

 

(k) Other than as contemplated by this _Section 6.14_, for the period
beginning on the Transition Services Termination Date and ending on the date
that is one year after the Transition Services Termination Date: (i)
Contributor, Contributor Representative and their Affiliates will not solicit
or induce for employment any Transferred Employee; and (ii) neither Acquiror
nor its Affiliates will solicit or induce for employment any Entity Employee
who is not a Transferred Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 6.14(k)_ shall prevent a Party or its Affiliate from
making general solicitations of employment not targeted at a particular
Entity Employee or group of Entity Employees or hiring any individual who
responds to such a solicitation.

 

(l) None of the Acquiror Parties shall have any obligations under the WARN Act
with respect to any of the Entity Employees who do not become Transferred
Employees. Contributor Representative or its Affiliate shall bear any and all
obligations and liability under the WARN Act owed to all Entity Employees who
do not become Transferred Employees resulting, directly or indirectly, from
any of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

6.15 _Termination of Affiliate Agreements_. On or before the Closing
Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 6.15_, the Contributor Parties shall
cause all Affiliate Agreements to be terminated without any liability or
obligation on the part of the Company Group from and after the Closing.

 

6.16 _Further Assurances_. After Closing, Contributor and Acquiror Parties
each agree to take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge, and
deliver all such further documents as are reasonably requested by the other
for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

6.17 _Credit Agreement Consent_. Acquiror shall obtain, prior to the End Date,
the consent of the necessary lenders under the Credit Agreement to permit (i)
the acquisition by Acquiror of the Company Group Interests and (ii) any other
action required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Credit Agreement Consent_ "). The Parties acknowledge that a breach
or failure to perform the covenants set forth in this section shall, for the
avoidance of doubt, be a material breach resulting in a failure of the
conditions to Closing of the Contributor Parties, and the Contributor Parties
shall be entitled to exercise their remedies set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_
with respect thereto.

 



-65- 6.18 _Amendment of Acquiror LLC Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, Acquiror
shall amend and restate the LLC Agreement (as amended, the " _A andR LLC
Agreement_") to include the terms set forth on _Exhibit G_ hereto. Subject to
the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Acquiror shall not amend or otherwise
modify the LLC Agreement (except with respect to changes to the LLC Agreement
to reflect the transfer of Acquiror Units or the admission of new members)
without the consent of Contributor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

 

6.19 _Amendment of Existing Registration Rights Agreement_. Prior to the
Closing, Acquiror and Acquiror Parent shall amend (or amend and restate) the
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2014
(the " _Existing Registration Rights Agreement_ "), by and between Acquiror,
Acquiror Parent and the other parties thereto (as amended, the " _A andR
Registration Rights Agreement_") to include the terms set forth on _Exhibit H_
hereto. Subject to the foregoing, Acquiror and Acquiror Parent shall not amend
or otherwise modify the Existing Registration Rights Agreement prior to the
Closing without the consent of Contributor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

6.20  _Execution of Closing Deliverables_. At Closing the Contributor shall
cause the Contributor Representative and the Service Provider (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement), as applicable, to execute and deliver all
items called for to be executed and delivered by such Persons pursuant to,
and in accordance with, _Section 8.2_ of this Agreement (including the
Transition Services Agreement, the Defect Escrow Agreement and the Indemnity
Holdback Escrow Agreement).

8.4 _Adjusted Purchase Price and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments._

 

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Contributor shall prepare and deliver to Acquiror, a draft preliminary
settlement statement (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ ") setting
forth (i) Contributors good faith estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price for
the Company Group Interests as of the Closing Date after giving effect to all
adjustments set forth in _Section 2.2_, (ii) the Persons, accounts, and
amounts of disbursements that Contributor designates and nominates to receive
the cash portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price less: (i) the amount of the
Deposit; (ii) the Defect Escrow Cash Amount and (iii) the Indemnity Holdback
Cash, which shall constitute the dollar amount to be payable by Acquiror to
Contributor at Closing (the " _Cash Closing Payment_ "), along with the
wiring instructions for all such payments and disbursements and (iv) the
Persons (who shall consist only of Persons who own, directly or indirectly
through ownership of Interests in one or more other Persons, Interests in the
Contributor Parties (" _Contributor s Designees_")) and whole number of
Acquiror Units that Contributor designates and nominates to receive the Unit
Purchase Price (each such Person, a " _Unit Recipient_ "), as adjusted by
_Section 2.2_, less the Escrowed Defect Units and the Indemnity Holdback
Units (the " _Stock Closing Payment_ "). Contributor shall supply to Acquiror
reasonable documentation in the possession of the Contributor Group or any of
their Affiliates to support the items for which adjustments are proposed or
made in the Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Contributor and a
reasonably detailed explanation of any such adjustments and the reasons
therefor. Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of Contributors draft
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Acquiror will deliver to Contributor a
written report containing all changes that Acquiror proposes to be made to
the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any, together with a brief
explanation of any such changes. The

 



-71-  Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon in writing by the Parties
(subject to further adjustments under _Section 8.4(b)_, will be used to
adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties
cannot agree on all adjustments set forth in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement prior to the Closing, then any adjustments as set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented by Contributor will be used to
adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than
the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following the Closing Date,
Contributor shall prepare and deliver to Acquiror a draft statement setting
forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and showing the
calculation of each adjustment under _Section 2.2_, based on the most recent
actual figures for each adjustment; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes
of making such final calculation, the adjustment amounts made pursuant to
_Sections 2.2(b)(vi)_ , _2.2(b)(vii)_ and _2.2(b)(viii)_ shall be assumed to
be in the same amounts as the amounts used for such adjustments in calculating
the Adjusted Purchase Price in the Preliminary Settlement Statement.
Contributor shall include in such notice such reasonable documentation as is
in the Contributor Groups possession to support the final figures. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following
receipt of such statement from Contributor, Acquiror shall deliver to
Contributor a written report containing any changes that Acquiror proposes be
made to such statement, and in order to be valid, any such written report by
Acquiror shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and
basis of any changes so asserted. Contributor may deliver a written report to
Acquiror during this same period reflecting any changes that Contributor
proposes to be made to such statement as a result of additional information
received after the statement was prepared. If Acquiror does not deliver such
report to Contributor on or before the end of such thirty (30) day period (or,
if Contributor proposes any changes to such statement, thirty (30) days from
the date Contributor delivers written notice thereof to Acquiror), Acquiror
shall be deemed to have agreed with Contributors statement, and such
statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties. The Parties
shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase
Price no later than ninety (90) days after delivery of Contributors
statement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within such
period of time, any Party may refer the items of adjustment which are in
dispute to the Houston, Texas office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or, if
such Person is not able or willing to serve, a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm or consulting firm mutually acceptable to both
Acquiror and Contributor (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "), for review and
final determination by arbitration. If Acquiror and Contributor have not
agreed upon a mutually acceptable alternate Person to serve as Accounting
Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days of receiving notice of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs unavailability, Contributor shall, within ten
(10) Business Days after the end of such initial ten (10) Business Day
period, formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association to choose the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
_Section 8.4(b)_. The Accounting Arbitrators determination shall be made
within forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In
determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase
Price, the Accounting Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of _Article 2_
and may not increase the Adjusted Purchase Price more than the increase
proposed by Contributor nor decrease the Adjusted Purchase Price more than the

 



-72-  decrease proposed by Acquiror, as applicable. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed aspects of adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Contributor and Acquiror shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. Contributor shall bear one-half and Acquiror shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator.

 

(c) Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as determined pursuant to
_Section 8.4(a)_ and the finally determined Adjusted Purchase Price as
determined pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ shall be paid in cash by the owing
Party to the owed Party within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of (i)
the expiration of Acquirors thirty (30) day review period (including any
extensions provided for above) without delivery of any written report, (ii)
the date on which the Parties agree in writing as to the final Adjusted
Purchase Price, or (c) the date on which the Accounting Arbitrator finally
determines the Adjusted Purchase Price.

(d) Acquiror shall assist Contributor in preparation of the final statement
of the Adjusted Purchase Price under _Section 8.4(b)_ by furnishing
invoices, receipts, and providing reasonable access to personnel and such
other assistance as may be requested by Contributor to facilitate such process
post-Closing.

 

(e) All cash payments made or to be made under _Section 8.4(c)_ to
Contributor (or its designees) or Acquiror shall be made by electronic
transfer of immediately available funds to Contributor (or its designees) or
Acquiror, as applicable, or to such other bank and account as may be specified
by Contributor or Acquiror in writing.

 

(f) Following the adjustments made under _Section 8.4(b)_, no further
adjustments shall be made to the Adjusted Purchase Price but nothing in this
_Section 8.4(f)_ is a limitation on _Schedule 6.13_.

8.5 _Indemnity Holdback._

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall deposit into the Indemnity Holdback
Escrow Account (i) 4,921,557 Acquiror Units (such Acquiror Units, together
with any cash and non-cash dividends, securities and other property at any
time received in exchange or respect of or otherwise in substitution of the
such Indemnity Holdback Units or the shares of Class A Common Stock for
which such Indemnity Holdback Units may be exchanged pursuant to the LLC
Agreement, collectively, the " _Indemnity Holdback Units_ ") and a
corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock and (ii) One Hundred
Seventy-Two Million Two Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Five Hundred Eight
Dollars ($172,254,508) in cash (the " _Indemnity Holdback Cash_ "), for the
purpose of securing the satisfaction and discharge of indemnity claims of the
Acquiror Parties against the Contributor Parties under this Agreement. The
Indemnity Holdback Units (and the corresponding number of shares of Class B
Common Stock) to be deposited into the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account will
be issued in the name of the Unit Recipients, whether in book-entry or
certificated form, with each Unit Recipient being issued such Unit Recipients
Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Holdback Units (and a corresponding number of
shares of Class B Common Stock). For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity
Holdback Units and Indemnity Holdback Cash represent a deduction from, and are
not in

 



-73-  addition to, the Adjusted Purchase Price paid by Acquiror to Contributor on
the Closing Date. The Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account shall be governed by
the provisions of this  _Section 8.5_ and an escrow agreement that the
Acquiror and Contributor Representative shall execute and deliver at Closing
to the Escrow Agent and which shall be in customary form (which the Parties
agree shall provide for the prompt disbursement from the escrow account to
the registered holders of Indemnity Holdback Units any tax distributions made
in respect of such Indemnity Holdback Units pursuant Section 6.2 of the AandR
LLC Agreement) and contain terms and provisions consistent with this _Section
8.5_ (the " _Indemnity Holdback Escrow Agreement_ "); provided, however, that
if such Parties are unable to enter into any such Indemnity Holdback Escrow
Agreement or otherwise deposit the Indemnity Holdback Cash and Indemnity
Holdback Units into the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account, then the Parties
shall provide for and enter into appropriate alternative arrangements to give
effect to the provisions of this  _Section 8.5_. The joint, written
authorization of representatives of the Acquiror and the Contributor
Representative pursuant to the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Agreement shall be
required for the disbursement of any portion of the Indemnity Holdback Units
or the Indemnity Holdback Cash. Each disbursement of Indemnity Holdback Units
pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ and the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Agreement
shall be accompanied by a disbursement of a corresponding number of shares of
Class B Common Stock. Whenever any disbursement of Indemnity Holdback Units is
made, such disbursement shall be comprised of Indemnity Holdback Units
registered in the name of all Unit Recipients, with each Unit Recipient
bearing or receiving, as applicable, its Pro Rata Share of such disbursement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no fractional Acquiror Units
or fractional shares of Common Stock shall be disbursed from the Indemnity
Holdback Escrow Account, and, to the extent that any such fractional security
would be required to be so disbursed but for this sentence, such fractional
security shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number of the
applicable securities.

 

(b) With respect to each claim for indemnification asserted by the Acquiror
Parties against the Contributor Parties pursuant to  _Article 11_ during the
period from and after the Closing Date up to the date that is twenty-four (24)
months following the Closing Date (the " _Holdback Period_ "), upon final
resolution or determination of such an indemnity claim by the Parties or in
accordance with _Section 12.5_, such amount as would satisfy such finally
resolved or determined indemnity claim will be satisfied exclusively from the
Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account and Acquiror and Contributor shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Acquiror Indemnity Holdback Units and
Indemnity Holdback Cash with a total value equal to the amount to be so
disbursed (valuing such Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share Value, pro
rata in the same proportions that the Indemnity Holdback Units (valuing such
Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share Value) bear to the total value
contained in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account at the time of such
disbursement, with the number of Indemnity Holdback Units to be disbursed
determined by valuing such Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share Value.
For the avoidance of doubt, the sole and exclusive recourse of Acquiror
Parties for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the
Contributor Parties pursuant to this Agreement or any other post-Closing
liability of the Contributor Parties pursuant to this Agreement (including any
indemnity obligation), other than any liability arising as a result of actual
(and not constructive) fraud, is limited to disbursements that may be made
from the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account.

 



-74- (c) If, upon the resolution or determination of any such indemnity claim
during the Holdback Period, Acquiror and Contributor fail to deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 8.5(b)_,
then the Escrow Agent shall, upon delivery by Acquiror or Contributor to the
Escrow Agent of a written final, non-appealable court order from a court of
competent jurisdiction, disburse to Acquiror Indemnity Holdback Units and
Indemnity Holdback Cash with a value equal to the amounts set forth in such
court order (valuing such Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share Value for
such purpose), pro rata in the same proportions that the Indemnity Holdback
Units (valuing such Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share Value) bear to
the total value contained in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account at the
time of such disbursement, with the number of Indemnity Holdback Units to be
disbursed determined by valuing such Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share
Value.

 

(d) Acquiror and Contributor shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to Contributor (i) on the first Business Day after the date that is
twelve months following the Closing Date, any Indemnity Holdback Units then-
remaining in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account and any Indemnity Holdback
Cash then-remaining in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Amount having a total
value equal to the total value contained in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow
Account at such time, less (A) an amount equal to 2.5% of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (valuing the Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share Value)
and (B) Indemnity Holdback Units and Indemnity Holdback Cash having a total
value equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding claims for
indemnification which the Acquiror Parties have provided to the Contributor
Parties that have not been previously satisfied (valuing the Indemnity
Holdback Units at the Per Share Value for such purposes) (which Indemnity
Holdback Units and Indemnity Holdback Cash shall remain part of the Indemnity
Holdback Escrow Account until final resolution of such outstanding indemnity
claims (the " _Initial Release Disputed Claims_ "), with such Indemnity
Holdback Cash and Indemnity Holdback Units being disbursed pro rata based on
the proportions that each bear to the total value contained in the
Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account at such time (valuing the Indemnity
Holdback Units at the Per Share Value) and (ii) on the first Business Day
after the expiration of the Holdback Period, any Indemnity Holdback Units and
Indemnity Holdback Cash then-remaining in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow
Account, in each case except for any Indemnity Holdback Units and Indemnity
Holdback Cash retained in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account at such time
in respect of any Initial Release Disputed Claims and Indemnity Holdback
Units and Indemnity Holdback Cash having a total value equal to the aggregate
amount of all outstanding claims for indemnification made subsequent to the
date that is 12 months following the date of this Agreement for which the
Acquiror Parties have provided to the Contributor Parties that have not been
previously satisfied (valuing the Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per Share
Value for such purposes) (which Indemnity Holdback Units and Indemnity
Holdback Cash shall remain part of the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account
until final resolution of such outstanding indemnity claims (the " _Final
Release Disputed Claims_ " and, together with the Initial Release Disputed
Claims, the " _Disputed Claims_ "). Upon final resolution or determination of
any Disputed Claim by the Parties or in accordance with _Section 12.5_,
Acquiror and Contributor shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions to disburse to the Acquiror Indemnity Holdback Units and
Indemnity Holdback Cash having a value equal to the amount so finally
determined to be owed to the Acquiror Parties (valuing such Indemnity Holdback
Units at the Per Share Value), pro rata in the same proportions that the
Indemnity Holdback Units (valuing such Indemnity Holdback Units at the Per
Share Value) bear to the total value contained in the Indemnity

 



-75-  Holdback Escrow Account at the time of such disbursement, with the number of
Indemnity Holdback Units to be disbursed determined by valuing such Indemnity
Holdback Units at the Per Share Value, and all other Indemnity Holdback Units
and Indemnity Holdback Cash remaining in the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account
in respect of such Disputed Claim shall be disbursed to Contributor. If the
Acquiror and Contributor fail to deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow Agent
shall, upon delivery by Acquiror or Contributor to the Escrow Agent of a
written final, non-appealable court order from a court of
competent jurisdiction relating to such Disputed Claim disburse the Indemnity
Holdback Units and Indemnity Holdback Cash in respect of such Disputed Claim
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence.

 

8.6 _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 60
days after the Closing Date, Acquiror Parties shall eliminate Contributors
name, its logo and any variants thereof from the Assets and, except with
respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no
right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Contributor or
any of its Affiliates.

ARTICLE 9

 

TAX MATTERS

9.1  _Straddle Period Tax Proration_. For purposes of determining the
allocations of Taxes imposed on the Company Group, or for which it is
otherwise liable, for any Straddle Period that are attributable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending prior to the Effective Date: (A) Asset Taxes
that are attributable to the severance, production or sale of Hydrocarbons
shall be allocated to the portion of such Straddle Period in which the
severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (B) Taxes
that are (i) Income Taxes, (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)
or (iii) imposed on specific transactions, including payroll taxes, shall be
allocated to the portion of such Straddle Period in which the transaction
giving rise to such Taxes occurred, and (C) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem,
property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period
ending prior to the Effective Date and the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning on or after the Effective Date by prorating each such Asset Tax
based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur
before the Effective Date, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on or after the Effective Date, on the other hand;
provided however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending prior to the
Effective Date and the period beginning on or after the Effective Date in
proportion to the number of days in each period. Regardless of which Party is
responsible, Contributor shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental
Authority of all Taxes which are required to be paid prior to the
Closing Date, and the Company Group shall handle payment to the appropriate
Governmental Authority of all Taxes required to be paid on and after the
Closing Date.

 



-76- 9.2 _Tax Returns_. Contributor shall be responsible for filing with the
applicable taxing authorities each Company Group Tax Return that is required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Return for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Effective
Date, Contributor shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to the Acquiror no
later than ten (10) days before the due date of such Tax Return for Acquirors
comments and approval and shall not file such Tax Return without the
Acquirors consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that the preceding shall not apply to Tax Returns
relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that are required to be filed
contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close of a Tax period, which
shall be provided to Acquiror promptly after filing. Contributor shall timely
file such Tax Return (after incorporating the comments from Acquiror) before
the due date of such Tax Return. Acquiror shall be responsible for filing
with the applicable taxing authorities each Company Group Tax Return that is
required to be filed after the Closing Date.

9.3  _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent that any sales, purchase, transfer,
stamp, documentary stamp, registration, use or similar taxes are payable by
reason of the sale of the Company Group Interests under this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "), such Transfer Taxes shall be borne and timely paid by
Acquiror. Acquiror and Contributor shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes. 

9.4 _Tax Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
imposed on or with respect to the Company Group. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of
records and information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided under this Agreement. Contributor and Acquiror agree to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company Group relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority.

 

9.5 _754 Elections_. Contributor shall, prior to the Closing, cause each Tax
Partnership that is scheduled with respect to  _Section 4.3(j)_ to either
(x) have in effect a valid election under Section 754 of the Code (or similar
provisions of state, local or foreign Law) for any taxable year that includes
the Closing Date or (y) obtain all necessary consents therefor.

9.6 _1031 Like-Kind Exchange Cooperation_. Contributor and Acquiror agree that
either or both of Contributor and Acquiror may elect to treat the acquisition
or sale of the Company Group Interests as an exchange of like-kind property
under section 1031 of the Code (an " _Exchange_ "). Each Party agrees to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in the completion of
such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in
Treasury Regulation section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service
Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Contributor and Acquiror shall have the
right at any time prior to Closing to assign its rights under this Agreement
to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as
that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to
effect an Exchange. In connection with any such Exchange, any exchange
accommodation title holder shall have taken all steps necessary to own the
Company Group Interests under applicable law.

 



-77-  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a Partys
rights under this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any
other person in connection with the Exchange shall release any Party from, or
modify, any of their respective liabilities and obligations (including
indemnity obligations to each other) under this Agreement, and no Party makes
any representations as to any particular tax treatment that may be afforded
to any other Party by reason of such assignment or any other actions taken in
connection with the Exchange. Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or
sale of the Company Group Interests as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay
all additional costs incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in
consideration for the cooperation of the other Parties, the Party electing
Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange
and to indemnify and hold each other Party, its affiliates, and their
respective former, current and future partners, members, shareholders, owners,
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives harmless
from and against any and all liabilities and Taxes arising out of, based
upon, attributable to or resulting from the Exchange or transactions or
actions taken in connection with the Exchange that would not have been
incurred by the other Parties but for the electing Partys Exchange election.

9.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. On or before sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Acquiror shall deliver to Contributor a proposed allocation of
the fair market value of the Company Group (determined based upon the Adjusted
Purchase Price) among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law, as applicable), which shall also be consistent with the
Allocated Values (the " _Proposed Tax Allocation_ "). Contributor shall have
thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Proposed Tax Allocation to
review such Proposed Tax Allocation and if Contributor does not provide
Acquiror with a timely Allocation Objection Notice, the allocations set forth
in the Proposed Tax Allocation shall be deemed agreed upon. If, however,
Contributor objects to the Proposed Tax Allocation, it must provide written
notice of any such objection within the foregoing thirty (30) day period (the
" _Allocation Objection Notice_ "). Subsequent to Acquirors receipt of the
Allocation Objection Notice, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
reach a mutually agreeable allocation. If the Parties do not reach a mutually
agreeable allocation of such fair market value of the Company Group within
thirty (30) days of Acquirors receipt of the Allocation Objection Notice, the
Parties shall submit any disputes as to such allocation to the Accounting
Arbitrator. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to, within
thirty (30) days of its engagement by the Parties, determine the appropriate
allocation and to provide written notice of its determination to the Parties
(such allocation mutually agreed to by the Parties, deemed agreed to by
the Parties, or finally determined by the Accounting Arbitrator, as
applicable, the " _Final Allocation_ "). The Final Allocation schedule shall
be updated to reflect any subsequent adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase
Price. All fees and expenses charged by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to
this _Section 9.7_ will be allocated between the Parties in inverse
proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed
adjustments so submitted (as finally determined by the Accounting Arbitrator)
(or, if such formula is inapplicable, such fees and expenses shall be borne by
the Parties in an equitable manner, as determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator). Acquiror and Contributor agree not to take any position or file
any Tax Return inconsistent with the Final Allocation unless required by
applicable Law or a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1)
of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement will
prevent a Party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of

 



-78-  the Final Allocation, and neither Party will be required to litigate before
any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging the final allocation, as applicable. Each Party shall promptly
notify the others upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audit or assessment challenging the Final Allocation.

 

9.8 _Tax Treatment_.

 

(a) The Contributor Parties intend to treat, for U.S. federal income and
applicable state and local Tax purposes, the Contribution and Liquidations,
taken together, as an "assets-over" partnership merger transaction under
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby DEEP
will be the terminating partnership and Acquiror will be the
resulting partnership.

(b) The Contribution shall be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as
a contribution of the assets and properties of the Company Group Members to
Acquiror in exchange for the Unit Purchase Price and the assumption of any
liabilities that constitute "qualified liabilities" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(a)(6) which is not treated as a transfer
of consideration made pursuant to a sale of the assets to the Acquiror under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(a)(5) in a transaction consistent with the
requirements of Section 721(a) of the Code, to the extent applicable. To the
maximum extent allowed pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d), any
amounts treated as a transfer of cash or other consideration pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(a)(1)) shall be treated as
a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). The sum of (i) cash and other consideration not
treated as reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures and (ii) the
amount of consideration treated as sale proceeds in connection with the
assumption of any liability by Acquiror under Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-5(a)(5) will be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale transaction
described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code. The Parties agree to prepare
and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing
and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return,
or in the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws,
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Governmental Authority.

ARTICLE 10

 

TERMINATION

10.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing: (a) by the mutual prior written consent of the Contributor Parties
and the Acquiror Parties, (b) by either the Contributor Parties or the
Acquiror Parties if the Closing has not occurred on or before 5:00 pm local
time in Houston, Texas on May 19, 2017 (the " _End Date_ ") or (c) by the
Contributor Parties, in the event that prior to 5:00 p.m. local time in
Houston, Texas on the date two (2) Business Days after the Execution Date
Purchaser fails to fund into escrow with the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_ the entirety of the Deposit; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no Party
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement under _Section 10.1(b)_ if the
Closing has failed to occur as a result of such Partys breach of any
representations or warranties set forth herein or such Partys failure to
perform or observe such Partys covenants and agreements hereunder

 



-79-  (including the failure to perform the obligations of such Party with respect
to Closing the transactions contemplated hereunder if and when required) in
each case in a manner that causes the conditions of the other Party in
_Article 7_ not to be satisfied (a " _Material Breach_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Closing has not occurred or this Agreement has not
otherwise been terminated by the date that is 30 days following the End Date
and the Acquiror Parties have not initiated any action for specific
performance of the Contributor Parties obligations to consummate the
Transactions (or at any time after such an action has been initiated, the
Acquiror Parties fail to use reasonable best efforts to pursue such action),
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _clause (b)_ of this
_Section 10.1_, the Contributor Parties shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement by delivering written notice to the Acquiror Parties.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or
effect (except for the provisions of _Section 1.2_, this _Article 10_,
_Sections 4.8_, _5.11_ , _6.2, 6.4_ , and _Article 12_ (other than _Section
12.17_, all of which shall continue in full force and effect).

10.3  _Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination; Damages for Failure to
Close_.

(a) In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Acquiror Parties set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived in
writing by Acquiror Parties (except for those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at Closing, all of which the Contributor Parties stand
ready, willing and able to satisfy) and (ii) the Contributor Parties are
entitled to terminate this Agreement under _Section 10.1(b)_ because the
conditions precedent to the obligations of Contributor set forth in _Section
7.1_ are not satisfied as of the date set forth in _Section 10.1(b)_ solely
as a result of the breach or failure of Acquiror Parties representations,
warranties, or covenants hereunder, including, if and when required, Acquiror
Parties obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at
Closing, then Contributor shall be entitled to elect, in its sole discretion,
to either (x) seek specific performance of this Agreement, or (y) to
terminate this Agreement and receive the entirety of the Deposit, together
with an amount in cash equal to an additional five percent (5%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price, (the " _Liquidated Damages Payment_ "
and, together with the Deposit, the " _Liquidated Damages Amount_ ") for the
sole account and use of Contributor as liquidated damages and as its sole
remedy hereunder. If Contributor terminates this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 10.1(c)_, Acquiror shall promptly pay to Contributor an amount in
cash equal to ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (a " _Deposit
Damages Payment_ "). Contributor and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that (A)
Contributors actual damages upon the event of a termination described in this
Section 10.3(a) are difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (B) the
Liquidated Damages Amount (and the amount of the payment described in the
immediately preceding sentence) is a fair and reasonable estimate by the
Parties of such aggregate actual damages of Contributor, and (C) such
liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty. Upon the occurrence of a
termination by Contributor pursuant to this _Section 10.3(a)_, Contributor
and Acquiror shall, as applicable, either (a) execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit together with
any income thereon to Contributor, and Acquiror shall pay to Contributor in
cash the Liquidated Damages Payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account or accounts to be designated in writing by Contributor
or (b) pay to Contributor in cash the Deposit Damages Payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts to be
designated in writing by Contributor.

 



-80- (b) In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Contributor set forth in _Section 7.1_ have been satisfied or waived in
writing by Contributor (except for those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at Closing, all of which Acquiror Parties stand ready, willing
and able to satisfy) and (ii) Acquiror Parties are entitled to terminate this
Agreement under _Section 10.1(b)_ because the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Acquiror Parties set forth in _Section 7.2_ are not satisfied
as of the date set forth in _Section 10.1(b)_ solely as a result of the
breach or failure of Contributors representations, warranties, or covenants
hereunder, including, if and when required, Contributors obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing, then Acquiror
shall be entitled to elect, in its sole discretion, to either (A) seek
specific performance of this Agreement, or (B) terminate this Agreement, in
which event Acquiror shall be entitled to (x) receive the entirety of the
Deposit for the sole account and use of Acquiror Parties and (y) seek Damages
available to Acquiror at Law or in equity up to an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and in the case of _clause (B)_ ,
Contributor and Acquiror shall execute and deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit together with any income thereon
to Acquiror.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reasons set
forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ or  _Section 10.3(b)_, Acquiror shall be
entitled to receive the Deposit, free of any claims by Contributor or any
other Person with respect thereto. In such event, Contributor and Acquiror
shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Deposit together with any income thereon to Acquiror.

INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEE, OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, and further excepting in each case
Damages against which Acquiror would be required to indemnify Contributor
under _Section 11.1(a)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, the Contributor Parties and the Acquiror Parties sole
and exclusive remedy against each other with respect to breaches of the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the Parties
contained in _Article 4_, _Article 5_,  _Article 6_ (excluding _Sections
6.2_ and _6.9_ , which shall be separately enforceable by the Parties pursuant
to whatever rights and remedies are available to them outside of this _Article
11_, but which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to the last
sentence of _Section 8.5(b)_), and the affirmations of such representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in the certificates delivered
by each Party at Closing pursuant to _Sections 8.2(c)_ and _8.3(f)_ , as
applicable, is set forth in this _Section 11.1_.

(d) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to
this _Article 11_ as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, except as
otherwise required under applicable Law.

 

11.2 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under _Section
11.1_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this _Article 11_, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ "
when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having
an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such
Damages pursuant to this _Article 11_, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ "
when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this
_Article 11_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified
in _Section 11.2(h)_). 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 11.1_, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
" _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a " _Claim"_
), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a
complete copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim;
provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim
as provided in this _Section 11.2_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person
of its obligations under _Section 11.1_, except to the extent such failure
results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person
to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnifying Persons ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached and the reasonably specific details of, and specific
basis for, such asserted inaccuracy or breach.

 



-83- (c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
_Article 11_. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified
Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying
Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it
shall be deemed to have denied its obligation to provide such indemnification
hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this
_Section 11.2(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Person
shall not have the right to defend any Claim relating to Taxes for which the
Indemnifying Person does not have sole liability. Such Claims shall be
defended jointly by the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person. An
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto that (i) does not result in a final, non-appealable, resolution of
the Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Claim (including, in
the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified
Person from all further liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii)
may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person
is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final, non-appealable
determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for
indemnification with respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so
admitted, assume the defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the
proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the
objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely
admitted its obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense
of the Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right
to indemnity therefor.

 



-84- (f) If a Party would be required to defend a Claim as provided in this
_Section 11.2_, which Claim is unliquidated in amount, but for the assertion
that the other Party would not be entitled to indemnification for any
liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, judgment, or other Damages
incurred or suffered by such Party due solely to the limitations set forth in
_Section 11.3(c)_ with respect to the amount of such Claim, such Party shall
nevertheless have the right and obligation to defend against such Claim as set
forth in _Section 11.2(d)_, subject to the indemnification obligations of
such Party set forth in this _Article 11_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
upon final, non-appealable liquidation of the amount of such Claim, the Party
defending such Claim pursuant to this  _Section 11.2(f)_ would not have had
the obligation to defend such Claim under _Section 11.3(c)_ due solely to the
limitations set forth in _Section 11.3(c)_ with respect to the amount of such
Claim, the Party defending such Claim shall be entitled to reimbursement of
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred with respect to the defense of such
Claim.

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed to have disputed the claim for
indemnification hereunder.

 

(h) Any claim for indemnity under _Section 11.1_ by any Affiliate, director,
officer, employee or agent must be brought and administered by the applicable
Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than Contributor and
Acquiror shall have any rights against either Contributor or Acquiror under
the terms of _Section 11.1_ except as may be exercised on its behalf by
Acquiror or Contributor, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 11.2(h)_.
Each of Contributor and Acquiror may elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under this _Section 11.2_ on behalf of the other
Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have
no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction
under this _Section 11.2_.

 

11.3 _Limitation on Actions_.

 

(a) The Acquiror Party Fundamental Representations, Contributor Group
Fundamental Representations, the Special Warranty of Title, the covenants of
the Contributor Parties in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to
Closing, and the corresponding representations, warranties, and affirmations
given in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to _Sections 8.2(c)_
and  _8.3(f)_ , shall terminate upon the expiration of the Holdback Period.
All other representations and warranties of the Contributor Parties in this
Agreement, and the corresponding representations, warranties, and affirmations
given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to _Sections 8.2(c)_
and _8.3(f)_ , shall terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date. The representations and warranties of Acquiror Parties in 
_Article 5_ (excluding the Acquiror Party Fundamental Representations) and
the covenants of the Acquiror Parties in this Agreement to be performed at or
prior to Closing, and

 



-85-  the corresponding representations, warranties, and affirmations given in the
certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to _Sections 8.2(c)_ and _8.3(f)_ ,
shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months. The covenants
and agreements of the Parties to be performed after Closing shall survive
Closing as reasonably necessary to perform the same, subject to _Section 8.5_
and the limitations set forth in this _Section 11.3_. Representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements shall be of no further force and effect
after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no
termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement prior to
its expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in _Sections 11.1(a)(i)_, _11.1(a)(ii)_ , _11.1(b)(ii)_
and _11.1(b)(iii)_ shall terminate as of the termination date of each
respective representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on
or before such termination date. The indemnities in _Section 11.1(b)(i)_
shall terminate as of expiration of the Holdback Period.

(c) No Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under _Section
11.1(a)(ii)_ or  _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_, as applicable, for an individual
matter until and unless the amount of the liability for Damages with respect
to which such Party admits (or it is otherwise finally determined) that such
Party has an obligation to indemnify the other Party pursuant to the terms of
_Section 11.1_ exceeds Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) (the "
_Individual Indemnity Threshold_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, no Party
shall have any liability for any indemnification under _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_
or _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_, as applicable, until and unless the aggregate
amount of the liability for all Damages (i) for which Claim Notices are
delivered by the other Party, (ii) with respect to which such Party admits
(or it is otherwise finally determined) that such Party has an obligation to
indemnify the other Party pursuant to the terms of _Article 11_, and (iii)
which exceed the Individual Indemnity Threshold exceeds two percent (2.0%) of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed
two percent (2.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this  _Section 11.3(c)_ shall not limit indemnification for breaches of
the Contributor Party Fundamental Representations, breaches of the Special
Warranty of Title, breaches of the representations and warranties in _Section
4.3_, and the Acquiror Party Fundamental Representations; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, for the purposes of this _Article 11_, any representation,
warranty, or covenant set forth in this Agreement which is qualified by
materiality, Company Group Material Adverse Effect or Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect shall be deemed not to be so qualified.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, other than in respect of any Damages resulting from actual fraud
(and not on any theory of constructive fraud) by the Contributor Parties, the
Contributor Parties shall not be required to indemnify Acquiror under this
_Article 11_ for Damages other than through disbursement of the Indemnity
Holdback Units and the Indemnity Holdback Cash pursuant to _Section 8.5_.

 

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this _Article 11_ shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the
proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified
Person or its Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be
required to seek recovery under any policy of insurance as a condition to
indemnification hereunder.

 



-86- (f) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Damages_ " means the amount of any
actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, or judgment incurred or
suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the
indemnified matter or any breach of this Agreement, whether attributable to
personal injury or death, property damage, contract claims, torts, or
otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants,
accountants, or other agents and experts reasonably incident to matters
indemnified against, and the costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such
matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Acquiror Parties nor the Contributor Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification under this _Article 11_ for, and Damages shall
not include, (i) consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by the
Party claiming indemnification (other than consequential, special, or punitive
damages suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is allocated among
the Parties), and (ii) any increase in liability, loss, cost, expense, claim,
award or judgment to the extent such increase is caused by the actions or
omissions of any Indemnified Person after the Closing Date.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a
claim for indemnity may be made by a Party under this  _Article 11_ in
respect of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
this Agreement despite the fact that such Party obtained knowledge prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or prior to the Closing of the
breach of such representation, warranty or covenant. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of Acquiror Parties and Contributor Parties are entitled to
rely upon, and shall be deemed to have relied upon, all representations,
warranties and covenants of the other Party set forth in this Agreement which
are made in favor of Acquiror Parties or Contributor, as applicable, and the
rights of the members of Acquiror Family and Contributor Family who are
entitled to indemnification under this _Article 11_ shall not be affected,
notwithstanding (i) the making of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation or
examination conducted by or on behalf of a Party with respect thereto, or
(iii) the Closing hereunder.

Either Party may change its address for notice by notice to the other in the
manner set forth above. All notices shall be deemed to have been duly given
at the time of receipt by the Party to which such notice is addressed.

12.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all expenses
incurred by the Contributor Parties in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the
Closing, including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and financial
advisers employed by the Contributor Parties, shall be borne solely and
entirely by the Contributor Parties, and all such expenses incurred by
Acquiror Parties shall be borne solely and entirely by Acquiror Parties.

12.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws that would
direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 

12.5 _Dispute Resolution_. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any
action brought in the United States federal courts located in the State of
Texas with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in
relation to or in connection with this Agreement, and each of the Parties
agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect to any
such dispute, controversy or claim (except to the extent a dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to or in connection with
title matters pursuant to _Section 3.10_, or the determination of
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ is
referred to an expert pursuant to those Sections) will be instituted
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Texas. Each Party (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts, (b) waives any objection to laying venue in any such

 



-89-  action or proceeding in such courts, (c) waives any objection that such
courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over it, and (d)
agrees that service of process upon it may be effected by mailing a copy
thereof by registered mail (or any substantially similar form of mail),
postage prepaid, to it at its address specified in _Section 12.2_. The
foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service of process shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Texas for
any purpose except as provided herein and shall not be deemed to confer any
rights on any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement. THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT
BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER IN ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN
RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHER, NOTHING HEREIN
SHALL DIVEST A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION OF THE RIGHT AND POWER TO
GRANT A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, TO GRANT TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR
TO COMPEL SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF ANY DECISION OF AN ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL MADE
PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION.

 

12.6 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

12.7 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to
whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent
to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

12.8 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or any
part of this Agreement to any third Person other than an Affiliate, nor shall
any Party delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder (including by change
of control, merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) to any third Person
other than an Affiliate, without the prior written consent of the other Party
and any transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be void.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror may, by providing written notice to
Contributor, but without Contributors consent, assign its rights and delegate
its duties hereunder in whole (but not in part) to an Affiliate of Acquiror;
provided, however, such assignment shall not be permitted if it would
reasonably be anticipated to increase the liability of any Contributing Group
Member with respect to Taxes.

 

12.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents to be executed
hereunder and the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof,
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and
discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject
matter hereof. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied on
any statement, representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other
Party or its representatives other than those expressly contained in this
Agreement.

 



-90- 12.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by the Contributor Parties and the Acquiror
Parties and expressly identified as an amendment or modification.

12.11  _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any Person other than the Acquiror Parties and the Contributor Parties
to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights
expressly provided to the Persons described in _Section 6.4_, _Section 9.6_
and _Section 11.2(h)_.

12.12  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and, to
the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed deleted
from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein (and any other application of such provision) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

 

12.13 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action
is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to
be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day),
then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the
expiration of such period during which notice is required to be given or
action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

 

12.14 _References_. In this Agreement: (a) references to any gender includes a
reference to all other genders; (b) references to the singular includes the
plural, and vice versa; (c) reference to any Article or Section means an
Article or Section of this Agreement; (d) reference to any Exhibit or Schedule
means an Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement, all of which are incorporated

contrary, "hereunder", "hereof", "herein" and words of similar import are
references to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or
other provision of this Agreement; (f) references to "$" or "dollars" means
United States Dollars; (g) "include" and "including" mean include
or including without limiting the generality of the description preceding
such term; and (h) reference to " _Exhibit A_" means _Exhibit A-1_ through

12.15 _Construction_. Acquiror is capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Company Group Interests as a prudent
purchaser would deem appropriate under the circumstances, including with
respect to all matters relating to the Company Group Interests, their value,
operation and suitability. Contributor and Acquiror Parties have had
the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated hereby. This
Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from equal bargaining
positions. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement shall not be construed
against any Party, and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on
the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision thereof.

 



-91- 12.16 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, none of the Acquiror Parties, the Contributor Parties, or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to consequential,
special, or punitive damages in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than consequential, special, or
punitive damages suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is
allocated between the Parties in this Agreement) and each of the Acquiror
Parties and the Contributor Parties, for itself and on behalf of
its Affiliates, hereby expressly waives any right to consequential, special,
or punitive damages in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than consequential, special, or punitive damages
suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is allocated between the
Parties in this Agreement).

12.17 _Contributor Representative_.

 

(a) The Contributor Representative is hereby designated and appointed, and the
Contributor Representative hereby agrees to serve, as agent and attorney-in-
fact, following the Closing and the Liquidations, for each member of DEEP and
their successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Members_ " and each, a "
_Member_ ", and together with Contributor, the " _Represented Persons_ "),
with full power and authority to take any and all actions that the Contributor
Representative believes are necessary or appropriate to consummate the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, following the Closing and the
Liquidations, for and on behalf of the Represented Persons as fully as if each
Represented Person was acting on its own behalf, including (without
limitation) full power and authority on such Represented Persons behalf
to: (i) establish a segregated bank account (the " _Member Fund_ ") to hold
an amount of cash equal to (A) five percent (5%) of the cash portion of the
Adjusted Purchase Price as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
as agreed by the Parties pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ (the " _Cash Reserve_
") to purchase New Purchased Leases and New Wells (including any costs or
expenses related thereto), _plus_ (B) $500,000 (the " _Contributor Rep
Expense Fund_ ") to cover and reimburse reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by the Contributor Representative for its obligations in
connection with this Agreement, which amounts shall be set aside
by Contributor from the Cash Closing Payment received by Contributor pursuant
to _Section 8.3(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that the
amount of cash in the Contributor Rep Expense Fund is insufficient to cover
any out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Contributor
Representative pursuant to _Schedule 6.13_ , the Contributor Representative
may use cash in the Cash Reserve to satisfy any such shortfall; (ii) following
the Closing, deposit the Cash Reserve and the Contributor Rep Expense Fund in
the Member Fund; (iii) negotiate, defend, dispute, contest, assert, compromise
and settle all claims and matters arising under this Agreement following the
Closing; (iv) interpret all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
each other Transaction Agreement (other than the Registration Rights and Lock-
Up Agreement and the LLC Agreement) and negotiate, consent to, execute and
deliver any amendment, waiver or consent of or under this Agreement, the
Defect Escrow Agreement and the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Agreement following
the Closing; (v) authorize, negotiate, compromise, settle, agree to and
otherwise handle any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under this
Agreement; (vi) use all or any portion of the Cash Reserve to fund any
transactions (and any costs or expenses related thereto) contemplated by
_Schedule 6.13_ in accordance with the terms thereof; (vii) use the Member
Fund as a source of reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses and other obligations of, or incurred by, the Contributor
Representative in connection with the exercise by the Contributor
Representative of 

 



-92-  its respective rights or the performance of its duties under this Agreement;
(viii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with judgments of courts or other Governmental Authorities and awards
of arbitrators with respect to any claims for indemnification by or against
any member of Acquiror Group, in each case, relating to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement (other than the Registration Rights and Lock-Up
Agreement and the LLC Agreement); (ix) agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and comply with judgments of courts or other
Governmental Authorities and awards of arbitrators with respect to any claims
arising out of or relating to Title Defects under this Agreement following the
Closing; (x) make, execute, and deliver all other contracts, orders, receipts,
notices, requests, instructions, certificates, letters and other writings as
the Contributor Representative may deem necessary and proper in connection
with Contributors obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement (other than the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement and the
LLC Agreement) following the Closing, or to effect any of the foregoing; (xi)
disburse the Cash Reserve, the Contributor Rep Expense Fund, the Escrowed
Defect Units and the Indemnity Holdback Units to the Represented Persons in
accordance with the terms of that certain Member Representative Agreement by
and among Contributor Representative and the Members; (xii) give and receive
notices and communications to accept service of process on behalf of the
Represented Persons pursuant to  _Section 12.5_; (xiii) take such actions
and make such filings as the Contributor Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the Liquidations of each of Contributor, Member
LLC and DEEP; (xiv) take any and all other actions specified or contemplated
by this Agreement following the Closing, and to engage counsel, accountants or
other agents in connection with the foregoing matters; and (xv) take all
actions following the Closing that are either (A) necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Contributor Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or (B) specifically mandated by this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or in furtherance of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Contributor Representative (acting as such) shall not take any action or enter
into any agreements or settlements that would (x) disproportionately affect
any Represented Person in relation to any other Represented Person that had
been a Series A Member of DEEP or (y) result in any liability to a Represented
Person other than liabilities to be satisfied out of the Member Fund, the
Defect Escrow Account and the Indemnity Holdback Escrow Account without the
prior consent of such Represented Person. Notices or communications to or from
the Contributor Representative shall constitute notice to or from
the Represented Persons for all purposes under this Agreement except where
the context otherwise requires. The Contributor Representative shall provide
notices or communications received by it on behalf of the Represented Persons
promptly and in any case no more than three (3) Business Days after receipt.
In addition, the Parties, the Contributor Representative and the Members
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, the Contributor
Representative shall assume the obligation to perform all covenants of the
Contributor under this Agreement, the Defect Escrow Agreement and the
Indemnity Holdback Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
acknowledge that all limitations of liability applicable to the Contributor,
including _Section 8.5(b)_ and _Section 11.3_, shall also apply to the
Contributor Representative and the Contributor Representative shall bear no
greater liability than Contributor under this Agreement.

 

(b) With the prior written consent of (a) one member of the VEP Group (as
defined in the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company
Agreement of DEEP, dated as of November 7, 2016 (the " _DEEP LLC Agreement_
"), and (b) one member of the

 



-93-  Magnetar Group (as defined in the DEEP LLC Agreement), the Contributor
Representative may delegate its authority as Contributor Representative to any
one of the Members for a fixed or indeterminate period of time upon not fewer
than ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to Acquiror in accordance
with _Section 12.2_ and delivery to Acquiror of a written agreement of such
successor Contributor Representative to be bound by the terms of this
_Section 12.17_. Each successor Contributor Representative has all of the
power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Contributor Representative, and the term "Contributor
Representative" as used in this Agreement includes any successor Contributor
Representative.

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Contributor Representative
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement constitutes a decision, act,
consent or instruction, as applicable, of the Represented Persons (except
where the context otherwise requires or the consent of the Represented
Persons is required and has not been obtained) and is final, binding and
conclusive upon the Represented Persons, and any Person dealing with the
Contributor Representative is entitled to rely on such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Contributor Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Represented Persons.

 

(d) This appointment and grant of power and authority by the Represented
Persons to the Contributor Representative pursuant to this  _Section 12.17_
is coupled with an interest, is in consideration of the mutual covenants made
in this Agreement, is irrevocable and may not be terminated by the act of any
Member or by operation of Laws, whether upon the death or incapacity of any
Member, or by the occurrence of any other event.

(e) In the event that the Service Provider (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement) is an entity that is not a controlled Affiliate of John
Sellers or Cody Campbell, either individually or collectively, the Contributor
Representative shall cause the Service Provider to be subject to the
restrictions set forth in Sections 2 and 3 of the Covenant Agreement, dated
as of the date hereof, by and among Parsley Energy, LLC and the "Executives"
listed as parties thereto (the " _Covenant Agreement_ "), in accordance with
the terms thereof, as though the Service Provider were an "Executive" for
purposes of those sections; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Covenant Agreement, the
foregoing shall not apply to any activity or action by (i) Apollo Natural
Resources Partners, L.P. (" _ANRP I_ "), (ii) Apollo Natural Resources
Partners II, L.P. (" _ANRP II_ "), (iii) any affiliate of ANRP I or ANRP II,
or (iv) any portfolio company owned, operated, managed or controlled by any
of the foregoing.

12.18 _Recourse Only Against Parties_. All claims, obligations, liabilities,
or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and are expressly limited to)
the entities that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this
Agreement or any successor or permitted assign of any such Parties ("
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
without limitation any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any 

 



-94-  Contracting Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (" _Nonparty
Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, each Contracting
Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of
action, and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting
the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by law, (a) each Contracting
Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or
causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or
granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting
Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any Nonparty
Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency,
control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise;
and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty
Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement.

 



-95- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by each of the Parties as
of the date first above written.
