the Company and Inflection. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Purchase Agreement; should not be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk between
the parties; have in some cases been qualified by disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the Purchase Agreement, which disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the Purchase Agreement; may apply
standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be material to investors; and were made only as of the date of the Purchase Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Purchase Agreement and are subject to more
recent developments. Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the Purchase Agreement and, in light of the foregoing reasons, should not rely on the representations and warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of the Company. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:96px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT </B></FONT></P>
