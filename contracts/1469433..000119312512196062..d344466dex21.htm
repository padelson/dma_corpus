Exhibit 2.1

EXECUTION VERSION

The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties made by the
Company and Inflection. These representations and warranties have been made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the Purchase Agreement; should not be
treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating
risk between the parties; have in some cases been qualified by disclosures
that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the
Purchase Agreement, which disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the
Purchase Agreement; may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
different from what may be material to investors; and were made only as of the
date of the Purchase Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified
in the Purchase Agreement and are subject to more recent developments.
Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the Purchase Agreement and,
in light of the foregoing reasons, should not rely on the representations and
warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of
the actual state of facts or conditions of the Company.

as an agreement to assign any Seller Contract, Right or other Purchased Asset
that by its terms or pursuant to Applicable Law is not capable of being sold,
assigned, transferred or delivered without the consent or waiver of a third
party or Governmental Authority unless and until such consent or waiver shall
be given. The Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (but shall
not be required to make payments to such third party or Governmental
Authority), and the Buyer shall cooperate reasonably with the Seller, to
obtain such consents and waivers and to resolve the impediments to the sale,
assignment, transfer or delivery contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and to obtain any other consents and waivers necessary to
convey to the Buyer all of the Purchased Assets. In the event any such
consents or waivers are not obtained prior to the Closing Date, to the extent
it is reasonably likely that such consent or waiver can be obtained using
commercially reasonable efforts, the Seller shall continue to use its
commercially reasonable efforts (but shall not be required to make payments to
such third party or Governmental Authority) to obtain the relevant consents
or waivers until such consents or waivers are obtained, and the Seller will
cooperate with the Buyer in any lawful and economically feasible arrangement
to provide that the Buyer shall receive the interest of the Seller in the
benefits under any such Seller Contract, Right or other Purchased Asset;
_provided_ , that the Buyer shall undertake to pay or satisfy the
corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent the
Buyer would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such consents or
waivers had been obtained. Nothing in this Section 2.5(a) shall affect the
BuyerÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement under Section 9.1 in the event that
any consent or waiver as described herein is not obtained.

 



13 (b) From time to time, whether before, at or following the Closing,
the Seller and the Buyer shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further conveyances, notices, assumptions and releases and such other
instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be necessary or
appropriate to assure fully to the Buyer all of the properties, rights,
titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be
conveyed to the Buyer under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to
assure fully to the Seller the assumption of the liabilities and obligations
intended to be assumed by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and to otherwise make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

Section 2.6 _Consideration_. In full consideration for the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer, at
the Closing, the Buyer shall (a) pay to the Seller, by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by the Seller to the Buyer at least two Business

_Purchase Price_ "), less the Indemnity Escrow Amount, in immediately
available funds in United States dollars, (b) deposit the Indemnity Escrow
Amount by wire transfer in a separate account with the Escrow Agent, to be
managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and (c) assume the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 2.7 _Tax Allocation_.

(a) For all Tax purposes, within 120 days following the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price (plus any Assumed
Liabilities that are treated as consideration for the Purchased Assets for
federal income tax purposes) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
and for applicable Transfer Tax purposes which shall be submitted to the
Seller for review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed (such amount as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.7(a), the " _Price Allocation_ " ). If the Seller agrees in
writing with the Price Allocation or fails to object in writing to the Price
Allocation within 10 days following receipt thereof from the Buyer, the Price
Allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the Seller for
all Tax purposes. If the parties are unable to agree on the Price Allocation
after good faith consultation, the matters in dispute shall be referred for
resolution to a mutually agreeable, nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm, which shall be selected mutually by the Buyer and the Seller
(the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), that is not then providing Tax
advice to the Buyer or the Seller or their respective Affiliates, which
expense shall be borne equally by the parties. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall resolve any disputed matters as promptly as practicable, and the
Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s decision with respect to any such matter shall
be conclusive and binding on the Buyer and the Seller and their respective
Affiliates for applicable Tax purposes. If the Independent Accounting Firm is
unable to resolve any such matter prior to the due date (including extensions,
which will be sought as necessary) for filing any Tax Return reflecting any
such matter, then Buyer may timely file its Tax Return (including Form 8594)
on the basis of the Price Allocation proposed by the Buyer and the Seller may
timely file its Tax Return (including Form 8594) on the basis of the Price
Allocation that the Seller proposed to the Buyer in lieu of the BuyerÂ’s Price
Allocation. Such Tax Returns shall be amended as necessary to reflect the
Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s decision.

 



14 (b) Each party agrees to timely file any form required to be filed
by Applicable Law reflecting the Price Allocation (including IRS form 8594).
The Price Allocation made pursuant to this Section shall be binding on the
Buyer and the Seller for all Tax reporting purposes. Neither the Buyer nor the
Seller shall take any position inconsistent with the Price Allocation in
connection with any Tax proceeding. If any Governmental Authority disputes the
Price Allocation, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly
notify the other party hereto, and the parties shall cooperate in good faith
in responding to such dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the
Price Allocation.

(c) Any payment treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section
8.9 hereof shall be reflected as an adjustment to the price allocated to the
specific asset, if any, giving rise to the adjustment, and if any such
adjustment does not relate to a specific asset such adjustment shall be
allocated among the Purchased Assets as acceptable to both the Buyer and the
Seller.

 

Section 2.8 _Closing_.

(a) The sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a

true and correct (without regard to any qualification as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect) both when made and as of the Closing Date (or, in the
case of any representations and warranties that are made as of a specified
date, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct only as
of such specified date without regard to any qualification as to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect as of such specified date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The
representations and warranties of the Seller in Section 3.2 relating to
authority shall be true and correct in all material respects both when made
and as of the Closing Date (without regard to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect). The Seller shall have performed in
all material respects all obligations and agreements and complied in all
material respects with all covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to or at the Closing.

 



43 (b) _Svitla Agreement Amendment_. The Svitla Agreement, as amended by the
Svitla Agreement Amendment, shall be in full force and effect at the Closing.

(c) _No Litigation_. No Action by a Governmental Authority shall have been
commenced and remain pending that is reasonably likely to be successful and,
if successful, to (i) require the divestiture, sale or licensing of any
significant assets of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) require the
divestiture, sale or licensing of any significant portion of the Business or
the Purchased Assets, or (iii) significantly limit the BuyerÂ’s freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to own and operate, the Business or
the Purchased Assets.

(d) _Deliveries_. The Buyer shall have received an executed copy of each of
the documents listed in Section 2.8(b).

(e) _Audited Financial Statements of the Business_. The Buyer shall have
received a copy from the Seller of the audited balance sheet, income statement
and statement of cash flows of the Business for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2011.

 

(f) _Genealogy Archives Trademark_. The Seller shall have filed any and all
name change or other documents, filings, or other registrations to cause the
Genealogy Archives trademark chain of title to reflect the SellerÂ’s ownership
interest therein.

(g) _Key Employees_. If two or more of the Key Employees shall have revoked,
rescinded, or otherwise withdrawn his or her acceptance of the BuyerÂ’s offer
letters, the Seller in good faith shall identify (in consultation with the
Buyer) an employee or employees of the Seller of at least equivalent
experience and skills in all material respects to which an offer letter of the
Buyer may be extended, at the BuyerÂ’s sole discretion. If the Buyer chooses
to extend an offer, and the terms of such offer are reasonably appropriate for
the level of experience and skills of such employee ( _provided_ that such
terms with respect to compensation shall be at least substantially similar to
such employeeÂ’s current compensation), and the offer is not accepted by such
employee, then Seller in good faith shall identify again (in consultation with
the Buyer) a different employee according to the process set forth above. Any
employee who accepts such a replacement offer shall be deemed a Key Employee.
Unless the Buyer has chosen not to extend an offer to an employee identified
by the Seller in accordance with the process described above, then
there shall be a minimum of two Key Employees with effective offer letters at
the Closing.

 



44 (h) _No Material Adverse Effect_. There shall not have occurred any Material
Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties of the Seller and the Buyer contained in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and any schedule, certificate or other document delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall survive the Closing until 18 months
following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that:

(a) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 relating to
authority and Section 3.4(a) relating to the Purchased Assets (Sections 3.2
and 3.4(a) are collectively referred to herein as the " _Fundamental
Representations_ "), and any representation in the case of fraud with intent
to deceive or willful misrepresentation by the Seller or the Buyer shall
survive until the close of business on the expiration date of the applicable
statute of limitation;

(b) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12 relating to
Taxes shall survive until the close of business on the expiration date of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in
question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) ("
_Tax Representation_ "); and

(c) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.10 relating to
Intellectual Property shall survive until the second anniversary of the
Closing Date (" _IP Representation_ ").

The Seller nor the Buyer shall not have any liability whatsoever with respect
to any such representations and warranties unless a claim is made hereunder
prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representation and
warranty, in which case such representation and warranty shall survive solely
as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. It is the express
intent of the parties that, if the applicable survival period for an item as
contemplated by this Section 8.1 is shorter than the statute of limitation
that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced
to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby. The parties further
acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section 8.1 for the
assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of armsÂ’-length
negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be
enforced as agreed by the parties.

 



45 Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. The Seller shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and the Representatives, of the Buyer
(the " _Buyer Â’s Indemnitees_") from and against any and all losses, damages,
liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, costs and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the
foregoing), but excluding any consequential damages (hereinafter
collectively, " _Losses_ "), asserted against, incurred, sustained or
suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees as a result of, arising out of or relating
to:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto; and

 

(c) any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability.

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. The Buyer shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller and its Representatives (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses asserted against,
incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the Seller Indemnitees as a result
of, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer contained
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Buyer contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto; and

 

(c) any Assumed Liabilities.

Section 8.4 _Procedures_.

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnity or a Seller Indemnity (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or
demand made by any person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice to the party against
whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with reasonable
promptness after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third Party Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure.

 



46 (b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result
from a Third Party Claim that is exclusively for civil monetary damages at law
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt
of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party
Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party
(which expenses shall not be applied against any indemnity limitation herein)
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable
or injunctive relief or any claim that would impose criminal liability or
damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has failed to assume the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does
not expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within
the time period and otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this
Section 8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the
defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have
been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the
named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by counsel to the
Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party
may present such counsel with a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
PartyÂ’s possession or under the Indemnified PartyÂ’s control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter
into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or
judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Representatives, (ii) does not include an
unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified
Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, or (iii)
imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other
than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will
be indemnified hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to control any claim relating to Taxes of the
Indemnified Party for any period ending after the Closing Date _provided_
that, in the case of any Straddle Period for which a claim could result in an
obligation of the Seller to indemnify for Taxes under this Agreement, the
Buyer shall not be entitled to settle such claim without the prior written
consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld), and the Indemnified
Party shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect
the liability of the Indemnified Party for Taxes for any period after the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, enter into any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a
finding or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnifying Party or any of its
Representatives, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnifying Party from all liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim, or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any
obligation, unless the Indemnified Party agrees in writing to release the
Indemnifying Party from all liability and obligation with respect thereto and
waive its right for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to
Article VIII in connection thereto.

 



47 (c) In the event that any Indemnified Party should have a claim against
any Indemnifying Party hereunder (whether or not involves a Third Party
Claim), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice (as defined in the
Escrow Agreement) with respect to such claim with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow
Agreement (to the extent there are any funds available in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) or _Schedule D_ of this Agreement (to the extent there are no available
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the nature of the claim is such that
is not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.5(a) and is not
limited to the funds available in the Indemnity Escrow Fund). The failure to
provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

(d) If either the Seller or the Buyer fails to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee
or any Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, for any Losses to which such Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee in entitled pursuant to this Article VIII
(following compliance with the procedures set forth herein), then such Losses
shall accrue interest from the date such Losses are due pursuant to the terms
of this Article VIII, at the rate of interest from time to time announced
publicly by The Wall Street Journal as its prime rate, calculated on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.10, each Indemnifying Party
hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an
Action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified
Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this
Agreement with respect to such Action or the matters alleged therein and
agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect to
such claim anywhere.

 



48 Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered
from the Seller arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in Section
8.2(a), other than with respect to the Fundamental Representations, the Tax
Representation and the IP Representation shall be the funds then existing in
the Indemnity Escrow Fund; (ii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered from the Seller arising out of or relating to
the IP Representation, when aggregated with all other Losses covered by
8.5(a)(i) paid by the Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, shall be an
amount equal to $25,000,000; (iii) the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Seller arising out of or
relating to the breach of the Fundamental Representations or the Tax
Representations, in each case when aggregated with all other Losses paid by
the Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, shall be an amount equal to the
Purchase Price; and (iv) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from the Seller under Section 8.2(b), when aggregated
with all other Losses paid by the Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be limited to the Purchase Price; provided, that the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) shall not apply to Losses arising out of fraud with intent to
deceive or willful misrepresentation. The Indemnified Party may not make a
claim for indemnification under Section 8.2(a) for breach by the Indemnifying
Party of a particular representation or warranty after the expiration of the
survival period thereof specified in Section 8.1, except as otherwise provided
in Section 8.1.

 

Section 8.6 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge_
, No Reliance, Recovery from Third Parties.

 

(a) If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Buyer
expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any Losses
arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained herein, notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to
or knowledge of the Buyer in respect of any facts or circumstances that
reveal the occurrence of any such breach, whether before or after the
execution and delivery hereof.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article III and
the SellerÂ’s representations and warranties in the Ancillary Agreements and
the certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement, neither the Seller nor
any other Person has made or makes any other express or implied representation
or warranty, either written or oral, on behalf of the Seller.

 



49 (c) The amount of indemnifiable Losses to which any Indemnified Party may
be entitled will be reduced by any amount recovered for such Losses from
third parties, including insurance funds or warranty, in each case net of the
funds incurred by such Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovered amount.

 

Section 8.7 _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. The Buyer hereby agrees that it shall
first seek a remedy from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the extent of the
amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with respect to any
indemnification claim asserted hereunder before seeking to recover any Losses
directly from the Seller.

 

Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to Section 10.12(b), this Article VIII
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees and the
Seller Indemnitees from and after the Closing Date for any claims arising
under or relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any schedule,
certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and in no event may any Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee be entitled to recover for the same Loss under
two or more separate provisions of this Agreement (and it is hereby clarified
that no two or more Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled
to recover for the same Loss); _provided __,_ _however_ , that the foregoing
clause of this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right
to specific performance or injunctive relief.

Section 8.9 _Nature of Payments_. Any payment under this Article VIII
shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to
the extent such characterization is proper and permissible under relevant Tax
authorities.

ARTICLE IX

to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

 

(b) (i) by the Seller, if the Buyer breaches or fails to perform in any
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the

cured within 30 days following delivery to the Buyer of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform, and (C) has not been waived by the Seller

cured within 30 days following delivery to the Seller of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform, and (C) has not been waived by the Buyer;

Date_ "), or (ii) by the Buyer, if any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 or Section 7.3 shall have become incapable of fulfillment prior to the End
Date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(c) shall not be available if the failure of the party so
requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of such
condition to be satisfied on or prior to such date;

 

(d) by either the Seller or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred
by the End Date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available if the failure of the
party so requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to such date; or

(e) by either the Seller or the Buyer in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting under Applicable Laws
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree,
ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
that the party so requesting termination shall have used its commercially
reasonable efforts, in accordance with Section 5.9, to have such order,
decree, ruling or other action vacated.

Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become

Order or Law under Regulatory Laws), Section 7.1(b) or 7.3(c) (as a result of
any Action relating to the HSR Act or any other Law relating to antitrust or
regulation of competition), shall not have been satisfied, or (B) pursuant to
Section 9.1(e), only in connection with any Order or Action by a Governmental
Entity with respect to Regulatory Laws;

 



51 (ii) the failure of one or more of the conditions in Section 7.1(a)

of this Agreement by the Seller; and

(iii) all other conditions to the obligations of the Buyer to consummate the
transaction set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied or
waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be

were to occur);

then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller or the SellerÂ’s Affiliates, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the Seller, a cash amount (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ ")
equal to $10,000,000 within two Business Days of termination, it being
understood that in no event shall the Seller be entitled to the Buyer
Termination Fee referred to in this Section 9.3 on more than one occasion.

 

(b) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The Seller agrees that, in the event that the
Buyer Termination Fee is paid to the Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant

Affiliate of the Buyer shall have any further liability or obligation to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

the HSR Act or any other Law relating to antitrust or regulation of
competition) shall not have been satisfied, then, at the written election of
the Buyer (subject to the other conditions set forth in this Section 9.5), the
End Date may be extended no more than two times in the aggregate, each time
by a period of three months (and in the case of such extension, any reference
to the End Date in any other provision of this Agreement shall be a reference
to the End Date, as extended pursuant to this Section 9.5); provided, that
the End Date shall under no circumstance be extended beyond June 30, 2013 ("
_Final End Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the
BuyerÂ’s right to elect to extend the End Date described in this Section 9.5
shall be available to the Buyer only if the Buyer shall have reasonably
determined in good faith at the time of such extension that the closing
conditions that have not been satisfied as of such date are reasonably likely
to be satisfied by the Final End Date. In the event the Buyer elects to extend
the End Date, the Buyer shall give written notice of such election to the
Seller in accordance with Section 10.5, which notice shall include
a statement by the Buyer that it believes in good faith that the closing
conditions that have not been satisfied as of such date are reasonably likely
to be satisfied by the Final End Date. In the absence of an election, the
Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to not extend the End Date.

 



52 ARTICLE X

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 10.1 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with or related to this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
such transactions are consummated; _provided_ , that no such fees or expenses
payable by the Seller shall be paid from any assets otherwise transferable to
the Buyer pursuant hereto. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the
obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights
of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement by the other.

Section 10.2 _Withholding_. The Buyer (or its agents) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable any amounts that

right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are

any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument

understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. Notwithstanding any oral agreement or course of conduct of the

by the other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined in the Court of Chancery, located in the State of Delaware (or, if

irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence
any Action relating thereto except in the Court of Chancery, located in the
State of Delaware (or, if such court

lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), other than Actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that
notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and
the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each
of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, any Action (a) that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid
of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) that
(i) the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such Action is improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 10.11 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either
party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may assign this Agreement to any
Affiliate of the Buyer without the prior consent of the Seller; _provided
further_ , that no assignment shall limit the assignorÂ’s obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.12 _Enforcement_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Subject to Section 9.3(b),
each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware (or, if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any Action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

 



56 (b) The Seller agrees that, to the extent it makes claims in respect
of breaches of the Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement that constitutes or results in a breach of Section 5.9 (" _Antitrust
Efforts Claims_ "), to the extent related to or resulting in the failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) (as a result of an Order or Law
under the HSR Act), or Section 7.1(b) to have been satisfied, then,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the aggregate liability
of the Buyer pursuant to all Antitrust Efforts Claims shall be limited to a
maximum amount equal to the Buyer Termination Fee. To the extent any amounts
are paid to the Seller pursuant to Antitrust Efforts Claims before the payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee, the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee shall
be reduced so that the sum of all amounts previously paid pursuant to the
Antitrust Efforts Claims plus the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee will
equal the aggregate amounts as would have been payable pursuant to the
previous sentence if the Buyer Termination Fee had been paid prior to all
payments with respect to the Antitrust Claims.

Section 10.13 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is
the currency used for all purposes in this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement.

Section 10.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any Applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

Section 10.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 10.16 _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. A facsimile,
PDF or other electronic signature of this Agreement shall be valid and have
the same force and effect as a manually signed original.

 

Section 10.17 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.18 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the Buyer and
the Seller acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this

 

Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against
the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.
