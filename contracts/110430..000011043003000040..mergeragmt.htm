All shares of Holly  Common Stock shall cease to be  outstanding  and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease

shares of Holly  Common  Stock  shall  thereafter  cease to have any rights  with  respect to such  shares of Holly
Common Stock,  except as provided in Section 2.9 the right to receive the Holly Merger  Consideration  to be issued
in consideration  therefor,  including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of applicable Parent Common Stock with
respect thereto to be issued in consideration  therefor,  and any dividends or other distributions to which holders

(a) &nbsp;    Prior to the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall  designate  a bank or trust  company to act as agent for the
holders of shares of Holly Common Stock in connection  with the Holly Merger (the "<U>Exchange  Agent</U>") to receive the
Holly  Merger  Consideration  to which  holders of such shares  shall  become  entitled  pursuant  to Section  2.2.
Promptly  after the Effective  Time,  but in no event later than three  business  days  following the Closing Date,
Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent  certificates  representing  Parent Common Stock and cash sufficient to
make all  payments  pursuant  to Section  2.2 and  Section  2.10 and,  when and as needed,  Frontier or Parent will
deposit with the Exchange  Agent cash  sufficient  to make all  payments  pursuant to Section 2.8 (such funds,  the
"<U>Exchange Fund</U>").
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) &nbsp;     Promptly  after the Effective  Time,  but in no event later than three business days following the Closing
Date,  Parent shall cause to be mailed to each record  holder,  at the  Effective  Time,  of an  outstanding  Holly
Certificate,  a form of letter of  transmittal  (which shall specify that delivery  shall be effected,  and risk of
loss and title to the Holly  Certificates  shall pass,  only upon proper  delivery of the Holly  Certificate to the
Exchange  Agent) and  instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of the Holly  Certificate for payment of the
Holly Merger  Consideration  therefor.  Within three business days after surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Holly
Certificate,  together with such letter of transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions  thereto,  and such other documents as may be required  pursuant to such  instructions,  the holder of
such Holly Certificate  shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor the Holly Merger  Consideration for each
share  formerly  represented  by such  Holly  Certificate  and  such  Holly  Certificate  shall  then be  canceled.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Holly  Certificates  surrendered  for exchange by any Holly Rule 145 Affiliate (as
determined  pursuant to Section  5.10) shall not be exchanged  until Parent has received a written  agreement  from
such  Person as  provided  in Section  5.10.  No  interest  shall be paid or accrued  for the benefit of holders of
Holly Certificates on the Holly Merger Consideration  payable upon the surrender of Holly Certificates  (including,
without  limitation,  any cash  payable  pursuant to Section 2.8 or Section  2.10).  If payment of the Holly Merger
Consideration  is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered  Holly  Certificate is
registered,  it shall be a  condition  of payment  that the Holly  Certificate  so  surrendered  shall be  properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person  requesting  such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Holly Merger  Consideration  to a person
other  than  the  registered  holder  of the  Holly  Certificate  surrendered  or  shall  have  established  to the
satisfaction of Holly Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

(a) &nbsp;     As used in this  Agreement,  a "<U>Stock  Plan</U>"  shall be any plan or  agreement  pursuant to which an option
("<U>Stock Option</U>") has been or may be granted to any employee,  director,  independent contractor or former employee,
director or  independent  contractor to acquire  shares of Holly Common  Stock,  Frontier  Common Stock,  or Parent
Common  Stock,  as the case may be.  "<U>Stock Plan</U>" shall also  include any plan or  agreement  pursuant to which any
stock  appreciation  rights,  phantom  stock,  restricted  stock,  restricted  stock units,  deferred  stock units,
dividend equivalents or other equity-based  compensation  ("<U>Stock-Based  Awards</U>") has been or may be granted to any
employee,  director,  independent  contractor or former employee,  director or independent  contractor.  As used in
this  Section 2.5,  "<U>Option  Exchange  Ratio</U>" shall mean the quotient of (i) the sum of the Average  Price plus the
Cash  Consideration  divided by (ii) the Average  Price.  The "<U>Average  Price</U>" shall mean the average of the volume
weighted  sales prices per share of the Frontier  Common Stock on the New York Stock  Exchange,  Inc. (the "<U>NYSE</U>"),
as reported by Bloomberg  Financial  Markets (or, if not reported  thereby,  by any other  authoritative  source as
Frontier  and Holly shall agree in writing)  for the five  consecutive  full  trading days in which such shares are
traded  on the NYSE  ending on the third  full  trading  day  prior  to,  but not  including,  the day on which the

an option to purchase  shares of Parent Common Stock (a "<U>Parent Stock  Option</U>"),  on the same terms and  conditions
as were  applicable  under such Holly Stock  Option (but taking into  account any changes  thereto,  including  the
acceleration  thereof,  provided for in the Holly Stock Plans, in any award agreement or in such Holly Stock Option
by reason of this  Agreement  or the  transactions  contemplated  hereby).  The  number of shares of Parent  Common
Stock which shall be subject to each such Parent  Stock  Option shall be the number of shares of Holly Common Stock
subject to each such Holly Stock Option  multiplied by the Option Exchange  Ratio,  rounded,  if necessary,  to the
nearest  whole share of Parent Common  Stock,  and such Parent Stock Option shall have an exercise  price per share
of Parent Common Stock  (rounded to the nearest one  hundredth of a cent) equal to the exercise  price per share of
Holly Common Stock for such Holly Stock Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio;  provided,  however,  that, in
the case of any Holly Stock Option to which  Section 421 of the Code as of the  Effective  Time (after  taking into
account the effect of any accelerated  vesting  thereof) applies by reason of its  qualification  under Section 422
of the Code, the exercise  price,  the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms
and  conditions of exercise of such option shall be  determined in a manner  consistent  with the  requirements  of
Section 424(a) of the Code. For purposes of this Section  2.5(b) and Section  2.5(c),  the number of shares and the
exercise price per share under each Holly Stock Option or Holly Stock-Based  Award shall be adjusted  appropriately
upon the  occurrence  of any of the events  contemplated  in Section  2.2(e) hereof to provide the holders of Holly
Stock Options and Holly  Stock-Based  Awards the same economic  effect as  contemplated  by this Agreement prior to
the occurrence of such event.

(each, a "<U>Holly Stock-Based Award</U>"),  whether vested or unvested,  which is outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Effective  Time shall cease to  represent a right or award with  respect to shares of Holly  Common Stock and shall
be canceled in  consideration  for a cash  payment  (i)  computed  according  to the  relevant  terms of each Holly
Stock-Based  Award or (ii) if  consented  to by the holder of the Holly  Stock-Based  Award,  at a per-share  price
equal to the  average of the volume  weighted  sales  prices per share of the Holly  Common  Stock on the  American
Stock Exchange,  Inc.  ("<U>AMEX</U>"),  as reported by Bloomberg  Financial Markets (or, if not reported thereby,  by any
other  authoritative  source as Frontier  and Holly shall agree in writing) for the five  consecutive  full trading
days in which such  shares are traded on AMEX  ending on the third full  trading  day prior to, but not  including,
the day on which the Effective  Time occurs.  This price shall be calculated  to the nearest  one-hundredth  of one
cent.

agreements  have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and  conditions  (subject to
the  adjustments  required by this Section 2.5 after giving  effect to the Mergers and the terms of the Holly Stock
Plans) pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan.

vested or unvested) and converted  into a Parent Stock Option  pursuant to Section  2.5(b) shall,  upon exercise of
such Parent Stock  Option,  receive one CVR for each share of Holly Common Stock into which such Holly Stock Option
was  exercisable  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time. No CVRs shall be issued to any such holder of a Parent
Stock Option who does not exercise  such Parent Stock Option prior to the first  payment date of any payment to the

to vote on any matter.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Holly  Common Stock that  occurred  prior to the
Effective Time, but is not registered in the transfer  records of Holly,  one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
evidencing,  in the aggregate,  the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of
cash that such holder has the right to receive  pursuant to the  provisions  of this Article 2,  including  cash in
lieu of any  fractional  shares  of Parent  Common  Stock  pursuant  to  Section  2.10 and any  dividends  or other
distributions  to which such holder is entitled  pursuant to Section  2.8, may be issued with respect to such Holly
Common Stock to such a transferee if the Holly  Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent,  accompanied by all
documents  required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any  applicable  stock transfer taxes
have been paid.  If any  certificate  for shares of Parent  Common  Stock is to be issued in a name other than that
in which the Holly  Certificate  surrendered in exchange  therefor is  registered,  it shall be a condition of such
exchange that the Person  requesting  such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of  certificates  for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered  holder of
the Holly  Certificate  surrendered,  or shall  establish to the reasonable  satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(b)&nbsp;      Each Frontier  Certificate (and each uncertificated  share of Frontier Common Stock in book-entry form, if
any,  prior to the  Effective  Time) shall be deemed to represent an  equivalent  number of shares of Parent Common
Stock  without any action on the part of the holder  thereof;  provided,  however,  that if an exchange of Frontier
Certificates  for new  certificates  is required by law or applicable  rule or  regulation,  or is requested by any
holder thereof, the parties will cause Parent to arrange for such exchange on a one-share-for-one-share basis.

entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this
Section 2.10, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be

requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to

Material  Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its  properties  or assets is bound,  except for
violations or defaults that would not have,  individually  or in the aggregate,  a Holly Material  Adverse  Effect.
Each Holly Material  Contract is in full force and effect,  and is a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of Holly
or one of its  Subsidiaries  and, to the knowledge of Holly,  each of the other  parties  thereto,  enforceable  in
accordance with its terms,  except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium or
other similar laws relating to creditors'  rights and general  principles of equity and except where the failure of
any  Holly  Material  Contract  to be in full  force and  effect  or a legal,  valid  and  binding  obligation  and
enforceable  in  accordance  with its terms would not have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Holly  Material
Adverse  Effect.  No condition  exists or event has occurred which (whether with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) would  constitute a default by Holly or one of its  Subsidiaries  or, to the knowledge of Holly, any other
party  thereto  under any  Holly  Material  Contract  or result  in a right of  termination  of any Holly  Material
Contract,  except for any  condition  or event  that  would not have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Holly

(a)&nbsp;      Except for documents  filed or listed as exhibits to the Frontier  Reports filed since  December 31,  2002
("<U>Frontier Material  Contracts</U>"),  as of the date hereof, there are no contracts or leases that are material to the
business,  properties,  assets, financial condition or results of operations of Frontier and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.  Neither  Frontier nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is in violation of or in default under (nor does there
exist any  condition  which with the  passage of time or the giving of notice or both would  cause such a violation
of or  default  under)  any  Frontier  Material  Contract  to  which  it is a party  or by  which  it or any of its
properties  or assets is bound,  except for  violations  or defaults  that would not have,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  a Frontier Material Adverse Effect.  Each Frontier  Material Contract is in full force and effect,  and
is a legal,  valid and  binding  obligation  of  Frontier  or one of its  Subsidiaries  and,  to the  knowledge  of
Frontier,  each  of the  other  parties  thereto,  enforceable  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  except  as  such
enforceability  may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors'
rights and general  principles  of equity and except where the failure of any Frontier  Material  Contract to be in
full force and effect or a legal,  valid and binding  obligation and enforceable in accordance with its terms would
not have,  individually or in the aggregate,  a Frontier  Material Adverse Effect. No condition exists or event has
occurred  which  (whether with or without  notice or lapse of time or both) would  constitute a default by Frontier
or one of its  Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Frontier,  any other party thereto under any Frontier  Material
Contract or result in a right of termination of any Frontier Material  Contract,  except for any condition or event
that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Frontier Material Adverse Effect.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)   &nbsp;   Set forth in Schedule 4.19(b) of the Frontier  Disclosure Letter is, as of the date hereof,  (i) a list of
all loan or credit agreements,  notes, bonds,  mortgages,  indentures and other agreements and instruments pursuant
to which  any  indebtedness  of  Frontier  or its  Subsidiaries  in an  aggregate  principal  amount  in  excess of
$1,000,000 is outstanding or may be incurred,  (ii) the respective  principal amounts outstanding  thereunder as of
the date hereof and (iii) the  approximate  amount of  consolidated  cash and cash  equivalents of Frontier and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) &nbsp;     Neither Frontier nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has entered into any contract,  and there is no commitment,
judgment,  injunction,  order or decree to which Frontier or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject to, that
has or would  reasonably  be expected to have the effect of  prohibiting  or  impairing  the conduct of business by
Frontier  or any of its  Subsidiaries  (or of Parent or any of its other  Subsidiaries  after the  Mergers)  or any
contract  that may be  terminable  as a result of Holly's  status as a  competitor  of any party to such  contract,
except,  in each case, for any prohibition,  impairment or termination  right that would not have,  individually or
in the aggregate, a Frontier Material Adverse Effect.

representatives of the other party reasonable access at all reasonable times
upon reasonable notice to the records and files, correspondence, audits and
properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts,

believes constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or
which it is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or agreement
with third parties. The parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions
of the preceding sentence apply. Holly and Frontier agree that they will not,
and will cause their representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.6 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All nonpublic information

<B>REGISTRATION STATEMENT</B>. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, Frontier and Holly shall cooperate in preparing and each shall
cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable joint proxy materials (the
&#147;<U>Proxy Statement/Prospectus</U>&#148;) and Frontier and Holly shall
prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 under the Securities Act (the &#147;<U>Registration Statement</U>&#148;).
The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus in and will
constitute a part of the Registration Statement as Parent&#146;s prospectus.
Each of Frontier, Holly and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Frontier, Holly and Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other parties with copies of any
written comments, and advise each other of any oral comments, with respect to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement received from the SEC.
Frontier, Holly and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other parties with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement prior to filing
such with the SEC, and each will provide each other party with a copy of all
such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to
the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by
reference) to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement shall
be made without the approval of both Frontier and Holly, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that, with respect to
documents filed by a party hereto that are incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval
shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or its
business, financial condition or results of operations; and provided, further,
that Frontier, in connection with a change in the recommendation of its Board of
Directors as to the Mergers, and Holly, in connection with a change in the
recommendation of its Board of Directors as to the Mergers, may amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement (including
by incorporation by reference) to effect such a change, and in such event, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the
other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, and
shall be subject to the right of each party to have its Board of Directors&#146;
deliberations and conclusions accurately described. Frontier will use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to be mailed to Frontier
stockholders, and Holly will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Holly stockholders, in each case, as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Each of Frontier, Holly and Parent shall advise the
other parties, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to Frontier or Holly, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Frontier or Holly and such
information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto
discovering such information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to the
extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Frontier and Holly. </FONT></P>

</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)  &nbsp;    From and after the  Effective  Time,  Parent shall as provided in this Section 5.12 cause each of Frontier
Surviving  Corporation  and Holly  Surviving  Corporation  to  indemnify,  defend and hold  harmless to the fullest
extent  permitted under  applicable law each person who is immediately  prior to the Effective Time, or has been at
any time  prior to the  Effective  Time,  an  officer  or  director  of  Frontier  or Holly,  respectively  (or any
Subsidiary or division  thereof),  and each person who immediately  prior to the Effective Time is serving or prior
to the  Effective  Time has served at the  request of  Frontier or Holly,  respectively,  as a  director,  officer,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit
plan or enterprise  (individually,  an "<U>Indemnified Party</U>" and,  collectively,  the "<U>Indemnified  Parties</U>") against
all losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities,  costs or expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees),  judgments,  fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,  action,  suit,  proceeding or investigation
arising out of or  pertaining to acts or omissions,  or alleged acts or omissions,  by them in their  capacities as
such,  whether  commenced,  asserted or claimed  before or after the  Effective  Time,  to the fullest  extent such
indemnification  by Frontier  Surviving  Corporation or Holly Surviving  Corporation,  as applicable,  is permitted
under applicable law. In the event of any such claim,  action,  suit,  proceeding or  investigation  (an "<U>Action</U>"),
(i) Parent shall cause each of Frontier Surviving Corporation and Holly Surviving  Corporation,  as applicable,  to
pay, as incurred,  the fees and expenses of counsel  selected by the  Indemnified  Party,  which  counsel  shall be
reasonably  acceptable  to Parent,  in advance of the final  disposition  of any such Action to the fullest  extent
permitted by applicable  law, and, if required,  upon receipt of any  undertaking  required by applicable  law, and
(ii) Parent  will,  and will cause each of Frontier  Surviving  Corporation  and Holly  Surviving  Corporation,  as
applicable,  to,  cooperate  in the  defense  of any such  matter;  provided,  however,  none of  Parent,  Frontier
Surviving  Corporation  or Holly  Surviving  Corporation  shall be liable for any settlement  effected  without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  and provided  further that none of
Parent,  Frontier Surviving  Corporation or Holly Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section
5.12(a)  to pay the fees and  disbursements  of more  than one  counsel,  except  for one  local  counsel,  for all
Indemnified  Parties in any single Action,  unless,  in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified  Parties,
there is or may be a conflict of interests  between two or more of such  Indemnified  Parties,  in which case there
may be separate  counsel  for each  similarly  situated  group.  With  respect to any  determination  of whether an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification by Holly Surviving  Corporation or Frontier Surviving  Corporation
under this Section 5.12, the  Indemnified  Party shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that
such  determination be made by special,  independent  legal counsel selected by the Indemnified  Party and approved
by Holly  Surviving  Corporation or Frontier  Surviving  Corporation,  as applicable  (which  approval shall not be
unreasonably  withheld),  and who has  not  otherwise  performed  material  services  for  Frontier,  Holly  or the
Indemnified Party within the last three (3) years.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)   &nbsp;   The rights to indemnification  hereunder,  including  provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred
in defense of any action or suit, in the  certificate of  incorporation  or articles of  incorporation,  bylaws and
any  indemnification  agreement  of  Frontier,  Holly and their  respective  Subsidiaries  with  respect to matters
occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) &nbsp;     For a period of six years  after the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall,  or shall  cause  each of  Frontier
Surviving  Corporation and Holly Surviving  Corporation to, maintain officers' and directors'  liability  insurance
covering  the  Indemnified  Parties  who are or at any time  prior to the  Effective  Time  were  covered  by their
respective  officers' and directors'  liability insurance ("<U>D&amp;O Insurance</U>") policies on terms substantially no less
advantageous  to the  Indemnified  Parties  than such  existing  insurance  with respect to acts or  omissions,  or
alleged acts or omissions,  prior to the Effective  Time (whether  claims,  actions or other  proceedings  relating
thereto  are  commenced,  asserted  or  claimed  before or after the  Effective  Time);  provided  that,  after the
Effective Time,  neither Frontier  Surviving  Corporation nor Holly Surviving  Corporation shall be required to pay
annual  premiums in excess of 250% of the annual premium amount  payable by Frontier or Holly,  as applicable,  for
the policy year  including the date hereof (the amount of which  premiums are set forth in Schedule  5.12(c) of the
respective  Disclosure  Letters),  but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably  practicable  for
such amount.  Parent shall have the right to cause  coverage to be extended  under the D&amp;O Insurance of Frontier or
Holly by  obtaining a six-year  "tail"  policy on terms and  conditions  substantially  no less  advantageous  than
Frontier's or Holly's  respective  existing D&amp;O  Insurance,  and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of
this Section 5.12(c).
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)  &nbsp;    The rights of each  Indemnified  Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the certificate of  incorporation,  articles of  incorporation or bylaws of Frontier or Holly,
as applicable,  or any of their respective  Subsidiaries,  under the DGCL or WBCA, or otherwise.  The provisions of
this Section 5.12 shall survive the  consummation  of the Mergers,  are  expressly  intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified  Parties,  and may not be amended or terminated  after the Effective  Time in a manner  contrary to the
interest of an Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e) &nbsp;     Notwithstanding  any other  provisions  hereof,  the obligations of Frontier,  Holly,  Frontier  Surviving
Corporation,  Holly  Surviving  Corporation  and Parent  contained  in this  Section 5.12 shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of Parent,  Frontier  Surviving  Corporation and Holly Surviving  Corporation.  In the event
Frontier,  Holly, Frontier Surviving Corporation,  Holly Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective
successors  or  assigns   (i) consolidates  with  or  merges  into  any  other  person  or  (ii) transfers  all  or
substantially  all of its properties and assets to any person,  then and in each such case,  proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Frontier,  Holly,  Frontier  Surviving  Corporation,  Holly Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.

Options and Frontier  Stock  Options into Parent Stock  Options  (and the  acquisition  of shares of Parent  Common
Stock  thereunder)  at the Effective Time by officers and directors of Frontier and Holly  (including  officers and

officers or  directors  of Parent) as a result of the  conversion  of shares of Frontier  and Holly Common Stock in

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;      <U>Amount;  Time</U>.  The  Preferred  Stock at the time  outstanding  shall be entitled to receive,  as and when
declared by the Board of Directors,  out of any funds of the Corporation legally available  therefor,  dividends at
the rate fixed by the Board of  Directors  (pursuant  to  Section 1 of Part I of this  Article  Six),  and no more,
payable on such date or dates in each year as the Board of Directors shall determine.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;      <U>Cumulative  Dividends</U>.  Dividends  on  Preferred  Stock  may be  cumulative,  noncumulative  or  partially

(c) &nbsp;     <U>Priority  Over  Common;  Restriction  on  Purchases  of Common</U>.  No dividend  shall be declared or paid on

to the holders of Common Stock,  the holders of each series of Preferred Stock then  outstanding  shall be entitled
to receive the amount  fixed by the Board of  Directors  (pursuant to Section 1 of Part I of this Article Six) plus
a sum equal to all  cumulative  but unpaid  dividends  (whether  or not earned or  declared)  to the date fixed for
distribution,  and no more.  All  remaining  assets  shall be  distributed  pro rata  among the  holders  of Common
Stock. If the assets  distributable  among the holders of Preferred  Stock are  insufficient to permit full payment
to them,  the entire assets will be  distributed  among the holders of the  Preferred  Stock in proportion to their
respective liquidation preferences.

have received  payment for each share of Preferred Stock equal to the redemption  price therefor (as established by
the Board of Directors),  the remaining assets of the Corporation  available for distribution to shareholders shall

Common Stock owned by each such holder bears to the  aggregate  number of issued and  outstanding  shares of Common
Stock.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <I>Voting</I>.  The  holders of shares of Common  Stock  shall  possess  full  voting  power in the  election  of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) &nbsp;     No  director  of the  Corporation  shall be  liable  to the  Corporation  or any of its  shareholders  for
monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure to take any action,  as a director,  except that this Article
Eight does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:  (i) the  amount of financial  benefit  received
by a director to which he or she is not entitled,  (ii) an  intentional  infliction of harm on the  Corporation  or
its  shareholders,  (iii) an  unlawful  distribution  in  violation  of W.S.  17-16-833  of the  WBCA,  or  (iv) an

No  amendment  to or repeal of this  Article  Eight shall apply to or have any effect on the  liability  or alleged
liability  of any  director  of the  Corporation  for or with  respect to any acts or  omissions  of such  director
occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)  &nbsp;    The Corporation shall indemnify,  in accordance with and to the fullest extent now or hereafter  permitted

or completed action,  suit or proceeding,  whether civil,  criminal,  administrative  or investigative  (including,

was a  director  or officer of the  Corporation,  or is or was  serving  at the  request  of the  Corporation  as a
director,  officer, employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise,  against any liability or expense,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees,  actually and

(iii) an unlawful  distribution  in violation of W.S.  17-16-833 of the WBCA, or (iv) an  intentional  violation of

Corporation in advance of the final  disposition of the action,  suit or proceeding  upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay the amount if it shall  ultimately  be  determined  that he or
she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article Eight.

(d)  &nbsp;    The  indemnification  and advancement of expenses  authorized by this Article Eight shall not be exclusive
of any other rights to which any director,  officer,  employee or agent may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,
vote of  shareholders  or  disinterested  directors  or  otherwise,  both as to any  action in his or her  official
capacity  and as to action in another  capacity  while  holding the office,  and  continues  as to a person who has

provided for in this Section&#160;5 and on the record date for the determination

ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the

anniversary date, notice by the shareholder, in order to be timely, must be so
received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following
the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or
public disclosure (as defined below) of the date of the annual meeting was made,
whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public disclosure of an
adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a
shareholder&#146;s notice as described above. For purposes of this second
paragraph of Section&#160;5, &#147;public disclosure&#148; shall mean disclosure
in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, PR

all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person
or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such
business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in
such business and (v)&#160;a representation that such shareholder intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No

business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section&#160;5; <I>provided, however</I>, that once business has
been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such
procedures, nothing in this Section&#160;5 shall be deemed to preclude
discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the chair of an annual
meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual
meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chair shall declare
that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business
shall not be transacted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
a special meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as

Unless otherwise required by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
(i)&#160;any question brought before any meeting of shareholders shall be
decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented and
entitled to vote thereat, and (ii)&#160;each shareholder represented at a
meeting of shareholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the
capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such shareholder. Such votes may
be cast in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted on or after three (3)
years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. The Board
of Directors, in its discretion, or the chair of a meeting of shareholders, in

the persons who  constitute  the board of directors of Holly that is not approved in advance by at least a majority
of the  persons who were  directors  of Holly as of the date of this  Agreement  (or their  successors  who were so
approved);  (2) any change in the  present  capitalization  of Holly or any  amendment  of Holly's  certificate  of
incorporation  or bylaws;  (3) any other material  change in Holly's  corporate  structure or business;  or (4) any
other action or proposal  involving  Holly or any of its  subsidiaries  that is intended,  or could  reasonably  be

by the  Merger  Agreement.  Any  such  vote  shall be cast or  consent  shall be  given  in  accordance  with  such
procedures  relating  thereto as shall ensure that it is duly counted for purposes of determining  that a quorum is
present and for  purposes of  recording  the results of such vote or consent.  Holder  agrees not to enter into any
agreement,  letter of intent,  agreement in principle or  understanding  with any person that violates or conflicts
with or could  reasonably be expected to violate or conflict with the provisions  and agreements  contained in this
Agreement or the Merger  Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt,  this Agreement is intended to constitute a voting
agreement  entered  into under  Section  218(a) of the  Delaware  General  Corporation  Law for the duration of the
Voting Period.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (b) &nbsp;    <B> Grant of Irrevocable  Proxy</B>.  Holder hereby appoints  Frontier and any designee of Frontier,  and

resubstitution,  to vote or act by written  consent  during the Voting  Period  with  respect to  Holder's  Subject
Shares in  accordance  with Section  1(a).  This proxy is given to secure the  performance  of the duties of Holder
under this  Agreement.  Holder shall  promptly  cause a copy of this  Agreement  to be deposited  with Holly at its
principal  place of business.  Holder shall execute such other  instruments  as may be necessary to effectuate  the
intent of this proxy.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (c) &nbsp;     <B>Nature of Irrevocable  Proxy</B>.  The proxy and power of attorney  granted  pursuant to Section 1(b)

sufficient  in law to support  an  irrevocable  proxy and shall  revoke all prior  proxies  granted by Holder.  The
power of attorney  granted  herein is a durable  power of attorney and shall survive the  dissolution,  bankruptcy,
death or incapacity  of Holder.  For the  avoidance of doubt,  the proxy and power of attorney is granted  pursuant

a party to this voting  agreement  which is created under Section 218(a) of the Delaware  General  Corporation  Law

to, the sale, transfer,  tender,  pledge,  encumbrance,  assignment or other disposition of, any or all of Holder's
Subject  Shares;  (b) grant any  proxies or powers of attorney  in respect of the  Subject  Shares,  deposit any of
Holder's  Subject  Shares  into a voting  trust or enter into a voting  agreement  with  respect to any of Holder's
Subject  Shares;  (c) exercise  any Holly Stock  Options or fail to give any  requested or required  consent to the
conversion  of any Holly Stock  Options  into Parent  Stock  Options as provided  for in and pursuant to the Merger

adversely   affecting  Holder's  ability  to  perform  Holder's   respective   obligations  under  this  Agreement.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  nothing herein shall prevent  Holder from  assigning or  transferring  any Subject
Shares  beneficially  owned by Holder to any spouse,  parent,  child,  trust,  trust  beneficiary,  estate,  family
partnership,  partner,  foundation  (whether  family,  private  or  public)  or other  charitable  organization  (a
"<U>Permitted  Transferee</U>") if such Permitted  Transferee  agrees in writing to hold any Subject Shares subject to all
of the  provisions of this  Agreement as Holder  hereunder.  Holder  further agrees to timely execute and deliver a

or consent  shall be given in  accordance  with such  procedures  relating  thereto as shall ensure that it is duly
counted for purposes of  determining  that a quorum is present and for  purposes of  recording  the results of such
vote or consent.  Affiliate  agrees not to enter into any  agreement,  letter of intent,  agreement in principle or
understanding  with any person  that  violates  or  conflicts  with or could  reasonably  be expected to violate or
conflict  with the  provisions  and  agreements  contained  in this  Agreement  or the  Merger  Agreement.  For the
avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is intended to constitute a voting agreement  entered into under W.S.  17-16-731

transferring  any  Subject  Shares  beneficially  owned by  Affiliate  to any trust,  estate,  family  partnership,
foundation  (whether  family,  private or public) or other  charitable  organization (a "<U>Permitted  Transferee</U>") if

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (a)  &nbsp;    <U>Indemnification  by the  Company</U>.  The Company  will  indemnify  and hold  harmless  the Holders,
their  officers,  directors,  agents  (including  without  limitation  counsel) and  employees  and each Person who
controls  the Holders  (within the meaning of the  Securities  Act or the  Exchange  Act) (each,  a  "<B><U>Controlling
Person</U></B>")  from and against any and all  losses,  claims,  damages and  liabilities  ("<B><U>Losses</U></B>")  (including  without
limitation any  investigation,  legal or other expenses  reasonably  incurred in connection  with, and,  subject to
Section 7(d) any amount paid in settlement of, any action,  suit or proceeding or any claim  asserted) to which the
Holders may become  subject under the Securities  Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state  statutory law or
regulation,  at common law or otherwise,  insofar as such Losses arise out of, are based upon,  relate to or result
from (a) any untrue  statement  or alleged  untrue  statement  of a material  fact  contained  in any  registration
statement,  prospectus or preliminary  prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or the omission or alleged
omission  to state  therein a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary  to make the  statements
therein not  misleading  or (b) any  violation by the Company of the  Securities  Act or the Exchange Act, or other
federal or state law  applicable  to the Company and relating to any action or inaction  required of the Company in
connection  with such  registration.  The Company  shall  reimburse the Holders or such  officer,  director,  agent
(including without limitation  counsel),  employee or Controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Person in  connection  with  investigating  or defending  against any Losses as they are incurred;
provided,  however,  that the Company will not be liable to a Holder for any Losses if any such Losses arise out of
or are  based  upon  any  alleged  untrue  statement  or  alleged  omission  made in such  registration  statement,
preliminary  prospectus,  prospectus,  or amendment or supplement  in reliance upon and in conformity  with written
information  furnished to the Company by such Holder  specifically  for use therein.  Such indemnity will remain in
full  force and  effect  regardless  of any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the  Holders  or such  officer,
director,  agent (including  without  limitation  counsel),  employee or Controlling  Person,  and will survive the
transfer of such  securities  by the  Holders.  The Company  will also  indemnify  underwriters,  selling  brokers,
dealer managers and similar securities  industry  professionals  participating in the distribution,  their officers
and directors and each Person who controls such Persons  (within the meaning of the  Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) to the same extent  customarily  requested by such  Persons in similar  circumstances.  Reimbursement  will be
made periodically  during the course of investigation when bills are received or expenses incurred,  subject to the
Holders'  obligation to reimburse the Company  pursuant to the Wyoming Business  Corporation  Act.  Notwithstanding
anything to the  contrary in this Section 7, the Company  shall not be liable for any untrue  statement or omission
in any  preliminary  prospectus if the Company,  sufficiently in advance of Holder's  delivery of such  preliminary
prospectus,  notified  Holder of any untrue  statement or omission  contained  therein and furnished  Holder with a
corrected preliminary prospectus.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (b)  &nbsp;    <U>Indemnification   by  Holder  of  Registrable   Securities</U>.   If  any  Holder  sells  Registrable
Securities  under a prospectus  that is part of a  registration  statement,  then such Holder (the  "<B><U>Indemnifying
Holder</U></B>"),  agrees,  severally,  and not jointly and  severally,  to indemnify  and hold  harmless the Company,  its
directors and each officer who signed such  registration  statement,  each Person who controls the Company  (within
the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) under the same  circumstances  as the foregoing  indemnity from
the Company to the Holders to the extent,  but only to the extent,  that such Losses arise out of or are based upon
any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or  omission  of a material  fact that was made in the  prospectus,  any
preliminary  prospectus,  the registration  statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and
in  conformity  with  written  information  relating to the  Indemnifying  Holder  furnished  to the Company by the
Indemnifying  Holder  expressly  for use therein.  In no event will the  aggregate  liability  of the  Indemnifying
Holder exceed the amount of the net proceeds  received by the Indemnifying  Holder upon the sale of the Registrable
Securities  giving rise to such  indemnification  obligation.  Such  indemnity will remain in full force and effect
regardless  of any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the  Company  or such  officer,  director,  employee  or
Controlling  Person,  and will survive the transfer of such securities by the Indemnifying  Holder. The Company and
the Holders  will be entitled to receive  indemnities  from  underwriters,  selling  brokers,  dealer  managers and
similar  securities  industry  professionals  participating in the distribution,  to the same extent as customarily
furnished by such Persons in similar  circumstances.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this  Section 7,
no Holder  selling  Registrable  Shares  shall be liable for any untrue  statement  or omission in any  preliminary
prospectus or  registration  statement if prior to the  registration  becoming  effective or prior to the filing of
any amendment or supplement  thereto,  such Holder has furnished  information  in writing to the Company  expressly
for use in such  registration  statement or prospectus or any amendment  thereof or supplement  thereto  correcting
such untrue  statement or omission and such  information is not contained in the  prospectus or such  supplement or
amendment.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (c)  &nbsp;    Contribution.  If the  indemnification  provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an
indemnified  party or is  insufficient to hold such  indemnified  party harmless for any Losses in respect of which
Section 7(a)  or 7(b)  would  otherwise  apply by its  terms  (other  than by  reason  of  exceptions  provided  in
Section 7(a) or 7(b), then each applicable  indemnifying  party, in lieu of indemnifying  such  indemnified  party,
will have a several,  and not joint and several,  obligation  to  contribute  to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified  party as a result of such Losses,  in such  proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the indemnifying  party, on the one hand, and such indemnified  party, on the other hand, in connection with the
actions,  statements  or  omissions  that  resulted  in  such  Losses  as  well  as any  other  relevant  equitable
considerations.  The relative fault of such  indemnifying  party,  on the one hand, and  indemnified  party, on the
other hand,  will be  determined by reference  to, among other  things,  whether any action in question,  including
without  limitation  any untrue or alleged untrue  statement of a material fact or omission or alleged  omission to
state a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information  supplied by, such  indemnifying  party
or indemnified  party,  and the parties'  relative  intent,  knowledge,  access to information  and  opportunity to
correct or prevent any such action,  statement  or  omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
any Losses  will be deemed to include  any legal or other fees or  expenses  incurred  by such party in  connection
with any  investigation  or proceeding,  to the extent such party would have been  indemnified for such expenses if
the  indemnification  provided  for in  Section 7(a)  or 7(b) was  available  to such  party.  No Person  guilty of
fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the  meaning of Section  11(f) of the  Securities  Act) shall be entitled to
contribution  from  any  Person  who was not  guilty  of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation.  Notwithstanding  the
provisions  of this  Section 7(c),  no Holder  shall be required to  contribute  an amount  greater than the dollar
amount by which the  proceeds  received  by such  Holder  with  respect to the sale of any  Registrable  Securities
exceeds the amount of damages  which such Holder has  otherwise  paid or been  required to pay by reason of any and
all untrue or alleged  untrue  statements of material fact or omissions or alleged  omissions of material fact made
in any  registration  statement,  prospectus  or  preliminary  prospectus  or any  amendment  thereof or supplement
thereto related to such sale of Registrable Securities.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (d)  &nbsp;    <U>Conduct of Indemnification  Proceedings</U>.  Any Person entitled to  indemnification  hereunder will
(i) give  prompt  notice to the  indemnifying  party of any claim with  respect  to which it seeks  indemnification
(provided  that the failure to give such notice shall not limit the right of such Person  except to the extent that
the indemnifying  party is materially  prejudiced  thereby) and (ii) permit such  indemnifying  party to assume the
defense of such claim with counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the indemnified party;  provided,  however, that any
Person entitled to  indemnification  hereunder has the right to employ  separate  counsel and to participate in the
defense of such claim,  but the fees and  expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such Person and not of
the  indemnifying  party  unless  (A) the  indemnifying  party has  agreed to pay such  fees or  expenses,  (B) the
indemnifying  party has  failed to  promptly  assume  the  defense  of such  claim and  employ  counsel  reasonably
satisfactory  to such  Person,  (C) upon  the  advice of counsel of the  Person to be  indemnified,  a conflict  of
interest  may exist  between  such  Person  and the  indemnifying  party  with  respect  to such  claims or (D) the
indemnified  party's  counsel  shall have advised the  indemnified  party that there are defenses  available to the
indemnified  party that are different  from or in addition to those  available to the  indemnifying  party and that
the indemnifying  party is not able to assert on behalf of or in the name of the indemnified  party (in which case,
if the Person  notifies the  indemnifying  party in writing that such Person elects to employ  separate  counsel at
the expense of the  indemnifying  party,  the  indemnifying  party will not have the right to assume the defense of
such claim on behalf of such Person).  If such defense is not assumed by the  indemnifying  party, the indemnifying
party will not be subject to any liability for any  settlement  made without its consent (but such consent will not
be unreasonably  withheld).  Unless  otherwise  consented to by the indemnified  party in writing,  no indemnifying
party  will  consent  to  entry of any  judgment  or  enter  into  any  settlement  that  does  not  include  as an
unconditional  term thereof the giving to all such  indemnified  parties of a full and  unconditional  release from
all  liability in respect to such claim or  litigation.  Any  indemnifying  party who is not entitled to, or elects
not to,  assume the defense of a claim will not be  obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
for all parties  indemnified by such  indemnifying  party with respect to such claim. As used in this Section,  the
terms  "indemnifying  party,"  "indemnified  party" and other terms of similar  import are intended to include only
the Company (and its officers,  directors,  employees and each Control Person of the Company as set forth above) on
the one hand,  and the Holders (and their  officers,  directors,  agents  (including  without  limitation  counsel)
employees and each Control Person of each Holder as set forth above) on the other hand, as applicable.

Agreement  shall be binding  upon and accrue to the benefit of the parties  hereto and their  respective  heirs and

connection  with the  transfer of less than all its  Registrable  Shares to another  Holder,  the Holder shall also
retain his rights with respect to its remaining Registrable Shares.

</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         1. &nbsp;      <B>Acknowledgments by Affiliate</B>.  Affiliate  acknowledges and understands that the  representations,
warranties and covenants  made by Affiliate set forth in this  Agreement  will be relied upon by Parent,  Frontier,
Holly, and their  respective  affiliates and counsel,  and that  substantial  losses and damages may be incurred by
such persons if  Affiliate's  representations,  warranties or covenants are breached.  Affiliate has carefully read
this  Agreement  and the Merger  Agreement and has  consulted  with such legal  counsel and  financial  advisers as
Affiliate has deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         2.  &nbsp;     <B>Compliance with Rule 145 and the Act</B>.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (a)&nbsp;      Affiliate  has been advised that (i) the issuance of shares of Parent  Common Stock in connection
with the Frontier  Merger is expected to be effected  pursuant to a Registration  Statement filed by Parent on Form
S-4, and the resale of such shares will be subject to the  restrictions  set forth in Rule 145 under the Act unless
such  shares  are  otherwise  transferred  pursuant  to an  effective  registration  statement  under the Act or an
appropriate  exemption  from  registration,  and (ii)  Affiliate  may be deemed  to be an  affiliate  of  Frontier.
Affiliate  accordingly  agrees not to sell,  pledge,  transfer or otherwise  dispose of any shares of Parent Common
Stock issued to Affiliate in the Merger,  unless (i) such sale,  pledge,  transfer or other  disposition is made in
conformity with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Act, (ii) such sale,  pledge,  transfer or other disposition
is made pursuant to an effective  registration  statement  under the Act, or (iii)  Affiliate  delivers to Parent a
written  opinion of counsel,  in form and substance  reasonably  acceptable to Parent to the effect that such sale,
pledge, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3><B>&#147;THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION TO WHICH
RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES, AND MAY ONLY BE
TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145, PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER
IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.&#148;</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The legend set forth above
shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute certificate without such legend),
and Parent shall so instruct its transfer agent, if a registration statement
respecting the sale of the shares has been declared effective under the Act or
if Affiliate delivers to Parent (i)&#160;satisfactory written evidence that the
shares have been sold in compliance with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute
certificate will be issued in the name of the transferee), or (ii)&#160;an
opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent to the
effect that sale of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to
Rule 145. </FONT></P>
