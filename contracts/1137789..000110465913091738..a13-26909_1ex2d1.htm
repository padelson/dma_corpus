 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the Merger Agreement and the Companies Act, at the
Effective Time, the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser will
cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving entity of the Merger
(the " _Surviving Company_ "). The parties acknowledge and agree that (x) the
Merger will be effected so as to constitute a "merger" as such term is
understood under the Laws of Bermuda and (y) the Surviving Company will be
deemed to be a "surviving company" in accordance with Section 104H of the
Companies Act. Pursuant to Section 109(2) of the Companies Act, from and after
the Effective Time: (i) the Merger of the Company and the Purchaser and the
vesting of their undertakings, property and liabilities in the Surviving
Company will become effective; (ii) the Surviving Company will continue to be
liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the Company and the
Purchaser; (iii) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to
prosecution will be unaffected; (iv) any civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding pending by or against the Company or the Purchaser may
continue to be prosecuted by or against the Surviving Company; (v) a
conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, the
Company or the Purchaser may be enforced by or against the Surviving Company;
(vi) the Certificate of Merger will be deemed to be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company; (vii) the Registrar of Companies in
Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") will strike the Purchaser off the register; and
(viii) the cessation of the Purchaser will not be a winding up within Part
XIII of the Companies Act.

 



 

(b) The Company and the Surviving Company will take all necessary action such
that, at the Effective Time, the bye-laws of the Surviving Company will be
amended so as to read in their entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_
hereto, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
will, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the bye-laws of the
Surviving Company until their respective successors have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the bye-laws of the Surviving Company. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective
Time, will continue as the officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold
office in accordance with the bye-laws of the Surviving Company until their
respective successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with bye-laws
of the Surviving Company.

 



 

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or Parent
determines or is advised that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or the Purchaser
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result

 



      
 

 



 

of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Company shall
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the
Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and take and do, in the name and on behalf of each
of such companies or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be
specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no later
than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. On the
Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in
writing, Parent, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement, the Purchaser and the Company will cause (a) the Merger Agreement
to be executed and delivered and (b) an application for registration of the
Surviving Company (the " _Merger Application_ ") to be prepared, executed and
delivered to the Registrar as provided under Section 108 of the Companies Act.
The Merger will become effective on the date (the " _Effective Time_ ") shown
on the certificate of merger issued by the Registrar (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of the Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, payable to the holder in cash, without interest, upon surrender
of such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. At the Effective Time, all
of the Shares will cease to be issued and outstanding, will be cancelled and
will cease to exist, and each Certificate (as defined below) that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any of the Shares (other than Shares
to be cancelled or converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other
than Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 2.3_) will thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, will be cancelled and will cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any Company Subsidiary holds Shares in an employee benefit
trust for the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such
Shares will be treated the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to
the same conditions of, the Shares described in _Section 2.1(a)_; provided,
further, that to the extent any Company U.K. Plan Options have been granted
over Shares held by a Company Subsidiary in an employee benefit trust for the
benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, then such Shares
shall be converted into and become that number of common shares, par value
U.S. $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company, equal to the number of Shares
held by such Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time for use pursuant
to the exercise of such options during the six month period immediately
following the Effective Time. If any Company

 



      
 

 



 

U.K. Plan Options are exercised over shares in the Surviving Company held by a
Company Subsidiary in an employee benefit trust for the benefit of employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the six-month period immediately
following the Effective Time, then such shares shall be transferred to Parent
in exchange for the Merger Consideration, and if any shares in the Surviving
Company are held by a Company Subsidiary in an employee benefit trust for the
benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date that is
six-months immediately following the Effective Time then such shares shall be
offered for sale and transferred to Parent or, if Parent declines to purchase
such shares, repurchased by the Surviving Company (to the extent permissible
by law), in either case in exchange for the Merger Consideration or such other
price as may be agreed with the Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) _Purchaser Share Capital_. Each common share of Purchaser, each having a
par value of U.S. $0.01 (the " _Purchaser Share Capital_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and
become that number of common shares, par value U.S. $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company, equal to the number of Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such shares, together with any
Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), will constitute the only issued
and outstanding shares of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the Purchaser Share Capital will be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) _Adjustment_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect the effect of any share split, reverse share split, share
consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue, share dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Shares),
extraordinary cash dividends (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any
dividends declared or paid within the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Shares
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser will deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares will be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement, together with the aggregate Option Payments
and RSU Payments payable to Non-Employee Holders. Such funds will be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending
payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings
from such investments will be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and
no part of such earnings will accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares;
_provided_ , that no such investments or losses will affect amounts payable to
holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement, and Parent or the Purchaser will
promptly deposit additional cash funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the holders of Shares in the amount of any such losses.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
or, unless mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") not held through The
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ "), in each case, which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and will otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender in accordance with
such instructions of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to
the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, and upon

 



      
 

 



 

delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for
each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
will forthwith be cancelled. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through
DTC, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, the holder of
record of such Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal. Upon cancellation of any
Company Options or Company RSUs held by Non-Employee Holders, the holder of
such Company Options or Company RSUs will be entitled to receive the Option
Payment or RSU Payment for each Company Option or Company RSU, as applicable.
All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares or the cancellation of Company Options or Company RSUs held by Non-
Employee Holders will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to Shares formerly represented by such Certificates, Book-
Entry Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will
be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment will have paid any transfer or similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will have established to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not payable. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. Payment of the Option Payment or RSU Payment will only be made
to the Person in whose name such Company Option or Company RSU was granted.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Agreement, without any interest accruing thereon.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the register of members of the Company will be closed and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, then
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of _Section 2.2(b)_) they
will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent will be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
accrued with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or to Non-Employee
Holders of Company Options or Company RSUs, and thereafter such holders will
be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares or cancellation of their Company Options or Company RSUs and
compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest. If,
prior to six years after the Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to
such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares or any Non-Employee Holder of Company Options or Company RSUs has not
complied with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration or Option Payment or RSU Payment to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares or Company Options or Company RSUs will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and

 



      
 

 



 

clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Paying Agent will be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration or any Non-Employee Holder of Company Options or Company RSUs
for the Option Payment or RSU Payment delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct in accordance with customary industry practice as an
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Company will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts (i) will be remitted by Parent or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance
with applicable Law and (ii) will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may
be.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws, any
Dissenting Shares will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and will instead represent the right to receive only the fair
value thereof under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act. If any such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act, then the right of such
holder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting Shares will cease
and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable solely for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company will give Parent (i)
prompt notice of (A) any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Dissenting Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares and (B) to
the extent that the Company has knowledge, any applications to the Supreme
Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with
respect to any demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. The Company will
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such
demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Company U.K. Plan Options, Company U.S. Plan Options,
Company RSUs; Company U.S. Option Plans; Company ESPP_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company U.K. Plan Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall send a notice
(the " _U.K. Plan Optionholder Notice_ "), subject to prior review, comment
and approval by Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, to all holders of Company Options granted under the

 



      
 

 



 

Xyratex Unapproved Company Share Option Plan, the Xyratex Approved Company
Share Option Plan, the Xyratex Share Save Plan and the Xyratex Unapproved
Schedule to the 2001 Approved Company Share Option Plan (the " _Company U.K.
Option Plans_" and the Company Options granted thereunder, the " _Company U.K.
Plan Options_ ") which (i) notifies each holder that upon the Effective Time
his or her Company U.K. Plan Options shall become exercisable in accordance
with the rules of the relevant Company U.K. Option Plans (to the extent not
already exercisable); (ii) invites the holder to exercise his or her Company
U.K. Plan Options upon the Effective Time (if desired); (iii) explains the
consequences of exercising the Company U.K. Plan Options in accordance with
the U.K. Plan Optionholder Notice (i.e., that any shares of the Company
acquired upon exercise after the Effective Time will be immediately
transferred to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration); and (iv)
explains the consequences of failure to exercise the Company U.K. Plan Options
in accordance with the U.K. Plan Optionholder Notice (i.e., that the options
will terminate without any consideration six months following the Effective
Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the holder of Company U.K. Plan
Options has consented to the cancellation of his or her Company U.K. Plan
Options as contemplated by _Section 5.14_ hereof, the provisions of this
_Section 2.4(a)_ shall not apply and the provisions of _Section 2.4(b)_
below shall apply. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) will adopt resolutions and take all other actions necessary and
appropriate and shall cooperate with the Parent to provide that, to the extent
that any Company U.K. Plan Options are exercised following the Effective Time,
such Company U.K. Plan Options will be adjusted to reflect any variation to
the CompanyÂ’s share capital as appropriate and as provided under the Company
U.K. Option Plans and any shares of the Company issued upon exercise will be
immediately transferred to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
to provide that following the lapse of the six-month period immediately
following the Effective Time, the Company U.K. Plan Options shall terminate in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company U.K. Option Plan and no
further Company Options or other rights with respect to shares in the Company
will be granted under any Company U.K. Option Plan. The Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) will take all other actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate to notify and obtain approvals from the U.K. Tax
authorities with respect to the treatment of the Company U.K. Plan Options and
the distribution of the U.K. Plan Optionholder Notice. Any payment of the
Merger Consideration as described in this _Section 2.4(a)_ shall be treated
the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions
of, the Option Payments described in _Section 2.4(b)_ below.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company U.S. Plan Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that (i) the vesting of Company Options granted under the Xyratex 2004 Stock
Option Plan, the Xyratex 2004 Directors Stock Option Plan, the Xyratex 2000
Stock Option Plan, the Xyratex Amended and Restated 2006 Incentive Award Plan,
(the " _Company U.S. Option Plans_ " and the Company Options granted
thereunder, the " _Company U.S. Plan Options_ ") shall be accelerated in full
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company U.S. Plan Option will be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company U.S. Plan Option
will be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company U.S. Plan Option and in full settlement therefor, a payment in cash of
an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares previously
subject to such Company U.S. Plan Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share previously subject to
such Company U.S. Plan Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred
to as the " _Option Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
Company U.S. Plan Options under the Xyratex 2004 Directors Stock Option Plan,
if the holder of Company U.S. Plan Options has not consented to the
cancellation of his or her Company U.S. Plan Options as contemplated by
Section 5.15 hereof, the provisions of this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall not apply
and the provisions of _Section 2.4(a)_ above shall apply. No holder of a
Company U.S. Plan Option that, immediately prior to such cancellation, has an
exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration will be entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled
Company U.S. Plan Option. From and after the Effective Time, any such

 



      
 

 



 

cancelled Company U.S. Plan Option will no longer be exercisable by the former
holder thereof, but will only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option
Payment. Parent will cause the Surviving CompanyÂ’s payroll processor to pay
the Option Payments payable to holders who are current or former employees of
the Company within thirty (30) days following the Effective Time. Parent will
cause the Paying Agent to pay the Option Payments payable to holders who are
not Employee Optionholders (" _Non-Employee Holders_ ") in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit awarded
pursuant to the Xyratex Amended and Restated 2006 Incentive Award Plan (the "
_Company RSUs_ ") will vest and the number of shares subject to such Company
RSU will be issued to the holder of the Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each such share will be treated at the Effective Time the
same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions of,
the Shares described in _Article 2_ above. To the extent any Company RSU is
subject to a deferred payment schedule pursuant to the applicable distribution
provisions of Section 409A of the Code so that the treatment set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence would cause the holder to incur a Tax and/or an
interest penalty under Section 409A of the Code, then such Company RSUs will
be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment of an amount
equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
RSU and (B) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder being
referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "), and any such RSU Payments otherwise
payable to the holder of such canceled Company RSU will be distributed in
accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Company U.S. Option Plans_. The Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and take all other
actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, as of the Effective Time,
all Company U.S. Option Plans will be terminated and no further Company U.S.
Plan Options, Company RSUs or other rights with respect to shares in the
Company will be granted thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each
holder of an outstanding Company U.S. Plan Option and/or Company RSU granted
pursuant to any Company U.S. Option Plan describing the treatment of such
award in accordance with this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

(e) _Company ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, unless the offering period
underway as of the date hereof (the " _Current Offering Period_ ") under the
Xyratex Ltd 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended) (the " _Company
ESPP_ ") terminates by its terms prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause the Current Offering
Period to be terminated as of the last Business Day prior to the Effective
Time (the last Business Day prior to the Effective Time, the " _Designated
Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the shortened Current Offering Period, but otherwise treat such shortened
Current Offering Period as a fully effective and completed offering period for
all purposes under the Company ESPP (the completion of the Current Offering
Period, the " _Final Purchase_ "); and (iii) cause each participantÂ’s shares
purchase right under the Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be
exercised; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses (i)
through (iii) of this sentence will be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. On the Designated Date, the funds credited as of such date under
the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account
for each participant under the Company ESPP will be used to purchase shares in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each share purchased
thereunder will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, subject to
withholding of applicable income and employment withholding Taxes pursuant to
_Section 2.2(f)_. Prior to the Effective Time (subject to the consummation of
the Merger), the Company will cause the Company ESPP to terminate at the
Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, and the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser
that it will take all actions necessary with respect to the Company ESPP so
that (A) no offering periods or purchase periods will be commenced following
or in addition to the Current Offering Period, (B) no payroll deductions or
other contributions will be made or effected after the Designated Date with
respect to the Company ESPP, and (C) notice will be given to participants in
the Company ESPP as soon as administratively practicable following the date
hereof describing the Final Purchase and the termination of the Company ESPP
pursuant to this _Section 2.4(e)_ following the Final Purchase.

 



 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board or, if appropriate, any committee thereof, as applicable, will adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_. The Company will take all actions necessary
to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company will be required to deliver to any Person any Shares or
other Equity Interests of the Company, the Surviving Company or any other
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options, Company RSUs or other
rights with respect to Shares.

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed after November 30,

delivered by the Company to Parent and the Purchaser prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (with each exception
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule being identified by reference to,
or grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section or
subsection of this Agreement and relating only to such section or subsection;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a matter disclosed with respect to one
representation and warranty will also be deemed to be disclosed with respect
to each other representation and warranty to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on the face of the relevant disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such representation or warranty), the Company hereby represents

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Bermuda.

 



 

(b) The Company has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority to

as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties

where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_
") is a company or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (or the equivalent concept to the extent applicable) under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all
requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary,
and each of these organizational and governing documents is in full force and

Company Option or Company RSU was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant
Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, and (ii) no Company Option is
"early exercisable" or features any similar right. The per share exercise
price of each Company Option was not less than the fair market value of a
Share on the applicable Grant Date. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or

other Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
securities obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or
giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding; (ii) no
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter
into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or
other similar agreement or commitment relating to any share capital of, Equity
Interest or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; and (iii) no other obligations by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to make any payments based on the price or value of any

Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (i)
relating to the voting rights of, (ii) requiring the repurchase, redemption or
disposition of, or containing any right of first refusal with respect to,

(g) The Company or another Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly,
all of the issued and outstanding shares of share capital or other Equity
Interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens

Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

 



 

(h) Except for Equity Interests in the Company Subsidiaries, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any Equity
Interest in any Person, or has any obligation or has made any commitment to
acquire any such Equity Interest, to provide funds to,

 



      
 

 



 

or to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person.

 



 

3.3 _Authority_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, subject, in the case
of the Merger, to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company and no shareholder votes or written
consents are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby other than, in the case of the Merger, the
Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and the Purchaser, constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in
effect, affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
Proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company Board adopted resolutions by which the Company
Board (i) determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger,
the Voting Agreements and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act, (iii)
directed that the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and (iv)
subject to the right of the Company Board to make a Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_, recommended that the CompanyÂ’s
shareholders vote their Shares in favor of approving and adopting this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and, subject to the right of the Company
Board to make a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_,
none of the aforesaid actions by the Company Board has been amended,
rescinded, withdrawn or modified.

 



 

(c) The Company Rights Agreement has been amended so that: (i) Parent and the
Purchaser are exempt from the definition of "Acquiring Person" contained in
the Company Rights Agreement, and no "Share Acquisition Date" or "Distribution
Date" or "Trigger Event" (as such terms are defined in the Company Rights
Agreement) will occur as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
and (ii) the Company Rights Agreement will terminate and the Company Rights
will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company Rights
Agreement, as so amended, has not been further amended or modified. The
Company has previously made available a true and complete copy of the Company
Rights Agreement and all amendments thereto to Parent and the Purchaser.

 



 

3.4 _No Conflict_. None of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or the CompanyÂ’s compliance
with any of the provisions of this Agreement will (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both): (a) subject to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Memorandum or

3.17 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) _General_.

 



 

i. _Section 3.17(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all Owned Intellectual Property and registered, filed for, or issued under
the authority of any Governmental Entity (collectively, the " _Owned
Registered Intellectual Property_ "): (i) for each patent and patent
application, the patent number or application serial number for each
jurisdiction in which the patent or application has been filed, the respective
jurisdiction where filed, the date filed or issued, and the present status
thereof; (ii) for each trademark, tradename or service mark that is
registered, for which a pending application for registration has been filed,
the application serial number or registration number, the jurisdiction where
filed, the date filed or granted, and the class of goods covered, in each
case, if applicable; (iii) for each copyrighted work for which a registration
has been filed, the registration number, date of registration and the
jurisdiction in which the copyright has been filed; and (iv) for each URL or
internet domain name, the name of the registrar and date of registration.

 



 

ii. Since November 30, 2010, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has received any written claim of invalidity with respect to any Owned
Registered Intellectual Property. All necessary registration, maintenance and
renewal fees due prior to the effective date of this Agreement in connection
with such Owned Registered Intellectual Property have been paid and all
necessary documents and certifications have been filed with the relevant
Governmental Entity for the purposes of maintaining, perfecting or preserving
or renewing any Owned Registered Intellectual Property.

 



 

(b) _Licenses From Third Parties_. _Section 3.17(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses granting to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries any rights to material Intellectual Property Rights used
in the Business (" _Licensed Intellectual Property_ "), other than agreements
for standard, unmodified, off-the-shelf software commercially available on
standard terms from third-party vendors.

 



 

(c) _Sufficiency_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or have valid
rights to use all material Intellectual Property Rights that are used in the
conduct of the Business (collectively referred to herein as the " _Material
Intellectual Property_ "). To the knowledge of the Company, the Material
Intellectual Property constitutes all material Intellectual Property Rights
used in the conduct of the Business. Nothing in this subsection (c) will be
deemed a representation or warranty of non-infringement of third party
Intellectual Property Rights, which is addressed by _Section 3.17(e)_.

 



 

(d) _Ownership_. The Company or a Company Subsidiary exclusively owns the
Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of Liens (other than Permitted
Liens). The Company and each Company SubsidiaryÂ’s rights in and to the Owned
Intellectual Property will not be materially

 



      
 

 



 

adversely altered, and no license to Licensed Intellectual Property will
terminate or expire, or be adversely modified in any material respect, in each
case by reason of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) _Absence of Claims; Non-infringement_. The CompanyÂ’s and the Company
SubsidiaryÂ’s operation of the Business does not infringe or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, violate any material right of any
Person (including any right to privacy or publicity), or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction. Since
November 30, 2010, to the knowledge of the Company, no Proceedings have been
instituted or are pending or threatened against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, that challenge the CompanyÂ’s or any Company SubsidiaryÂ’s ownership
of Owned Intellectual Property or right to use the Licensed Intellectual
Property, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. To the knowledge of the Company, since November 30, 2010, no
interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, or other similar proceeding
is or has been pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in
which the scope, validity, or enforceability of any of the Owned Intellectual
Property is being or has been, contested or challenged, except as would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since November 30,
2010, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
claim of invalidity, unenforceability or conflicting ownership rights with
respect to the Owned Intellectual Property (excluding, for clarity, all
correspondence with patent authorities with respect to ordinary course patent
prosecution activities), or any misappropriation of any other PersonÂ’s Trade
Secrets by the research, development, manufacture, use, distribution or sale
of any Company Product, except as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Owned Intellectual Property is not subject
to any outstanding Order of an arbitrator or court or other Governmental
Entity or settlement agreement, forbearance to sue, consent, stipulation or
similar obligation affecting adversely the rights of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect thereto (excluding communications and
decisions made in the ordinary course of patent prosecution), except as would
not reasonably be expected to be, material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(f) _Licenses to Third Parties_. _Section 3.17(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists all Contracts, other than non-exclusive licenses granted in (i)
connection with the sale of Company Products in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) non-disclosure Contracts entered into on forms previously
provided to the Purchaser and (iii) Contracts for independent contractor
services entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and on forms previously provided to the Purchaser; pursuant to which
the Company or a Company Subsidiary has granted to any other Person any
license under any material Owned Intellectual Property (" _Out-Licensed
Intellectual Property_ "). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
granted any exclusive license to any other Person with respect to any material
Owned Intellectual Property.

 



 

(g) _Protection of Intellectual Property Rights_. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary have taken reasonable steps to protect and maintain each item of
Owned Intellectual Property, except in each case as the Company or a Company
Subsidiary has elected in its reasonable business judgment to abandon or
permit to lapse a registration or application, and as would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has (i) since November 30, 2010, transferred ownership of, (ii)
granted any exclusive license of or exclusive right to use, or (iii)
authorized the retention of any exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of,
any Material Intellectual Property that are or were Owned Intellectual
Property, to any other Person. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have
taken reasonable steps to safeguard and maintain the security, secrecy and

 



      
 

 



 

confidentiality of the confidential information and Trade Secrets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are material to the Business. Since
November 30, 2010, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has failed
to obtain valid and enforceable assignments sufficient to irrevocably transfer
all Material Intellectual Property Rights for which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has sought to acquire ownership of from any employee involved in
the creation or development of any such Material Intellectual Property, except
as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(h) _Transaction_. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
assignment to Parent by operation of law or otherwise of any Contracts to
which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, will result
in the Surviving Company (i) granting to any third party any right to or with
respect to any Intellectual Property Rights (other than those acquired as a
result hereof) owned by it, (ii) being bound by, or subject to, any non-
compete or other material restriction on the operation or scope of its
business, or (iii) being obligated to pay any royalties or other material
amounts to any third party in excess of those payable by, or required to be
offered by, it in the absence of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(i) _No Third Party Infringement_. Since November 30, 2010, the Company has
not issued any written notice alleging that a Person has infringed or
misappropriated, or is infringing or misappropriating, any Owned Intellectual
Property.

 



 

(j) _Open Source Software_. No Company-owned software contains, includes or
constitutes Open Source Software.

 



 

(k) _Access to Source Code_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has (i) granted access or rights to any of its Source Code in or for any
Company Products to any third party; or (ii) licensed or granted a third party
the right to obtain any of its Source Code in or for any Company Products
(including in any such case, any conditional right to access, or under which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has established any escrow arrangement
for the storage and conditional release of any Source Code).

 



 

(l) _Government Funding_. No government funding, facilities or resources of a
university, college, other educational institution or research center or
funding from third parties was used in the development of the Owned
Intellectual Property, and, since November 30, 2010 no Governmental Entity,
university, college, other educational institution or research center has made
any such claim regarding the Owned Intellectual Property.

 



 

(m) _Standards_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
participated in, participates in, is or was a member, has made any submission
or suggestion to, or is subject to any Contract with, any formal or informal
organization, body or group that is involved in setting, proposing, publishing
or developing industry standards or which places any restrictions on, or
requirement with respect to, the licensing or enforcement of any of
Intellectual Property Rights, such that the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has agreed to, or, to the knowledge of the Company, is otherwise obligated or
required to, license any Owned Intellectual Property to any third party on
RAND, FRAND or ZRAND terms.

Company or any Company Subsidiary have been timely filed, and all such Tax
Returns are true, complete

November 30, 2010 by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company
or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns or pay or collect Tax in
respect of a particular type of Tax imposed by that jurisdiction, that the

(b) _Payment of Taxes_. All material Taxes of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary due and payable (whether or not shown or required to be shown on

GAAP. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) is the
subject of any currently ongoing Tax audit or other proceeding with respect to
material Taxes and (ii) has waived any statute of limitations in respect of
any material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to the
assessment or collection of any material Taxes, which waiver or extension is
currently in effect.

 



 

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any material liability under any agreement for the sharing,
indemnification or allocation of Taxes (other than customary provisions for
Taxes contained in credit, lease or other commercial agreements the primary

consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group for any period or under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law, including any arrangement for group or consortium relief or
similar arrangement), or as a transferee or successor or by operation of Law.

 



 

(f) _Withholding_. Subject to exceptions as would not be material, each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has timely reported and, to the extent
required by Law, withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity

Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any
other transaction

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement, or the CompanyÂ’s compliance with any of the
provisions of this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event, including any termination of employment on or following the Effective
Time) would be reasonably expected to result in the payment or series of
payments by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to any person of an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Additionally, there is no contract to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party that, individually or collectively, (i) would be
reasonably expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) or Section 404 of the Code or that is
not deductible for other federal, state, local or foreign Tax purposes, or
(ii) would be reasonably expected to require the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries to gross up a payment to any

compliance with all terms and conditions of any Tax exemption, Tax holiday or

material respects with all applicable requirements under transfer pricing Laws
and regulations to execute and maintain documentation substantiating its
transfer pricing practices and methodologies.

by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof
(except tangible personal properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the
date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens. Except as would not, individually or in the

Supplier that such Significant Supplier shall not continue as a

 



      
 

 



 

supplier to the Company (or the Surviving Company or Parent) or any Company
Subsidiary after the Closing or that such Significant Supplier intends to

Company Subsidiary any existing Contracts with the Company (or the Surviving
Company or Parent) of any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

3.28 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this _Article 3_, neither the Company
nor any other Person makes any implied or express representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the
Parent or the Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives of any documents, forecasts or other information with respect
to any one or more of the foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit any claim or remedy for fraud.

Interests of the Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Parent and the Purchaser, and assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Parent and the Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and the
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may

(each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the " _Parent Subsidiaries_
") or any of their respective properties or assets; or (c) assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section 4.4_

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading..

 



 

4.13 _No Other Representations and Warranties_ . Except for the

that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than such non-public information or access furnished in the
ordinary course of business unrelated to any actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal), (D) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or Contract providing for or otherwise

and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in _Section 5.3_ by any No-Shop Representative shall
be deemed to be a breach of _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

 



 

(c) At any time on or after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the

withdrawn, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited, initiated,
encouraged or facilitated in material breach or violation of the terms of this

breached or violated) the terms of this _Section 5.3_ in any material
respect, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation

breached or violated (or be deemed, pursuant to _Section 5.3(b))_, to have
breached or violated) the terms of this _Section 5.3_ in any material
respect, (iii) the Company Board reasonably determines (after consultation
with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to
all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that have
been delivered to the Company by Parent in writing during the Notice Period
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_ that are binding and have been
irrevocably committed to by Parent in writing and (iv) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal
counsel) that a failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation with respect
to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties owed to the Company or to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law, then the Company Board may effect a Change of
Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(f)_ unless:

 



 

i. the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the CompanyÂ’s intention
to effect such Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal (it being understood that the delivery of such notice and any
amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice,
update or amendment will not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board
Recommendation or otherwise give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice
will include the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement(s)
and, to the extent not included therein, the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal);

 



 

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation with respect to
such Superior Proposal, the Company will, and will cause the Company
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the
Parent Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

 



 

iii. Parent shall not have made, within the Notice Period, a written counter-
offer or proposal capable of acceptance by the Company that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisor) is at least as favorable to
shareholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal (it being

 



      
 

 



 

understood that any modification to the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, including any modification in price, shall require a new
notice pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) and compliance with this _Section
5.3(f)_).

(a) The Company will, in accordance with the Company Memorandum, the Company
Bye-Laws and applicable Law, as promptly as practicable following the date of

provided that Parent shall not be entitled to request one or more extensions
exceeding 10 Business Days in the aggregate), duly establish a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company

Board Recommendation. Subject to the right of the Company Board to make a
Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_, the Company
shall solicit from shareholders of the Company proxies in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the Company Memorandum, the Company Bye-Laws and applicable Law, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Article 7, the Company shall establish a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting
for the purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with the Company Memorandum, the Company Bye-Laws and applicable
Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time after the date hereof shall
have effected a Change of Board Recommendation or whether or not an
Acquisition Proposal has been commenced, announced or submitted to the
Company.

all material respects with the applicable requirements of applicable Laws.
Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which will have
become false or misleading. Prior to mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto), the Company will provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response and
will, in good faith, consider and incorporate the reasonable comments of
Parent.

the merits any claim asserted in any court by any party, including appeals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
neither Parent nor the Purchaser will be under any obligation to (A) propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect, commit to or effect, by consent decree,

conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Purchaser will be solely
responsible for and will pay all filing fees payable to the FTC, the Antitrust

proceeding.

 



 

(e) Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company will (i) cooperate and

assets, business or company, in or involving (A) capital equipment for hard
disk drive testing or (B) storage enclosures, integrated application platforms
or high performance computing data storage solutions for the enterprise data
storage industry, in either case if such agreement would reasonably be
expected to cause the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ not to be
satisfied or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement will give Parent or the Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause (A) any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement to
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (B) any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ will not cure any breach of, or
otherwise affect or be deemed to modify, any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the party giving notice contained in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the party receiving notice to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to provide any such notice shall not
be considered a failure to perform or comply with this _Section 5._6 for
purposes of _Section 6.2(b);_ and _provided further_ , that the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section
5.2)_ shall apply to any information provided any party pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_.

 



 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby will be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance; _provided_ , that each of the Company, Parent and
the Purchaser agrees that this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Voting

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six months following the Effective Time or such longer
period of time as may be required by applicable Law, Parent will provide, or
will cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company who continue to
be employed by Parent and Parent Subsidiaries (individually, " _Company
Employee_ " and collectively, " _Company Employees_ ") compensation and
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding any benefits derived from awards under any
equity incentive plan).

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate in and entitlement to
benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen
benefit plan of Parent or vesting

 



      
 

 



 

under any equity incentive plan) under any employee benefit plan, including
any retirement benefits plan, severance pay plan, vacation plan, sick pay
plan, welfare benefit plans and service award, of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries in which Company Employees first become eligible to participate
after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent will credit each
Company Employee with his or her years of service with the Company before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that the foregoing will not apply for purposes of qualifying for subsidized
early retirement benefits or to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service or as
may be required by Law. In addition, Parent will cause (i) each Company
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans, (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) for
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each
Company Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plan.

 



 

(c) For the terms of the agreements or arrangements, the Company or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Company to, honor, in accordance with their terms, the employment, severance
and change of control agreements and arrangements that are listed on _Section
5.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) The Company will provide Parent for its review and prior approval, which
will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld, with a copy of any
material written or formal oral communications provided to Company Employees
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Parent in entering into ParentÂ’s standard
documents relating to compensation and benefits in respect of periods after
the Effective Time with each of the Company Employees.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of any
Person, and except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.8_ and as set
forth on _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no provision of
this Agreement will prevent Parent or the Surviving Company from amending or
terminating any Company Benefit Plan or benefit plans of any Parent or Parent
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.8_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties and will not create any right in any other
Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any
Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, nor will require the Company
to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any employee or former
employee of the Company, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in
accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

 



 

(g) If so directed by Parent in writing at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, will adopt resolutions terminating any and
all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day

 



      
 

 



 

immediately preceding the Closing Date. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review of Parent, and the
Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been adopted
by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request. The
Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case as of the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time, except for any such plans, programs or
arrangements that are required to be sponsored pursuant to applicable Laws.
The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent).

 



 

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent
will cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent such Persons
are indemnified as of the Effective Time by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Memorandum, the Company
Bye-Laws and indemnification agreements listed on _Section 5.9(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule with each such Indemnified Person arising out of
acts or omissions in such Indemnified PersonÂ’s capacity as a director, officer
or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) Parent will cause the Surviving Company to
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any Proceedings with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Bye-Laws, similar organizational documents
of the Company Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements listed on _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification of directors and officers of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently
set forth in the Company Memorandum, Company Bye-Laws and similar
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries. Parent will cause the
indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with any
Indemnified Person to continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms following the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid
insurance and indemnification policy, for the benefit of each person covered
by the CompanyÂ’s currently in force directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance (the " _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), that provides coverage
for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time that is substantially equivalent to and
in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than those of the Current
Company DandO Insurance, and for an amount not to exceed 250% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to the current
Company DandO Insurance. Parent will cause the Surviving Company to maintain
such prepaid policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company (i) amalgamates or
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then proper provision will be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or

 



      
 

 



 

entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.9_ will not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person or
other person who is a beneficiary under the Current Company DandO Insurance
without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
Current Company DandO Insurance will be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_).

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable after the Effective Time by, each Indemnified
Persons or other person who is a beneficiary under the Current Company DandO
Insurance and, if and to the extent applicable, his or her heirs and legal
representatives.

 



 

(g) The rights of each Person indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ are
in addition to, and do not in any way limit, any rights such Persons may have
under the Company Memorandum, Company Bye-Laws or any similar organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary, or under any Contract or Law.

 



 

5.10 _Company Rights Agreement; Takeover Laws_.

 



 

(a) The Company will not (i) redeem the Company Rights, (ii) amend the Company
Rights Agreement or (iii) take any action which would allow any Person (as
defined in the Company Rights Agreement) other than Parent or the Purchaser to
acquire beneficial ownership (for purposes of this _Section 5.10_, as defined
in the Company Rights Agreement) of 15% or more of the Shares without causing
a Distribution Date or a Trigger Event (as each such term is defined in the
Company Rights Agreement) to occur.

 



 

(b) If any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business combination"
or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the
Company, Parent, the Purchaser or the Merger, including the acquisition of
Shares pursuant thereto or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, then the Company Board will take all action necessary to render
such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

 



 

5.11 _Parent Agreement Concerning the Purchaser_. Parent agrees to cause the
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

5.12 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. The Company and Parent will

5.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company will promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of, and provide Parent with any pleadings and correspondence
relating to, any Proceedings involving the Company or any of its officers or
directors relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and will keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of any such
Proceedings; _provided_ that in no event will the Company be under any
obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or
similar privilege if the Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. The
Company will cooperate with and give Parent the opportunity to consult with
respect to the defense or

 



      
 

 



 

settlement of any such Proceeding, and no such settlement will be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

5.14 _Equity Plan Matters_. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
executed and irrevocable written consent from the holders of the Company
Options set forth in _Section 5.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each,
a " _Consent_ "), in which each such holder agrees to the cancellation of such
Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the treatment of
the applicable Company Options as provided in _Section 2.4_(b) above. Each
such Consent shall be subject to prior review, comment and approval by Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Act or similar waiting periods or merger control clearances with respect to
any Competition Law, that has the effect of making the Merger illegal or which

void and of no effect, and there will be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, the Purchaser or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
officers or directors except (i) with respect to the last sentence of _Section
5.2_, _Section 5.7_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article 8_ and (ii) with
respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a
result of the willful and material breach by another party of any of its

that for purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal"
will have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_, except that the
references to "20%" or "80%" will be deemed to be references to "50.1%").

 



 

(d) All payments under this _Section 7.2_ will be made by wire transfer of

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company would not enter into this Agreement and
(iii) the Breakup Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Purchaser in the
circumstances in which such Breakup Fee is payable (excluding a Triggering
Event described in clause (g) of the definition thereof). Accordingly, if the

damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including reasonable attorneyÂ’s
fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines suffered as a result
of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation in this
Agreement by the Company, and neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective former, current or future
Representatives, agents, partners, managers, members, stockholders, assignees
or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligations relating to or
arising out of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing

relief pursuant to _Section 8.14_ prior to any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and the
Purchaser (in the case of the Company, by the CompanyÂ’s Board) at any time

of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, after the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement by such shareholders, no amendment may be
made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

 



 

7.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or

Shareholder Approval is obtained, there may not be any extension or waiver of
this Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely

if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.
