 **ARTICLE 2**

 



 

 **PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

Section 2.1 **_Purchase and Sale_**. On the terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, each Seller agrees to sell to Purchasers, and Purchasers agree
to purchase, accept and pay for, the Subject Securities owned by such Seller.

 



 

Section 2.2 **_Consideration_**. The consideration to be paid by Purchasers
shall be (i) 9,400,000 Opco Common Units issued by Opco in exchange for the
Subject Securities and (ii) an equal number of Class B Units issued by KRP in
exchange for the Class B Contribution Amount (the amounts set forth in _clause
(i)_ and _(ii)_ of this _Section 2.2_, the " ** _Unadjusted Purchase
Price_** "), in each case adjusted as provided in _Section 2.3_ (as adjusted,
the " ** _Adjusted Purchase Price_** "), which shall be allocated as follows:

 



 

(a) 723,800 Opco Common Units (together with an equal number of Class B
Units), as to the Subject Securities and Class B Contribution Amount of
Phillips I;

 



 

(b) 3,318,200 Opco Common Units (together with an equal number of Class B
Units), as to the Subject Securities and Class B Contribution Amount of
Phillips II;

 



 

(c) 5,358,000 Opco Common Units (together with an equal number of Class B
Units), as to the Subject Securities and Class B Contribution Amount of
Phillips III;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , (i) that for purposes of calculating the Dollar
value of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the value of the Opco Common Units
shall be calculated by multiplying the number of Opco Common Units set forth
in this _Section 2.2_ by $16.10, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if, at any time on or after the Execution Date and
prior to the Closing, (x) Opco or KRP make any, as applicable, (A) dividend or
distribution of, or payable in, Units, (B) subdivision or split of any Units,
(C) combination or reclassification of any Units into a smaller number of
units of such applicable Units or (D) issuance of any Securities by
reclassification of such Units (including any reclassification in connection
with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which Opco, KRP or any
acquirer, as applicable, is the surviving person) or (y) any merger,
consolidation, combination or other transaction is consummated pursuant to
which Units are converted to cash or other Securities, then the number of
applicable Units to be issued to each Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall
be proportionately adjusted, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in the
cases of _clauses (x)(C)_ and _(y)_ to provide for the receipt by such
Seller, in lieu of any Units, the same number or amount of cash and/or
Securities as is received in exchange for each Unit in connection with any
such transaction described in _clauses (x)(C)_ and _(y)_ hereof. An
adjustment made pursuant to the foregoing shall become effective immediately
after the record date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective
immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, split,
combination or reclassification.

 



 

Section 2.3 **_Adjustments to Unadjusted Purchase Price_**. The Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted, without duplication, as provided in this
_Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_:

 



 

(a) decreased by an amount equal to all Operating Expenses paid by Purchasers
or the Subject Company Group (to the extent the Subject Company Group has not

amounts prior to the Closing) that are attributable to the Subject Company
Group or the Assets prior to the Effective Time, whether paid before or after
the Effective Time;

 



 

(b) increased by an amount equal to all Operating Expenses paid by or on
behalf of a Seller or the Subject Company Group (to the extent the Subject

otherwise distributed to such applicable Seller) to the extent earned or
attributable to periods before the Effective Time (without duplication of any
amounts attributable to the Cash Amount);

 



 

(e) increased by an amount equal to the Cash Amount as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(f) decreased by an amount equal to the Transaction Costs that remain unpaid
as of the Closing Date or that otherwise become payable by Purchasers or the

(g) decreased by an amount paid by or on behalf of Purchasers or a member of
the Subject Company Group on or after the Closing to reduce or eliminate
Subject Company Indebtedness existing as of the Closing;

 



 

(h) increased by the amount of all Post-Effective Time Company Taxes that are
paid or otherwise economically borne by (i) a member of the Subject Company

(i) decreased by the amount of all Pre-Effective Time Company Taxes (other

provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed upon in writing

applicable Parties in writing. When available, actual figures will be used for
the adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price at the Closing. To the extent

whether such amounts are received prior to, on or after the Closing Date (" **
_Seller Entitlements_** "), (B) Sellers shall be responsible for (and entitled
to any refunds with respect to) all Operating Expenses (to the extent the

Section 2.5 **_Closing Payment and Post-Closing Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall prepare and deliver to Purchasers, a draft preliminary settlement
statement (" ** _Preliminary Settlement Statement_** ") setting forth (i)
Sellers good faith estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price as of the Closing
Date after giving effect to all adjustments set forth in _Section 2.3_ and
the wiring instructions for such Sellers to receive disbursements at the
Closing, if applicable. Each Seller shall supply to Purchasers reasonable
documentation in the possession of such Seller or any of its Affiliates to
support the items for which adjustments are proposed or made in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Sellers and a brief explanation
of any such adjustments and the reasons therefor. Within three (3) Business
Days after receipt of Sellers draft Preliminary Settlement Statement,
Purchasers will deliver to Sellers a written report containing all changes
that Purchasers propose to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if
any, together with a brief explanation of any such changes, and the Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the Preliminary
Settlement Statement. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by
the Parties, will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at the
Closing as provided in _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_; _provided_ , that if
the Parties cannot agree on all adjustments set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement prior to the Closing for the purpose of determining the
Closing Payment, Sellers draft of the Preliminary Settlement Statement shall
govern.

 



 

(b) On or before the date that is the later of (i) ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date and (ii) five (5) Business Days after the date on which the
Parties finally determine or the applicable Title Arbitration Panel finally
determines all Defect Amounts under _Section 3.5_, Purchasers shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a draft final settlement statement (" ** _Final
Settlement Statement_** ") setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment under _Section
2.3_, based on the most recent actual figures for each adjustment. Purchasers
shall, at Sellers reasonable request, supply to Sellers reasonable
documentation in the possession of such Purchasers or their Affiliates to
support the final figures (and reasonable access to Purchasers personnel,
including internal accountants, during normal business hours). Within twenty
(20) days following receipt of Purchasers statement hereunder, Sellers shall
deliver to Purchasers a written report containing any changes that Sellers
propose be made in such statement. Any changes not so specified in such
written report shall be deemed waived and Purchasers determinations with
respect to all such elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not
addressed specifically in such report shall prevail. If Sellers fail to timely
deliver a written report to Purchasers containing changes Sellers propose to
be made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as
delivered by Purchasers will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon
by the Parties, and will, without limiting _Section 11.3(d)_ or Purchasers
right to indemnity under _Section 13.2_ for Seller Taxes, be final and
binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration.
Purchasers may deliver a written report to Sellers during the same twenty (20)
day period reflecting any changes that Purchasers propose to be made in such
statement as a result of additional information received after the statement
was prepared. The Parties shall undertake to use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no
later than thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt of Purchasers
statement delivered hereunder. In the event that the Parties cannot reach
agreement as to the Final Settlement Statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price
following such period of time, either Party may refer the items of adjustment
which are in dispute (and only such items in dispute)

 



     

 

 



 

of a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm or consulting firm
otherwise mutually acceptable to both Purchasers and Sellers (the " **
_Accounting Referee_** ") for review and final determination by arbitration.
The Accounting Referee shall conduct the arbitration proceedings on a
confidential basis and in Houston, Texas, in accordance with the AAA Rules, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section 2.5_.
The Accounting Referees determination shall be made within ten (10) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and, without limiting _Section
11.3(d)_ or Purchasers right to indemnity under _Section 13.2_ for Seller
Taxes, shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In
determining the amount of any adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, the
Accounting Referee shall be bound by the terms of _Section 2.3_ and may not
increase the Adjusted Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by
Sellers nor decrease the Adjusted Purchase Price more than the decrease
proposed by Purchasers, as applicable. The Accounting Referee shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of
Adjusted Purchase Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest (except to the extent expressly provided for in this
_Section 2.5_) or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Sellers
and Purchasers shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Sellers and Purchasers shall each bear one-half of the
fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee. Within five (5) Business
Days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Sellers ten (10) day review
period without delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on which the
Parties or the Accounting Referee finally determines the Adjusted Purchase
Price, (A) Purchasers shall pay to such applicable Sellers, in cash, the
amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment or (B)
such applicable Sellers shall pay to Purchasers, in cash, the amount by which
the Closing Payment exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable.

 



 

(c) Each Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Purchasers in preparation of the final settlement of the Adjusted Purchase
Price under this _Section 2.5_ by furnishing invoices, receipts, reasonable
access to personnel and such other assistance as may be reasonably requested
by Purchasers to facilitate such process post-Closing.

 



 

(d) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Sellers shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to such bank and
account as may be specified by such applicable Sellers in writing. All
payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchasers or any member of the
Purchaser Group shall be made by electronic transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank and account as may be specified by Purchasers in writing.

 



 

(e) All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall be
without duplication of any other amounts paid, credited, debited or received
under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.6 **_Allocation of Purchase Price; Tax Treatment_**.

 



 

(a) Each Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchasers, within sixty (60)
days after the final determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price, an
allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price of such Seller for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes (and any other items properly treated as consideration for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes) among the Assets of the Subject Company of
such Seller in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and, to the extent allowed under
applicable federal Income Tax Laws, in

 



     

 

 



 

a manner consistent with the Allocated Values (the " ** _Allocation_** ").
Purchasers shall have twenty (20) days from the receipt of any Allocation or
any update thereto to review and comment on the Allocation. If Purchasers
dispute any items in any proposed Allocation, the applicable Seller and
Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on such
Allocation within twenty (20) days after receipt of any written changes
proposed by Purchasers. If such Seller and Purchasers are unable to agree upon
such Allocation within such twenty-day period, then any disputed items in such
Allocation shall be resolved under the procedures described in _Section
2.5(b)_. Once Purchasers and any Seller agree to the Allocation or the
Allocation is determined by the Accounting Referee, as applicable, such Seller
and Purchasers shall report consistently with such Allocation (as revised to
take into account subsequent adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase Price) in
all Tax Returns and neither such Seller nor Purchasers shall take any position
in any return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party
shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate,
compromise, and/or settle any Tax audit, claim, or similar proceeding in
connection with such allocation.

 



 

(b) Except as the Parties may agree otherwise, cooperating in good faith, for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes (and for purposes of state and local Income
Taxes that incorporate the federal Income Tax provisions referenced in this
_Section 2.6(b)_), each Seller and Purchasers agree that (i) each Seller
shall be treated as transferring the Assets of the Subject Company of such
Seller to Opco in exchange for Opco Common Units as a contribution described
in Section 721 of the Code, to the extent applicable, and (ii) any payment of
cash to a Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as received (x)
as a reimbursement of such Sellers preformation capital expenditures with
respect to the Assets of the Subject Company of such Seller within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d), to the extent applicable, and (y)
to the extent that Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d) is inapplicable, as
a transaction subject to treatment under Section 707(a) of the Code and its
implementing Treasury Regulations as in part a sale, and in part a
contribution, of the Assets of the Subject Company of such Seller to Opco.
Except as the Parties may agree otherwise, cooperating in good faith, for U.S.
federal Income Tax purposes (and for purposes of state and local Income Taxes
that incorporate the federal Income Tax provisions referenced in this _Section
2.6(b)_), each Seller and Purchasers agree that each Seller shall be treated
as transferring the Class B Contribution Amount of such Seller to KRP in
exchange for the Class B Units issuable to such Seller under this Agreement.
Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, each of Sellers and Purchasers
shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, (y) report, act and file
all Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
foregoing treatment and (z) not take any position for Income Tax purposes
(whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the
foregoing treatment.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in the Opco Agreement to the contrary,
differences between the fair market value and the basis of (i) the Assets as
of the Closing and (ii) the assets of Opco (as revalued immediately prior to
the Closing pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(f)
_in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall, in
each case, be taken into account by Opco using the "remedial method" pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d).

 **TITLE MATTERS**

 



 

Section 3.1 **_General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_**.

 



 

(a) **EXCEPT FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _ARTICLE 3_ THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF

Defects asserted in a valid Title

Purchasers of such election. Any Sellers election to attempt to cure a Title
Defect shall not constitute an obligation to cure or attempt to cure such
Title Defect or a waiver of any Sellers right to dispute, or an admission as
to the validity, nature or value of, or cost to cure, such Title Defect.

 



 

(c) _Defect Amounts_. The diminution of value of the Mineral Interests or
Wells attributable to any valid Title Defect (the " ** _Defect Amount_** ")

Interest or Well, that amount shall be the Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) subject to _Section 3.2(c)(viii)_, which is liquidated in amount, then
the Defect Amount with respect to such Mineral Interest or Well shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the affected
Mineral Interest or Well;

 



 

(iii) subject to _Section 3.2(c)(viii)_, if a Title Defect as to any Well
represents a negative discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest
for any such Well and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on
_Exhibit A-2_ for such Well, then the Defect Amount for such Well shall be
equal to (1) the product of the Allocated Value of such Well, _multiplied by_
(2) the a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the Net
Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well _minus_ (II) the
actual Net Revenue Interest for such Well after giving effect to such Title
Defect and the denominator of which is (y) the Net Revenue Interest stated in
_Exhibit A-2_ for such Well; _provided_ , that if the Title Defect does not
affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_ for such
Well throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined under
this _subpart (iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

 



 

(iv) subject to _Section 3.2(c)(viii)_, if a Title Defect constitutes a
reduction in the number of NRIAs as to any Mineral Interest (or portion
thereof), then the Defect Amount for such Mineral Interest shall be equal to
the product of (1) the NRIA Price allocated to such Mineral Interest
_multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the number of NRIAs purported to be
included in such Mineral Interest as set forth on _Exhibit A-1_, _minus_ (y)
the actual number of NRIAs included in such Mineral Interest after giving
effect to such Title Defect;

 



 

(v) subject to _Section 3.2(c)(viii)_, if a Title Defect as to any Mineral
Interest represents a negative discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue
Interest for any such Mineral Interest and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit A-1_ for such Mineral Interest, then the Defect
Amount for such Mineral Interest shall be equal to (1) the product of the
Allocated Value of such Mineral Interest, _multiplied by_ (2) the a fraction,
the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the Net Revenue Interest
stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such Mineral Interest _minus_ (II) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for such Mineral Interest after giving effect to such Title
Defect and the denominator of which is (y) the Net Revenue Interest stated in
_Exhibit A-1_ for such Mineral Interest;

 



 

(vi) subject to _Section 3.2(c)(viii)_, if the Title Defect represents an
obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the
affected Mineral Interest or Well of a type not described in _Section
3.2(c)(i)_ through _Section 3.2(c)(iv)_, the Defect

 



     

 

 



 

Amount for such Mineral Interest or such Well shall be determined by taking
into account the Allocated Value of the Mineral Interest or Well so affected,
the portion of the applicable member of the Subject Company Groups interest
in the Mineral Interest or Well affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect
of the Title Defect, the potential present value economic effect of the Title
Defect over the life of the affected Mineral Interest or Well, the values
placed upon the Title Defect by Purchasers and Sellers, and such other factors
as are necessary to make an evaluation and determination of such value;

 



 

(vii) the Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Defect Amount
hereunder, or for which Purchasers otherwise receive credit in the calculation
of the Adjusted Purchase Price; and

 



 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
aggregate Defect Amounts attributable to all Title Defects with respect to
each Mineral Interest or each Well shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Mineral Interest or such Well (after giving effect to any applicable
adjustments due to prior Title Defects).

 



 

Section 3.3 **_Title Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Title Benefits_. Should Sellers discover any Title Benefit at
any time on or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall promptly, but in no
event later than the Closing Date, deliver to Purchasers a written notice
(each a " ** _Title Benefit Notice_** ") including:

 



 

(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit;

 



 

(ii) the Mineral Interests or Well subject to such Title Benefit;

 



 

(iii) the Allocated Value of each Mineral Interest or Well subject to the
alleged Title Benefit;

 



 

(iv) such discovering Partys good faith reasonable estimate of the Title
Benefit Amount attributable to such Title Benefit and the computations and
information upon which such Partys estimate is based; and

 



 

(v) such reasonable documentation for Purchasers to verify such Title Benefit
which shall include, to the extent in the possession or control of any
Sellers, (1) a copy of the relevant document to the extent the alleged Title
Benefit is a document, (2) the deed or title opinion describing the Title
Benefit in reasonable detail, to the extent the basis of the alleged Title
Benefit is in a member of the Subject Company Groups chain of title and (3)
any other document reasonably necessary for the Purchasers or the Title
Arbitration Panel to verify and confirm the existence of the Title Benefit
Amount.

 



 

The failure to include any of the items above shall not invalidate any Title
Benefit claim if the Title Benefit Notice materially complies with these
provisions and reasonably identifies the Title Benefit.

 



 

SELLERS SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND COVENANT THAT THEY
SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL TITLE BENEFITS FOR

 



     

 

 



 

WHICH PURCHASERS HAVE NOT RECEIVED, ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE, A VALID
TITLE BENEFIT NOTICE.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit Amounts_. The " ** _Title Benefit Amount_** " for any Title
Benefit shall be determined as follows:

 



 

(i) if a Title Benefit as to any Well represents a positive discrepancy
between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any such Well and (B) the "Net
Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well, then the
Title Benefit Amount for such Well shall be equal to (1) the product of the
Allocated Value of such Well, _multiplied by_ (2) the a fraction, the
numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the actual Net Revenue Interest
for such Well after giving effect to such Title Benefit _minus_ (II) the Net
Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well and the denominator of
which is (y) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well;
_provided_ , that if the Title Benefit does not affect the "Net Revenue
Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well throughout its
entire productive life, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this
_subpart (b)(i)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time
period only;

 



 

(ii) if a Title Benefit constitutes an increase in the number of NRIAs as to
any Mineral Interest (or portion thereof) greater than the number purported to
be included in such Mineral Interest, if any, set forth on _Exhibit A-1_,
then the Title Benefit Amount for such Title Benefit shall be equal to the
product of (1) the NRIA Price allocated to such Mineral Interest _multiplied
by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the actual number of NRIAs included in such
Mineral Interest after giving effect to such Title Benefit _minus_ (y) the
number of NRIAs purported to be included in such Mineral Interest as set forth
on _Exhibit A-1_; and

 



 

(iii) if a Title Benefit as to any Mineral Interest represents a positive
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any such Mineral
Interest and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit
A-1_ for such Mineral Interest, then the Title Benefit Amount for such Well
shall be equal to (1) the product of the Allocated Value of such Mineral
Interest, _multiplied by_ (2) the a fraction, the numerator of which is (x)
the remainder of (I) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Mineral Interest
after giving effect to such Title Benefit _minus_ (II) the Net Revenue
Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such Mineral Interest and the
denominator of which is (y) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_
for such Mineral Interest.

 



 

Section 3.4 **_Sole and Exclusive Remedies for Title Defects and Title
Benefits_**. Except with respect to the remedies for any breach of the
provisions of this _Article 3_, the Special Warranty of Title set forth in
_Section 3.6_ below, the certificate to be delivered at the Closing pursuant

9.1(d)_ or _Section 9.2(d)_, as applicable, disputes as to the interpretation
and effect of this _Article 3_ and all Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts,
Title Defects or Defect Amounts in dispute with respect to each Mineral
Interest or each Well located within a particular state shall be submitted to
a three-person panel of title attorneys (with respect to each such state, the
" ** _Title Arbitration Panel_** "), each of which shall have at least ten
(10) years experience in oil and gas titles in such state (each such title
attorney with respect to each such state, a " ** _Title Referee_** ").
Purchasers shall appoint one (1) Title Referee to sit on the Title Arbitration

the AAA Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
_Section 3.5_. The applicable Title Arbitration Panels determination shall

shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without a right of appeal. Any
decision of the Title Arbitration Panel as to any Title Defect, Defect Amount,
Title Benefit or Title Benefit Amount with respect to any Title Defect or
Title Benefit shall require the unanimous vote of all of the applicable Title
Referees. In making a determination, each applicable Title Referee shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this _Article 3_ and may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the applicable Title Referee are necessary or
helpful to make a determination; _provided_ , _however_ , in determining the
existence or amount of any Title Defect, Defect Amount, Title Benefit or Title
Benefit Amount, Purchasers may not submit any evidence, records, materials,
data or information that was not included in a valid Title Defect Notice

Defect Amount with respect to any Title Defect be any lower than the amount
asserted by Sellers for such Title Defect or any greater than the amount
asserted by Purchasers for such Title Defect or (ii) any Title Benefit Amount
with respect to any Title Benefit be any lower than the amount asserted by
Purchasers for such Title Benefit or any greater than the amount asserted by
Sellers for such Title Benefit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Title Arbitration Panel shall have exclusive, final and binding
authority with respect to the scope of the Title Arbitration Panels authority
with respect to any dispute arising under or related to this _Article 3_ or
any disputed Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts, Title Defects or Defect
Amounts and in no event shall any dispute as to the authority of the
applicable Title Arbitration Panel to determine any such disputes be subject
to, resolution or the provisions of _Section 14.3_. The applicable Title
Arbitration Panel shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the interpretation and effect of this _Article 3_ and any and all
specific disputed Title Benefit Amounts, Title Defects or Defect Amounts
submitted by any Party and may not award any damages, interest or penalties to
any Party with respect to any matter. Sellers and Purchasers shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting their case. Purchasers

statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by it since February
7, 2017 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (all such documents,
collectively, the " ** _SEC Documents_** "). The SEC Documents, including any
audited or unaudited financial statements and any notes thereto or schedules
included therein (the " ** _Purchaser Financial Statements_** "), at the time
filed or furnished (except to the extent amended or superseded by a
subsequently filed or furnished SEC Document filed or furnished prior to the

with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
as applicable, and (c) complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the Commission with respect thereto. The Purchaser Financial
Statements were prepared from the books and records of KRP in accordance with

financial measures, if any, contained or incorporated by reference in the SEC
Documents has been derived from the accounting records of KRP, and fairly
presents in all

 



     

 

 



 

material respects the information purported to be shown thereby. Nothing has
come to the attention of Purchasers that has caused them to believe that the
statistical and market-related data included in the SEC Documents is not based
on or derived from sources that are reliable and accurate in all material
respects as of the date on which the applicable SEC Documents were filed.
Based on an annual evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures,
Purchasers are not aware of (i) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect its ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data or (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of KRP.

 



 

(b) KRP does not have any liabilities of any kind, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, that would be
required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP,
other than: (i) liabilities adequately provided for, reflected or reserved on
the Purchaser Financial Statements, (ii) liabilities that have arisen after
September 30, 2018 in the Ordinary Course or (iii) liabilities that have not
had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Thornton LLP, which has audited the financial statements of KRP and its
consolidated subsidiaries and delivered its report with respect to the audited
consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by reference in
the SEC Documents, is an independent registered public accounting firm with
respect to KRP within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable
rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Grant Thornton LLP has not
resigned or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of KRP
as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with KRP on any matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedures.

 



 

Section 6.8 **_Controls and Procedures; Listing_**.

 



 

(a) KRP has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to give reasonable

(a) From and after the Execution Date, each Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to direct its consultants, accountants, agents and

Seller, cooperate with Purchasers and independent auditors chosen by
Purchasers (" ** _Purchasers  Auditor_**") in connection with the Buyer
Credit Agreement, any audit by Purchasers Auditor of any financial statements
of the Assets or Subject Companies or any reserve reports with respect thereto
or other actions that Purchasers reasonably require to comply with the
financial statement requirements under state and federal securities Laws. Such
cooperation will include (i) reasonable access to each Sellers and the
Subject Companies officers, managers, consultants, agents and representatives

of those financial statements required pursuant to this _Section 8.13(a)_ and
(v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the independent auditor(s)
or reserve engineer(s) of Sellers or the Subject Companies (as applicable)
that conducted any audit of such financial statements to provide customary
"comfort letters" to any underwriter or purchaser in connection with any

Agreement, (y) nothing in this _Section 8.13(a)_ shall require travel or the
obligation to incur any out-of-pocket costs by any of the subject Persons in
order to comply with the terms of this _Section 8.13(a)_ and (z) Purchasers
will make commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption
associated with the cooperation contemplated by such Persons hereby. In each
case, such cooperation by each Seller pursuant to this _Section 8.13(a)_
shall be at Purchasers written request with reasonable prior notice to such
Seller, and no such cooperation by a Seller shall be required to the extent it
could cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached,
cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _Article 9_ to fail to be
satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 8.13_ or any action or inaction taken hereunder, shall excuse or
waive Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions in accordance
with this Agreement. Sellers shall not have any liability or responsibility to
Purchasers or any of their respective equity or debt financing sources with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information delivered pursuant
to this _Section 8.13(a)_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that: (i) each Sellers cooperation pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 8.13_ shall be at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and on the
Closing Date or following the termination of this Agreement, Purchasers shall
promptly reimburse each Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by such Seller, its Affiliates, officers,
managers, consultants, agents and representatives in connection with such
cooperation; (ii) Purchasers shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
from and against any and all Damages by any such Persons suffered or incurred
in connection with any assistance or activities provided in connection
therewith other than to the extent such Damages arise from gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents; (iii) all non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding (1) the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Subject Company Group), (2) the Excluded Assets or (3) any asset or
interest owned by Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Subject Company
Group) that are not otherwise part of the Assets, in each case, obtained by
Purchasers or their representatives shall be kept confidential; (iv) the
assistance described in this _Section 8.13_ shall not require a Seller to
take any action that such Seller reasonably believes could result in a
violation of any material agreement or any confidentiality arrangement or the
loss of any legal or other applicable privilege; and (v) no Seller shall be
required to provide any information to Purchasers for any of their respective
equity or debt financing sources or that is not then in such Sellers or its

Section 8.14 **_No Shop_**. Until the earlier of the occurrence of Closing or
the Termination Date:

 



 

(a) Each Seller and its Affiliates shall, and shall direct each of their
officers, employees, directors, agents, accountants, managers, attorneys,
investment bankers, consultants and other representatives to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to any
Third Party Acquisition or any proposal reasonably likely to lead to a Third
Party Acquisition. From the Execution Date until the Closing, each Seller
shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective officers, employees, directors, agents, accountants,
managers, attorneys, investment bankers, consultants and other

 



     

 

 



 

representatives to, and shall not resolve or propose to, directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions,
negotiations, inquiries, proposals or offers (including any proposal or offer
to their shareholders) with or from or provide any non-public information to
any Person or group of Persons concerning any Third Party Acquisition or any
inquiry, proposal or offer reasonably likely to lead to a Third Party
Acquisition.

 



 

(b) Each Seller shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into
any agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

Acquisition or any proposal for a Third Party Acquisition.

 



 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Third Party Acquisition_** "

Purchasers, will lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option
or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of,
directly or indirectly, any Opco Common Units or Class B Units issued
hereunder to such Seller, whether any such transaction is to be settled by
delivery of Common Units or Opco Common Units or other Securities, in cash, or
otherwise. In the interest of clarity, nothing in this _Section 8.15_ shall
restrict any Seller from (x) utilizing customary hedging strategies that may
involve the pledge of Common Units or Opco Common Units as collateral until
such time as the Common Units or Opco Common Units are ultimately disposed on
or after expiration of the Lock-Up Period, or (y) being named as a selling
unitholder in a registration statement with respect to the Common Units in
compliance with the Securities Act. Nothing in this _Section 8.15_ shall
prohibit or limit the ability of any Seller to effect any transfer of Common
Units issued upon exchange of Opco Common Units and Class B Units (a) as a
bona fide gift or gifts or any other similar transfer or distribution that
does not involve a sale or other disposition for value, (b) to the
equityholders of such Seller or its Affiliates or any of their respective
equityholders, members, limited partners, general partners or Affiliates as
part of a dividend or distribution, (c) to any corporation, partnership or
other entity that is an Affiliate of such Seller, (d) to any investment fund
or other entity controlled or managed by any Affiliate of such Seller,
provided, that in each of the foregoing _clauses (a)_ through _(d)_ , the
transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 8.15_, (e) pursuant to a bona fide third party tender offer, merger,
consolidation or other similar transaction made to all holders of Common Units
or Opco Common Units, (f) pursuant to an order of a court or regulatory
agency, or (g) pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)_ or _Section 13.7_.

 



 

Section 8.16 **_Additional Listing Application_**. As promptly as practicable
after the Execution Date, but in any event after taking into consideration the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange with respect to the
timing of the Additional Listing Application (as hereinafter defined) and the
supporting documents required to accompany the Additional Listing

 



     

 

 



 

Application, Purchasers shall submit to the New York Stock Exchange an
additional listing application relating to the Common Units issuable upon
exchange of the Opco Common Units and the Class B Units to be issued hereunder

commercially reasonable efforts to secure the New York Stock Exchanges
approval of the Additional Listing Application.

 



 

Section 8.17 **_Subject Marks_**. Except as otherwise provided for in the
License to Subject Marks, from and after the Closing, Purchasers and the
Subject Company Group agree, on behalf of the Purchaser Group and the Subject
Company Group, that they shall have no right to use the names "Phillips",
"Phillips Energy", "Phillips Energy Partners" and/or other similar name or
right related thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing, including any
name or mark confusingly similar thereto or a derivative thereof
(collectively, the " ** _Subject Marks_** ") and will not at any time hold
themselves out as having any affiliation with Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (excluding the Subject Company Group).

 



 

Section 8.18 **_Litigations_**. Purchasers shall cause the applicable Subject
Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently pursue and
prosecute the Litigations from and after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 8.19 **_Registration Rights_**.

 



 

(a) KRP shall (i) within 30 days following the Closing Date, prepare and file
(to the extent not previously filed) a Shelf Registration Statement (which
Shelf Registration Statement shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement if the Purchasers are then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement with respect to such registration), registering for
resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities, and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to
become effective as soon as reasonably practicable following such filing, but
in any event no later than the 120th day following the Closing Date. The plan
of distribution indicated in the Shelf Registration Statement will include all
such methods of sale as any Seller may reasonably request in writing at least
five Business Days prior to the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement and
that can be included in the Shelf Registration Statement under the rules and
regulations of the Commission and consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Until all Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable Securities, KRP shall
use its reasonable best efforts to keep current and effective such Shelf
Registration Statement and file such supplements or amendments to such Shelf
Registration Statement (or file a new Shelf Registration Statement (which
Shelf Registration Statement shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement if KRP is then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement) when such preceding Shelf Registration Statement expires pursuant
to the rules of the Commission) as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and useable for
the resale of all Registrable Securities under the Securities Act. Any Shelf
Registration Statement when declared effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply in all material respects as to
form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) Upon written notice to the Sellers, KRP shall be entitled to suspend, for
a period of up to 60 days, the use of any Registration Statement or Prospectus
and shall not be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement,
any related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference if
(i) the Partnership receives any request by the Commission or any other
federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information that
pertains to such Sellers as sellers of Registrable Securities; (ii) the
Commission issues any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or
the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iii) KRP receives any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose; and (iv) the board of directors, chief executive officer or chief
financial officer of the general partner of KRP determines in its or his or
her reasonable good faith judgment that the Registration Statement or any
Prospectus may contain an untrue statement of a material fact or may omit any
fact necessary to make the statements in the Registration Statement or
Prospectus not misleading; _provided_ , that KRP shall use its good faith
efforts to amend the Registration Statement or Prospectus to correct such
untrue statement or omission as promptly as reasonably practicable, unless KRP
determines in good faith that such amendment would reasonably be expected to
have a materially detrimental effect on KRP.

 



 

(c) Each of the Sellers hereby agrees (i) to cooperate with KRP and to furnish
to KRP all such information regarding such Seller, its ownership of
Registrable Securities and the disposition of such securities in connection
with the preparation of the Registration Statement and any filings with any
state securities commission as KRP may reasonably request, (ii) to the extent
required by the Securities Act, to deliver or cause delivery of the Prospectus
contained in the Registration Statement, any amendment or supplement thereto,
to any purchaser of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement from the Seller and (iii) if requested by KRP, to notify KRP of any
sale of Registrable Securities.

 



 

(d) All Registration Expenses shall be borne by KRP. ** ** In addition, for
the avoidance of doubt, KRP shall pay its internal expenses in connection with
the performance of or compliance with _Section 8.19_ of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and
employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual
audit or quarterly review, the expense of any liability insurance and the
expenses and fees for listing the securities to be registered on each
securities exchange on which they are to be listed. ** ** All Selling Expenses
relating to Registrable Securities registered shall be borne by the Sellers of
such Registrable Securities pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable
Securities sold.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, KRP shall not be
required to file a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or
request effectiveness of such Registration Statement (or if KRP has filed a
Shelf Registration Statement and has included Registrable Securities therein,
KRP shall be entitled to suspend the offer and sale of Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement) for a period of up to 60 days if the
board of directors of the general partner of KRP determines (i) that a
postponement is in the best interest of KRP and its unitholders generally due
to a proposed transaction involving KRP and determines in good faith that
KRPs ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially
and

 



     

 

 



 

adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf
Registration Statement, (ii) such registration would render KRP unable to
comply with applicable securities laws or (iii) such registration would
require disclosure of material information that KRP has a bona fide business
purpose for preserving as confidential (any such period, a " ** _Blackout
Period_** "); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall any Blackout Period
or any other period during which KRP is entitled to suspend the use of any
Registration Statement collectively exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any
12-month period.

 



 

(f) Each Seller agrees that, upon receipt of any notice (a " ** _Suspension
Notice_** ") from KRP of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in
_clauses (b)_ and _(e)_ of this _Section 8.19_, such Seller will forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement until such Sellers receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus, or until it is advised in writing (the " ** _Advice_** ")
by KRP that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies
of any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated by reference
in the Prospectus. KRP shall extend the period of time during which KRP is
required to maintain the Registration Statement effective pursuant to this
Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date
of the giving of such Suspension Notice to and including the date such Seller
either receives the supplemented or amended Prospectus or receives the Advice.
If so directed by KRP, such Seller will deliver to KRP all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such Sellers possession, of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice. KRP shall use its reasonable best efforts and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to render the Advice as promptly as practicable.

 **ARTICLE 11**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 11.1 **_Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees_**. Purchasers shall bear
and pay (a) any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, excise
or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the transactions
described in this Agreement (" ** _Transfer Taxes_** "), and (b) all required
filing and recording fees and expenses in connection with the filing and
recording of the assignments, conveyances or other instruments required to
convey the Subject Securities to Purchasers. Sellers and Purchasers shall
reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 11.2 **_Tax Returns_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Seller Consolidated Returns and shall pay or cause to be paid all
Taxes owed with respect to such Seller Consolidated Returns.

 



 

(b) Except as required by applicable Law, Sellers shall prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns with respect to Company Taxes
(other than the Tax Returns described in _Section 11.2(a)_) for all Tax
periods that end before the Effective Time and for any Straddle Periods that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and shall pay or cause to be
paid all Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns. Sellers shall prepare all Tax
Returns relating to any Straddle Period on a basis consistent with past
practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Sellers
shall provide Purchasers with a copy of any Tax Return relating to any
Straddle Period for Purchasers review at least ten (10) days prior to the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return (or within a commercially reasonable
period after the end of the

 



     

 

 



 

relevant taxable period, if such Tax Return is required to be filed less than
ten (10) days after the close of such taxable period), and Sellers shall
incorporate all reasonable comments of Purchasers provided to Sellers in
advance of the due date for the filing of such Tax Return.

 



 

The Parties agree that (i) this _Section 11.2_ is intended to solely address
the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns are filed and the Taxes
shown thereon are paid to the applicable taxing authority, and (ii) nothing in
this _Section 11.2_ shall be interpreted as altering the manner in which
Company Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by the Parties.

 



 

Section 11.3 **_Company Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall be allocated and bear all Pre-Effective Time Company Taxes,
and Purchasers shall be allocated and bear all Post-Effective Time Company
Taxes (ignoring, for purposes of this _Section 11.3_, that such Company Taxes
may be imposed on the Subject Company Group rather than on the Parties
directly). For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " ** _Pre-Effective Time
Company Taxes_** " means all Company Taxes attributable to any Pre-Effective
Time Period, and(ii) " ** _Post-Effective Time Company Taxes_** " means all
Company Taxes attributable to any Post-Effective Time Period.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining the amounts of any Pre-Effective Time Company
Taxes and any Post-Effective Time Company Taxes:

 



 

(i) Company Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons (other than such Company Taxes described in _clause (iii)_ or
_(iv)_ , below, or in _Section 11.3(c)_) shall be allocated to the Tax period
in which the severance or production giving rise to such Company Taxes
occurred;

 



 

(ii) Company Taxes that are based upon or related to sales or receipts or
imposed on a transactional basis (other than such Company Taxes described in
_clause (i)_, _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ ), shall be allocated to the Tax period in
which the transaction giving rise to such Company Taxes occurred;

 



 

(iii) Company Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other similar Company
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated _pro rata_ per day. For
the avoidance of doubt, Company Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other
similar Company Taxes imposed on a periodic basis for the Tax period beginning
on January 1, 2019 shall be allocated entirely to the Post-Effective Time
Period; and

 



 

(iv) Company Taxes that are Income Taxes imposed with respect to any Tax
period (x) ending prior to the Effective Time shall, for the avoidance of
doubt, be allocated entirely to the Pre-Effective Time Period, and (y)
beginning at or after the Effective Time shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be
allocated entirely to the Post-Effective Time Period.

 



 

(c) For purposes of _Section 11.3(b)(iii)_, the Parties acknowledge that
certain state and/or local taxing authorities (including, without limitation,
the State of Colorado and the State of Wyoming), determine the assessed value
of certain of the Assets for purposes of such Company Taxes based on the
production of Hydrocarbons in a prior period (such Company Taxes, " ** _Oil
and Gas Property Taxes_** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree
that any such

 



     

 

 



 

Oil and Gas Property Taxes assessed or assessable by any such taxing authority
for the 2019 Tax year shall be attributable entirely to the Post-Effective
Time Period (notwithstanding the fact that such Oil and Gas Property Taxes are
measured by the value of Hydrocarbons produced prior to the Effective Time).

 



 

(d) To the extent the actual amount of a Company Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Company Tax pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the
most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Company Tax
for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of a Company
Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 2.5_, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Company
Tax that is allocable to such Party under this _Section 11.3_. For purposes
of applying (i) this _Section 11.3(d)_, Company Taxes paid by a member of the
Subject Company Group prior to the Closing shall be treated as paid or
economically borne by Sellers, and Company Taxes paid by a member of the
Subject Company Group after the Closing shall be treated as paid or
economically borne by Purchasers, and (ii) _Section 2.3(h)_ and this
_Section 11.3(d)_, Company Taxes described in _clause (b)_ of the definition
of Company Taxes paid by a member of a Seller Consolidated Group (other than a
member of the Subject Company Group) shall be treated as paid or economically
borne by Sellers.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers
become entitled, pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, to any Mineral Proceeds, which
amounts are received after the date twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
Purchasers shall be allocated and bear all Company Taxes attributable to the
production of such Hydrocarbons or the receipt of Mineral Proceeds therefrom
notwithstanding that such Hydrocarbons were produced prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 11.4 **_Cooperation_**. Purchasers and Sellers shall cooperate fully
as and to the extent reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, claim, adjustment,
litigation or similar proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on or with
respect to the assets, operations or activities of the Subject Company Group
(each a " ** _Tax Proceeding_** "). Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the above, the control and conduct of any Tax
Proceeding that is a Third Party Claim shall be governed by _Section 13.5_.

 



 

Section 11.5 **_Amended Returns_**. No amended Tax Return with respect to a
Pre-Effective Time Period shall be filed by or on behalf of a member of the
Subject Company Group without the prior written consent of Sellers.

 



 

Section 11.6 **_Tax Refunds_**. The amount of any refunds of Pre-Effective
Time Company Taxes shall be for the account of Sellers. The amount of any
refunds of Post-Effective Time Company Taxes shall be for the account of
Purchasers. Each Party shall forward, and shall cause

 



     

 

 



 

its Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a refund of Tax
pursuant to this _Section 11.6_ the amount of such refund within thirty (30)
days after such refund is received, net of any reasonable third-party costs or
expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 12**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 12.1 **_Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to Closing (the date of any permitted termination of this Agreement
under this _Section 12.1_, the " ** _Termination Date_** "):

 



 

(a) by the mutual prior written consent of all Sellers and Purchasers; or

 



 

(b) by all Sellers, on the one hand, or both Purchasers, on the other hand,
upon written notice to the other Parties, if Closing has not occurred on or
before the date thirty (30) days after the Target Closing Date;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement under _Section 12.1(b)_ if (i) the Closing has failed to occur as a
result of the breach or failure of any such Partys representations,
warranties or covenants hereunder, including, if and when required, such
Partys obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at
Closing or (ii) a Party is entitled to and is enforcing its right to specific
performance of this Agreement under _Section 12.2(b)_, _Section 12.2(b)_ or

provisions of _Article 1_, _Section 4.10_, _Section 6.20_, _Section
8.1(b)_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.9_, _Article 12_ and _Article 14_, all
of which shall survive and continue in full force and effect indefinitely). No
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ and nothing
contained in this _Section 12.2_ shall relieve any Party of liability for
willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to any termination, or for
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement that specifically survives
termination hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , such Partys liability
relating to the foregoing shall not exceed $7,567,000. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Sellers set forth in _Section 9.1_ have been satisfied or waived in writing
by Sellers (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, of which Purchasers stand ready, willing and able to
satisfy, and other than the failure of any such conditions precedent to the
obligations of Sellers set forth in _Section 9.1_ resulting from the breach
or failure of any of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants
hereunder) and (ii) Purchasers are entitled to terminate this Agreement under
_Section 12.1(b)_ because the conditions precedent to the obligations of
Purchasers set forth in _Section 9.2_ are not satisfied as of the date 30
days after the Target Closing Date solely as a result of the breach or failure
of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants hereunder, including, if
and when required, Sellers obligations to consummate the transactions

 



     

 

 



 

contemplated hereunder at Closing, then Purchasers shall, as their sole and
exclusive remedies, be entitled to either (A) terminate this Agreement and may
pursue a claim for actual damages against Sellers up to an amount not
exceeding $ $7,567,000 or (B) in lieu of terminating this Agreement, seek
specific performance of this Agreement by Sellers, including the obligations
of Sellers to be performed at Closing. In the event Purchasers seek specific
performance in accordance with the preceding sentence and specific performance
is not granted, Purchasers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
and may pursue a claim for actual damages against Sellers up to an amount not
exceeding $7,567,000.

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Purchasers set forth in _Section 9.2_ have been satisfied or waived in
writing by Purchasers (except for those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, of which Sellers stand ready, willing and able to
satisfy, and other than the failure of any such conditions precedent to the
obligations of Purchasers set forth in _Section 9.2_ resulting from the
breach or failure of any of Purchasers representations, warranties or
covenants hereunder) and (ii) Sellers are entitled to terminate this Agreement
under _Section 12.1(b)_ because the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Sellers set forth in _Section 9.1_ are not satisfied as of the date 30
days after the Target Closing Date solely as a result of the breach or failure
of Purchasers representations, warranties or covenants hereunder, including,
if and when required, Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder at Closing, then Sellers shall, as their sole and
exclusive remedy, be entitled to either (A) terminate this Agreement and
receive the Termination Fee from Purchasers as liquidated damages or (B) in
lieu of terminating this Agreement, seek specific performance of this
Agreement by Purchasers, including the obligations of Purchasers to be
performed at Closing. In the event Sellers seek specific performance in
accordance with the preceding sentence and specific performance is not
granted, Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and receive
the Termination Fee as liquidated damages. If Sellers terminate this Agreement
as described in this _Section 12.2(c)_, upon such termination, Sellers shall
be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Subject Securities
and the Assets, and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the
Assets or the Subject Securities, as applicable, to any Person without any
restriction under this Agreement. Sellers and Purchasers acknowledge and agree
that (w) Sellers actual damages upon the event of such a termination are
difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (x) the Termination Fee is a fair
and reasonable estimate by the Parties of such aggregate actual damages of
Sellers, (y) the Termination Fee does not constitute a penalty and (z) the
Termination Fee shall be Sellers sole and exclusive remedy and shall
constitute full and final settlement of liabilities, costs, expenses and
obligations associated with such a breach of this Agreement. In the event that
Sellers are entitled to receive the Termination Fee from Purchasers under this
_Section 12.2(c)_, Purchasers shall promptly (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days) after the Termination Date pay the Termination Fee to
Sellers.

 



 

(d) Each Party acknowledges that as express consideration for the Parties
entering into this Agreement and such Partys representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein, each Party covenants and agrees that (i) each
Party would be irreparably harmed by any breaches by the other Party of its
obligations to consummate the transactions hereunder as and when required by
such Party hereunder, (ii) monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy
for any violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to a Partys
rights under this _Section 12.2_, (iii) each Party shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunction (without the

 



     

 

 



 

posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) and specific
performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement
with respect to a Partys rights under _Section 12.2_ and (iv) neither a
Party, nor its representatives shall oppose the granting of specific
performance or any such relief as a remedy with respect to another Partys
rights under _Section 12.2_.

Damages relating to or arising out of any individual event, matter or
occurrence for which a Claim Notice is delivered by Purchasers and for which
such Seller admits (or it is otherwise finally determined) that such Seller
has an obligation to indemnify Purchasers pursuant to _Section 13.2(b)_
unless and until the amount of such Damages exceeds the Individual Threshold
(it being agreed that the Individual Threshold represents a threshold and not
a deductible), (ii) under _Section 13.2(b)_ for Damages that exceed the
Individual Threshold for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchasers and
for which such Seller admits (or it is otherwise finally determined) that such
Seller has an obligation to indemnify Purchasers pursuant to _Section
13.2(b)_ unless the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds one percent
(1.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Seller pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and then only to the extent such Damages exceed one percent
(1.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Seller pursuant to

Damages in excess of ten percent (10.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price
allocated to such Seller and (v) under this Agreement for aggregate Damages in
excess of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 14.11_ and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement, Purchasers shall not be required to
indemnify (i) any member of the Seller Group under _Section 13.1(b)_ for
Damages relating to or arising out of any individual event, matter or
occurrence for which a Claim Notice is delivered by a Seller and for which
Purchasers admit (or it is otherwise finally determined) that any Purchaser
has an obligation to indemnify the Seller Group pursuant to _Section 13.1(b)_
unless and until the amount of such Damages exceeds the Individual Threshold
(it being agreed that the Individual Threshold represents a threshold and not
a deductible), (ii) under _Section 13.1(b)_ for Damages that exceed

 



     

 

 



 

the Individual Threshold for which a Claim Notice is delivered by such Seller
and for which Purchasers admit (or it is otherwise finally determined) that
any Purchaser has an obligation to indemnify the Seller Group pursuant to
_Section 13.1(b)_ unless the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds on
percent (1.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price and then only to the extent
such Damages exceed one percent (1.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (it
being agreed that such amount represents a deductible and not a threshold),
and (iii) under _Section 13.1(b)_ for aggregate Damages in excess of ten
percent (10.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Damages with respect to any
inaccuracy or breach (or deemed inaccuracy or breach) of the Fundamental
Representations of Purchasers or the applicable Tax Representations of
Purchasers.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in this Agreement, Purchasers and Sellers hereby waive
any and all rights to rescind, reform, cancel, terminate, revoke, or void this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of calculating the amount of Damages in respect of (but not for purposes of
determining if there has been a breach of any representations and warranties
contained in _Article 4_, _Article 5_ or _Article 6_) any breach of such
representation or warranty, such calculation shall be made without regard to
any limitation or qualification as to materiality, Seller Material Adverse
Effect or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect (each of which instead will be
read as any adverse effect or change) set forth in such representation or
warranty.

 



 

(g) (i) The representations and warranties of each of the Parties set forth in
this Agreement (subject, in all respects, to any exceptions thereto, and the
waivers, restrictions or limitations on such representations or warranties
contained herein) shall not be affected by any information furnished to, or
any investigation or audit conducted before the Closing Date by, any Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) in order to
preserve the benefit of the bargain otherwise represented by this Agreement,
each Party shall be entitled to rely upon the representations and warranties
of the other Party set forth herein, (subject, in all respects, to any
exceptions thereto, and the waivers, restrictions or limitations on such
representations or warranties contained herein) notwithstanding any
investigation or audit conducted or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) before the Closing Date; and (iii) the right to
indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation or audit conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, before the Closing Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of any addition,
supplement or amendment pursuant to _Section 8.6_), with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , (A) that this
_Section 13.3(g)_ shall not extend a survival period beyond the relevant
survival period expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, (B) to the
extent that Purchasers waived in writing the failure of the condition to
Closing set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ related to a breach or failure of a
representation or warranty in _Article 4_ or _Article 5_ and the Closing
occurs, in no event shall any member of the Purchaser Group be entitled to
assert the breach or failure of any representation or warranty of any member
of the Seller Group in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto as a basis for a claim for indemnification or defense hereunder, to the
extent that Purchasers had Knowledge of such breach or failure prior to the
Closing Date and the members of the Purchaser Group shall be deemed to have
waived any claim for such breaches

 



     

 

 



 

hereunder related thereto, and (C) to the extent that Sellers waived in
writing the failure of the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_
related to a breach or failure of a representation or warranty in _Article 6_
and the Closing occurs, in no event shall any member of the Sellers Group be
entitled to assert the breach or failure of any representation or warranty of
any member of the Seller Group in this Agreement or any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto as a basis for a claim for indemnification or defense
hereunder, to the extent that Sellers had Knowledge of such breach or failure
prior to the Closing Date and the members of the Seller Group shall be deemed
to have waived any claim for such breaches hereunder related thereto.

 



 

Section 13.4 **_Exclusive Remedy and Certain Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, except with respect to claims or causes of action arising
from Fraud, the Purchaser Groups sole exclusive remedy against any member of
the Seller Group with respect to any breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and the affirmations of
such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of each Seller
contained in the certificates delivered by any member of the Seller Group at
Closing pursuant to _Section 10.2(e)_ are (i) the rights set forth in
_Section 13.2_, as limited by the terms of this _Article 13;_ (ii) the right
to seek specific performance for the breach or failure of each Seller to
perform any covenants required to be performed after Closing; (iii) the rights
and remedies expressly available post-Closing as set forth in _Article 3_;
and (iv) the remedies available post-Closing expressly set forth in _Article
7_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, except with respect to claims or causes of action arising
from Fraud, the Seller Groups sole exclusive remedy against any member of the
Purchaser Group with respect to any breach of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, and the affirmations of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Purchasers contained
in the certificates delivered by a Purchaser at Closing pursuant to _Section
10.2(e)_ are (i) the rights set forth in _Section 13.1_, as limited by the
terms of this _Article 13_; (ii) the right to seek specific performance for
the breach or failure of Purchaser to perform any covenants required to be
performed after Closing; (iii) the rights and remedies expressly available

with respect to any rights or remedies under applicable Laws to the extent
arising out of such Persons ownership of Opco Common Units, Class B Units
and/or Common Units (as applicable). Except for the rights and remedies
described above and with respect to claims or causes of action arising from
Fraud (it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall limit any
claim based on the Fraud of a Party hereto), upon Closing, each Purchaser, on
the one hand, and each Seller, on the other hand, waives, releases, remises
and forever discharges, and shall cause each member of the Purchaser Group or
Seller Group, as applicable, to waive, release, remise and forever discharge,
each member of the Seller Group or Purchaser Group, as applicable, from any
and all Damages, suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands,
losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, interest, charges or causes of action
whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which any member of the
Purchaser Group or Seller Group, as applicable, might now or subsequently may
have, based on, relating to or arising out of the negotiation, performance and
consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder or
the ownership or operation of the Assets, or the ownership of the Subject
Companies or the Subject Securities, **INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION UNDER
CERCLA OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, BREACHES OF STATUTORY AND IMPLIED**

 



     

 

 



 

 **WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
COMMON LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, ANY RIGHTS UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED
OR UNDERWRITTEN BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP,** **EVEN IF CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE ****(WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT)** **, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL
FAULT OF ANY RELEASED PERSON, INVITEE OR THIRD PARTY**.

 



 

(b) Any claim for indemnity under this _Article 13_ by any current or former
Affiliate, stockholder, member, officer, director, employee, agent, lender,
advisor, representative, accountant, attorney, and consultant of any Party
must be brought and administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No
Indemnified Person other than Sellers and Purchasers shall have any rights
against Sellers or Purchasers under the terms of this _Article 13_ except as
may be exercised on its behalf by Purchasers or Sellers, as applicable,
pursuant to this _Article 13_. Sellers and Purchasers may elect to exercise
or not exercise indemnification rights under this _Article 13 _on behalf of
the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with them in their sole discretion
and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any
action or inaction under this Section.

 



 

(c) The amount of any Damages for which a Party or any member of the Purchaser
Group or Seller Group, as applicable, is entitled to indemnity under this
_Article 13_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance or other Third Party
proceeds, reimbursements or claims actually received by such Party or
applicable members of the Purchaser Group or Seller Group (less the amount of
any deductible paid or costs incurred by such indemnified Party in connection
therewith). Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover
under insurance policies or other rights of recovery for which Purchasers or
any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to indemnity from any Seller
under this _Article 13_. In the event that any member of the Purchaser Group
receives funds or proceeds from any insurance carrier or any other Third Party
with respect to any Damages, Purchasers shall, regardless of when received by
such member of the Purchaser Group, promptly pay to the applicable Seller such
funds or proceeds to the extent of any funds previously paid by such Seller or
any of its Affiliates with respect to such Damages.

 



 

(d) Subject to the terms hereof, each Indemnified Person shall make reasonable
efforts to mitigate or minimize all Damages upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder; _provided_ , that such Indemnified
Person shall not be obligated to expend any material costs or expenses in
order to comply with its mitigation covenant hereunder and any costs or
expenses incurred in furtherance of such mitigation covenant shall be
considered Damages hereunder.

 



 

(e) The Parties shall treat, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income Tax purposes, any amounts paid or received under this _Article 13_ as
an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

 



 

(f) To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this Agreement,
Purchasers and Sellers hereby waive for themselves and the members of the
Purchaser Group and Seller Group, as applicable, including any insurers, any
rights to subrogation for Damages for which such Party is liable or against
which such Party indemnifies any other Person under this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement. If required by applicable insurance policies, each Party shall
obtain a waiver of such subrogation from its insurers.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances shall any Party be entitled to double recovery under
this Agreement, and to the extent a Party is compensated for a matter through
an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price, Third Party recovery or
insurance recovery actually received, such Party shall not have a separate
right to indemnification hereunder for such matter.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of each member
of the Purchaser Group to indemnification (and Sellers obligations) under
_Section 13.2_ (as limited by the terms hereof) shall be satisfied _first_
(i) from the Indemnity Unit Balance of such Seller (rounded up to the nearest
number of whole units) until there are no shares of Opco Common Units with
respect to such Seller remaining with respect to such Indemnity Unit Balance,
_second_ (ii) by the applicable Seller. The number of Opco Common Units and
Class B Units owed by a Party pursuant to any indemnification claim made
pursuant to this _Article 13_ shall be determined by dividing the aggregate
Damage amount owed by such Party upon resolution of such dispute by the Per
Unit Value (rounded up to the nearest number of whole units); _provided_ ,
_however_ , an Opco Common Unit may not be transferred without also
transferring a Class B Unit.

 



 

Section 13.5 **_Indemnification Actions_**. All claims for indemnification
under _Article 13_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) The term " ** _Indemnifying Party_** " when used in connection with
particular Damages means (i) the applicable Seller in the event any member of
the Purchaser Group is entitled to indemnity from a Seller under this
Agreement and (ii) Purchasers in the event any member of the Seller Group is
entitled to indemnity from a Purchaser under this Agreement. The term " **
_Indemnified Person_** " when used in connection with particular Damages means
(A) Purchasers in the event any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to
indemnity from a Seller under this Agreement and (B) Sellers in the event any
member of the Seller Group is entitled to indemnity under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification, defense, or reimbursement under this
_Article 13_, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party of
its claim, including the specifics thereof in reasonable detail (including
supporting documentation of the alleged Damages in such Indemnified Persons
possession and control and such Indemnified Persons good faith estimate of
the applicable claim) of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim
(the " ** _Claim Notice_** ").

 



 

(c) In the event that any claim for indemnification set forth in any Claim
Notice is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Person
(a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the
Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Third Party Claim in such Indemnified Persons possession and
control; _provided_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give
notice of any Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section 13.5_ shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article 13_
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Partys ability

 



     

 

 



 

to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an alleged inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was
allegedly inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(d) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies
its obligation to indemnify and defend the Indemnified Person against such
Third Party Claim under this _Article 13_. The Indemnified Person is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any
motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding
whether the Indemnifying Party admits or denies its obligation to indemnify
and defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this
_Article 13_, then until such date as the Indemnifying Party admits or it is
finally determined by a non-appealable judgment that such obligation exists,
the Indemnified Person may file any motion, answer, or other pleading, settle
any Third Party Claim or take any other action that the Indemnified Person
deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interest, regardless of whether
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced or adversely impacted by any such
actions.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to indemnify and defend
the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this _Article
13_, as applicable, then the applicable Indemnifying Party shall have (x) the
right and obligation to diligently prosecute and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim, if Purchasers are the Indemnifying Party, at the sole cost
and expense of Purchaser, and if a Seller is the Indemnifying Party, at the
sole cost and expense of such Seller, and (y) full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof unless the
compromise or settlement includes the payment of any amount by, the
performance of any obligation by, or the limitation of any right or benefit
of, the Indemnifying Party, in which event such settlement or compromise shall
not be effective without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Person agrees at the cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-
complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Person may participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 13.5(e)_, _provided_ , that
the Indemnified Person may file initial pleadings as described in the last
sentence of _Section 13.5(d)_ if required by court or procedural rules to do
so within the thirty (30) day period in _Section 13.5(d)_. An Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person,
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder that
(A) does not result in a final, non-appealable, resolution of the Indemnified
Persons liability with respect to the Third Party Claim (including, in the
case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified
Person from all further liability in respect of such Third Party Claim), (B)
requires the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates to perform any
covenant (other than payment of money damages covered by the Indemnifying
Partys indemnity hereunder) or refrain from engaging in any activity or (C)
may

 



     

 

 



 

materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result
of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 



 

(f) If an Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation to indemnify and
defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this
_Article 13_ or admits its obligation but thereafter fails to diligently
defend or settle the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the defense against the
Third Party Claim (if Purchasers are the Indemnifying Party, at the sole cost
and expense of Purchaser, and if a Seller is the Indemnifying Party, at the
sole cost and expense of such Seller, and in either case if the Indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the
Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to admit its obligation to indemnify and defend the Indemnified Person against
such Third Party Claim under this _Article 13_, as applicable, at any time
prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify and defend the Indemnified
Person against such Third Party Claim under this _Article 13_, the
Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten
(10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit its obligation to
indemnify and defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim
under this _Article 13_ and (ii) if such right or obligation is so admitted,
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, including the power to reject the
proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Party Claim
over the objection of the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has
timely admitted such right or obligation for indemnification in writing and
assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be
deemed to have waived any right to indemnity with respect to the Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim (a " ** _Direct Claim_** "), such Direct Claim shall be asserted by
giving the Indemnifying Party a reasonably prompt Claim Notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Person becomes
aware of the events that gave rise to such Direct Claim. Such Claim Notice by
the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all available material written evidence in such
Indemnified Persons possession or control thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that have been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Person. The Indemnifying Party shall have
sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages
complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to indemnify and defend the
Indemnified Person under this _Article 13_ or (iii) dispute the claim for
such Damages. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Person
within such sixty (60) day period that it has cured the Damages or that it
disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be
conclusively deemed to have admitted its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Person against such Direct Claim under this _Article 13_. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day
period that it disputes the claim for such Damages, then the Indemnified
Person may continue to seek remedies available to it on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.6 **_Express Negligence/Conspicuous Manner_**. **WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS _ARTICLE
13_ AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT, KNOWN AS THE
EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE, TO EXPRESSLY**

 



     

 

 



 

 **STATE IN A CONSPICUOUS MANNER TO AFFORD FAIR AND ADEQUATE NOTICE THAT THIS
AGREEMENT HAS PROVISIONS REQUIRING A PARTY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF MEMBERS OF THE SELLER GROUP OR
PURCHASER GROUP, AS APPLICABLE.**

reach final agreement or other final non-appealable resolution as to the

the Transfer Agent with the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (ii)
such Purchasers shall deliver to the Transfer Agent written instructions

Notices.

 



 

(c) If following the First Release Date but prior to the Second Release Date,
any Seller and Purchasers reach final agreement or other final non-appealable
resolution as to the Damages alleged by Purchasers against such Seller,

of the First Release Date or otherwise, within three (3) Business Days of such
agreement or resolution, (i) such Seller shall provide the Transfer Agent with

any, that were held back in respect of the applicable claim pursuant to
_Section 13.7(b)(iii)_ with respect to such dispute.

 



 

(d) Promptly after the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (such date,
the " ** _Second Release Date_** ") (but in no event more than three Business
Days thereafter), the applicable Purchasers shall cause written instructions
to be delivered to the Transfer Agent instructing the Transfer Agent to remove

such number is positive) Indemnity Units equal to (i) the number of Indemnity
Units remaining in the Indemnity Unit Balance at the Second Release Date,
_minus_ (ii) a number of Indemnity Units (calculated at the Per Unit Value)
equal to all undisbursed or unpaid Damages alleged by Purchasers in one or
more Purchasers Claim Notices.

 



 

(e) If following the Second Release Date, any Seller and Purchasers reach

transferred Indemnity Units and (B) to remove the Contract Legend on the
remaining Indemnity Units, if any, that were held back in respect of the
applicable claim pursuant to _Section 13.7(d)(ii)_ with respect to such

Purchasers or Sellers are entitled to any disbursements from the Indemnity
Unit Balance pursuant to this Agreement, such disbursement shall be satisfied
by surrendering from the Indemnity Unit Balance to Purchasers or Sellers, as

Purchasers shall be entitled to all dividends or distributions as to all
Indemnity Units released to Purchasers under this _Section 13.7_ to the

by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of

 



     

 

 



 

Laws that would direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction;
_provided_ , _however_ , in connection with the determination of the existence
of any breach of the Special Warranty of Title, Title Defect or Title Benefit,
the Laws of the state where such Mineral Interest is located shall control.

 



 

Section 14.3 **_Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial_**.

 



 

(a) Except as to any dispute, controversy, matters or claim arising out of or
in relation to or in connection with the calculation or determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_, _Section 2.4_, _Section
2.5_ or _Section 2.6_ (which shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with
_Section 2.5(b)_), or the scope, interpretation, and effect of _Article 3
_or the validity, existence, cure or amount of any Title Benefits, Title
Benefit Amounts, Title Defects or Defect Amounts, the Allocated Value of any
Assets or any other matter regarding title to any Assets (which shall resolved
exclusively in accordance with _Section 3.5_), any dispute, controversy,
matter or claim between the Parties (each, subject to such exceptions, a " **
_Dispute_** "), that cannot be resolved solely among the Parties, will be
instituted exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or,
if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over such matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware, and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction in connection with any Dispute, litigation or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby. Each
Party waives any objection which it may have pertaining to improper venue or
forum non-conveniens to the conduct of any litigation or proceeding in the
foregoing courts. Each Party agrees that any and all process directed to it in
any such proceeding or litigation may be served upon it outside of the State
of Delaware in and for the above-specified courts with the same force and
effect as if such service had been made within the State of Delaware. The
Parties further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to
any disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the above-specified courts. The
Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and non-
appealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding contemplated
above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within
or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified or
exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such judgment.

 



 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 14.4 **_Headings and Construction_**. The headings and captions herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to govern,
limit, or aid in the construction of any term or provision hereof. The rights
and obligations of each Party shall be determined pursuant to this Agreement.
Sellers and Purchasers have each had the opportunity to exercise business
discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details and terms of the
transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms length
negotiations from equal bargaining positions. It is the intention of the
Parties that every covenant, term, and provision of this Agreement shall be
construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party (notwithstanding any rule of law requiring an agreement to be
strictly construed against the drafting Party), and no consideration shall be
given or presumption made, on the basis

 



     

 

 



 

of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision thereof, it being
understood that the Parties to this Agreement are sophisticated and have had
adequate opportunity and means to exercise business discretion in relation to
the negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated hereby and to
retain counsel to represent their interests and to otherwise negotiate the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 14.5 **_Waivers_**. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by the application of the express terms
hereof by an instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and
expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No course of
dealing on the part of any Party or its respective officers, employees, agents
or representatives and no failure by any Party to exercise any of its rights
under this Agreement shall, in each case, operate as a waiver thereof or
affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the
performance of such provision. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
no waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of, any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of,
or consent to a change in or modification of, other provisions hereof (whether
or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided herein. The rights of each Party under this
Agreement shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any such
right shall not preclude the exercise by such Party of any other right.

 



 

Section 14.6 **_Severability_**. It is the intent of the Parties that the
provisions contained in this Agreement shall be severable and should any terms
or provisions, in whole or in part, be held invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced as a matter of law, such holding shall not affect the other
portions of this Agreement, and such portions that are not invalid shall be
given effect without the invalid portion. Upon such determination that any
term or provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

 



 

Section 14.7 **_Assignment_**. No Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all
or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights
or duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Parties
and any transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be null and
void. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by the Parties, no permitted
assignment of any Partys rights or duties that is subject to the consent of
the other Party shall relieve or release the assigning Party from the
performance of such Partys rights or obligations hereunder and such assigning
Party shall be fully liable to the other Party for the performance of all such
rights and duties. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 14.8 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY
SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
GOVERN AND CONTROL; _PROVIDED,_

 



     

 

 



 

 _HOWEVER_ , THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OF
TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A
CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND
EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 14.8_.

 



 

Section 14.9 **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended or modified only
by an agreement in writing signed by Purchasers and Sellers and expressly
identified as an amendment or modification.

 



 

Section 14.10 **_No Third-Person Beneficiaries_**. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than Purchasers and Sellers to any claim, cause
of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided
to the Persons described in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 13.4(b)_, in each
case, only to the extent such rights are exercised or pursued, if at all, by
Sellers or Purchasers acting on behalf of such Person (which rights may be
exercised in the sole discretion of the applicable Party hereunder).
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the Parties reserve the right to amend,
modify, terminate, supplement or waive any provision of this Agreement or this
entire Agreement without the consent or approval of any other Person
(including any Indemnified Person) and (b) no Party hereunder shall have any
direct liability to any permitted Third Party beneficiary, nor shall any
permitted Third Party beneficiary have any right to exercise any rights
hereunder for such Third Party beneficiarys benefit except to the extent such
rights are brought, exercised, and administered by a Party hereto in
accordance with _Section 13.4(b)_.

 



 

Section 14.11 **_Limitation on Damages_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, NO PERSON SHALL BE ENTITLED TO LOST PROFITS,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND EACH PURCHASER AND EACH
SELLER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PURCHASER GROUP AND
SELLER GROUP, RESPECTIVELY, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO LOST PROFITS,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OTHER THAN (A) LOSS OF
PROFITS, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES SUFFERED BY ANY THIRD PARTY
FOR WHICH RESPONSIBILITY IS ALLOCATED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THE TERMS HEREOF
AND (B) ANY LOSS, COST, COST OF SETTLEMENT, DAMAGE, EXPENSE, CLAIM, AWARD OR
JUDGMENT OF A SELLER ARISING FROM THE DIMINUTION OF VALUE OF THE PRICE OF THE
COMMON UNITS ISSUABLE UPON EXCHANGE OF SUCH OPCO COMMON UNITS AND CLASS B
UNITS THAT IS PROXIMATELY CAUSED BY OR ARISING OUT OF A BREACH OF A
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF PURCHASERS IN _ARTICLE 6_ OR THE CERTIFICATE
DELIVERED BY PURCHASERS AT CLOSING PURSUANT TO _SECTION 10.3(d)_.

 



 

Section 14.12 **_Time of the Essence; Calculation of Time_**. Time is of the
essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving
any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date
that is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking

 



     

 

 



 

such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day that is a Business
Day.

 



 

Section 14.13 **_Non-Recourse Person_**. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that no past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney, representative,
Affiliate or financing source (including, without limitation, EnCap Investment
L.P., any investment fund managed by EnCap Investment L.P., any of their
respective Affiliates or Fortis Minerals, LLC), and any of the foregoing
Persons respective past, present or future directors, managers, officers,
employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders, agents, attorneys,
representatives, Affiliates or financing sources of any Seller (excluding, in
each case, Seller, and subject to such exclusion, a " ** _Non-Recourse
Person_** "), in such capacity, shall have any liability or responsibility (in
contract, tort or otherwise) for, and each Purchaser hereby waives, releases,
remises and forever discharges, and shall cause each member of the Purchaser
Group to waive, release, remise and forever discharge, any Damages, suits,
legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, losses, costs,
obligations, liabilities, interests, charges or causes of action whatsoever,
in law or in equity, known or unknown, against each Non-Recourse Person which
are based on, related to or arise out of the ownership or operation of the
Assets, the ownership of the Subject Securities, the Excluded Assets or
negotiation, performance and consummation of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereunder or
thereunder. Each Non-Recourse Person is expressly intended as a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 14.13_.

 



 

Section 14.14 **_Certain Waivers_**. Purchasers agree, and after Closing shall
cause each member of the Subject Company Group to agree, on their own behalf
and on behalf of the other members of the Purchaser Group (including each
member of the Subject Company Group following Closing), that, following the
Closing, Vinson and Elkins LLP may serve as counsel to any Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding any representation by Vinson and Elkins LLP of any member of the
Subject Company Group prior to the Closing Date. Each Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and the other members of the Purchaser Group (including any member of
the Subject Company Group after the Closing) hereby, and shall cause each
member of the Subject Company Group to, (a) consents to Vinson and Elkins LLPs
representation of any Seller or its Affiliates in connection with any matters
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) waives
any claim it has or may have that Vinson and Elkins LLP has a conflict of
interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation based
on its representation of any member of the Subject Company Group prior to the
Closing and (c) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchasers, any member of the Subject Company Group or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Seller and/or its Affiliates, on the
other hand, none of Purchasers, any member of the Subject Company Group or any
of their respective Affiliates will object to Vinson and Elkins LLP representing
of any Seller and/or its Affiliates in such dispute due to the interests of
such Seller and its Affiliates being directly adverse to Purchasers, any
member of the Subject Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates or
due to Vinson and Elkins LLP having represented any member of the Subject
Company Group in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Each
Purchaser further agrees that, as to all communications among Vinson and Elkins
LLP, any member of the Subject Company Group, Sellers or their respective
Affiliates and representatives prior to the Closing that relate in any way

 



     

 

 



 

to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client
privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege exists, to Sellers and their
Affiliates and may be controlled by a Seller and each of its Affiliates and
will not, with respect to such privileged communications, pass to or be
claimed by Purchasers, any member of the Subject Company Group or any of their
respective Affiliates. To the extent that Purchasers, any member of the
Subject Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates has or maintains
any ownership of the privilege with respect to these communications, they
agree, except as may be required by applicable Law, not to waive or to attempt
to waive the privilege without the express written approval of Sellers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchasers or any member of the Subject Company Group and a Third Party (other
than Sellers and their Affiliates) or any Governmental Authority after the
Closing, any member of the Subject Company Group may assert the attorney-
client privilege against such Third Party to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by or with Vinson and Elkins LLP.

 



 

Section 14.15 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile, .pdf or
other electronic transmission of copies of signatures shall constitute
original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement and any enforcement
hereof.

 



 

Section 14.16 **_Specific Performance_**. Subject to the terms of _Article
11_, each Party shall have the non-exclusive right to specific performance and
other equitable remedies available at law or equity (including injunctive
relief) for the breach or failure of the other Parties to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree
(a) that each Party would be irreparably harmed by a breach by the other Party
of any of such other Partys obligations under this Agreement and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any such obligations were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and (b) that the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to injunctive
relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies against the
breaching Party to enforce the specific performance by the breaching Party of
its obligations under this Agreement (this being in addition to any other
remedy, if any, to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled at law or in
equity). Accordingly, each Party waives (x) any defense in any action for
specific performance pursuant to this Agreement that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (y) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 **FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS**

 



 

 **[ ], 2019**

 



 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **
_Code_** "), provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must
withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes
(including Section 1445 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded entity (which
has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the
transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform Kimbell
Royalty Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and Kimbell Royalty
Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, " **
_Transferee_** "), that withholding of tax is not required upon the
disposition of a U.S. real property interest by PEP **_[_** I/II/III ** _]_**
Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Transferor_** "),
the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Transferor:

 



 

1. Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury Regulations);

 



 

2. Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

 



 

3. Transferors U.S. employer identification number is **[** **]** ; and

 



 

4. Transferors office address is:

 

 **[** **]**

 



 

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 



 

[ _Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank. Signature Page to Follow._]

     

 

 



 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
Transferor.

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this certification is executed as of the date first set
forth above.

and legal substance of the releases contemplated hereby are not affected in
any adverse manner to any of the Parties. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,

13. _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree (a) that each Party would be irreparably harmed by a breach by the other Party of any of such other Partys obligations under this Release and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this Release were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and (b) that the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies against the breaching Party to enforce the performance by the breaching Party of its obligations under this Release (this being in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled at law or in equity), and the Parties hereby consent and agree to such injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies. Accordingly, each Party waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance pursuant to this Release that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

14. _Representations_. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party that: (a) it is a limited liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under

(ii) purchase, lease or license any additional equipment (including computer
equipment, furniture, furnishings, fixtures, machinery, vehicles, tools and
other tangible personal property) or software; (iii) make modifications to its
existing systems or software; or (iv) pay any costs related to the transfer or
conversion of data of Purchasers; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless Service
Provider can reasonably continue to maintain the Standard of Care, if any
employees that are engaged in the provision of Services cease working for
Service Provider or are reassigned to other work by Service Provider, Service
Provider shall take commercially reasonable efforts to replace such employees
or otherwise to have the duties performed by such employees in connection with
the Services continue to be provided, and that Service Provider shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make or cause to be made such repairs or
modifications as are reasonably necessary to keep the equipment, systems or
software owned by or otherwise in the control of the Service Provider and used
in providing the Services in working order. Service Provider shall not be
required to perform Services hereunder, and shall be excused from any non-
performance of such Services, that conflict with any applicable Law, contract,
permit, lease, order, security instrument or policy of Service Provider or to
which Service Provider is subject relating to business conduct and ethical
practices.

 



 

(b) Purchasers acknowledge and agree, on their behalf and on behalf of the
Subject Companies, that Service Provider and those providing such Services on
its behalf have, and will have, responsibilities with respect to the other
businesses of Service Provider and its Affiliates and may not be dedicated
full time to providing the Services.

 



 

(c) At all times during the performance of the Services, all Persons
performing such Services (including agents, temporary employees, Third Parties
and consultants) shall be construed as being independent from Purchasers, and
such Persons shall not be considered or deemed to be employees of Purchasers
or any of their Affiliates nor entitled to any employee benefits of Purchasers
or any of their Affiliates as a result of this Agreement.

 



 

2.3. _Standard of Care_.

 



 

(a) Service Provider shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Services to be provided hereunder (including any Services provided by a Third
Party) shall be performed with the degree of care, diligence and skill that a
reasonably prudent Person involved in the acquisition, development and
management of mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural

     

 

 



 

gas properties comparable to those of the Serviced Properties would exercise
(the " ** _Standard of Care_** ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Service Provider does not represent or warrant the outcome or result with
respect to the Services, except as expressly set forth herein.

 



 

(c) PURCHASERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SERVICE PROVIDER IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF
PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND THAT SERVICE PROVIDER IS PROVIDING THE SERVICES AS
AN ACCOMMODATION TO PURCHASERS FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT ARE FURNISHED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 



 

2.4. _Service Coordinator_. Purchasers and Service Provider shall nominate in
writing a representative to act as the primary contact with respect to the
provision of the Services and the resolution of disputes under this Agreement
(each such person, a " ** _Service Coordinator_** "). The initial Service
Coordinators shall be Blayne Rhynsburger for Purchasers and Ashley Yates for
Service Provider (or their designated delegates). Unless Service Provider and
Purchasers otherwise agree in writing, Service Provider and Purchasers agree
that all notices and communications relating to this Agreement other than
those day-to-day communications and billings relating to the actual provision
of the Services shall be delivered to the Service Coordinators in accordance
with _Section 7.3_ hereof. The Service Coordinators shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to meet as expeditiously as possible to
resolve any dispute hereunder.

 



 

2.5. _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate with one another and provide
such further assistance as any other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the provision of Services hereunder. During the term of this
Agreement and for so long as any Services are being provided with respect to
the Serviced Properties by Service Provider, Service Provider and Purchasers
shall provide the other Parties and their authorized representatives
reasonable access, during regular business hours upon reasonable notice, to
such Party and such Partys employees, representatives, facilities and books
and records to the extent reasonably necessary in order to perform the
Services. Purchasers hereby acknowledge that the cooperation of Purchasers and
the Subject Companies is essential to Service Providers provision of the
Services hereunder and agrees that, to the extent that Service Providers
failure to perform the Services in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including the Standard of Care, is caused by the failure of
Purchasers and the Subject Companies to cooperate in provision of the
Services, such failure shall be deemed waived by Purchasers.

 



 

2.6. _Remittance of Amounts Collected_. To the extent Service Provider shall
have charge or possession of any of Purchasers assets in connection with the
provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement, Service Provider shall
(a) hold such assets in the name and for the benefit of Purchasers (or their
designated Affiliates) and (b) separately maintain, and not commingle, such
assets with any assets of Service Provider, Sellers or any other Person.
Within five (5) Business Days of the Effective Date, Service Provider shall
use its reasonable best efforts to transfer access and title to all lockbox
accounts and other bank or deposit accounts used in connection with the

     

 

 



 

Serviced Properties to Purchasers, such that Purchasers have exclusive control
over and access to all such accounts; _provided_ , that, to the extent that
IberiaBank does not permit the transfer of access or title of such accounts,
Service Provider shall use its reasonable best efforts to work with IberiaBank
to attempt to find a solution. For the avoidance of doubt, the accounts
described in the preceding sentence shall include, but shall not be limited
to, the accounts described on _Schedule B_ to this Agreement.

 



 

2.7. _Termination of Services_. The obligations of Service Provider under this
Agreement to provide the Services shall commence on the Effective Date and
shall terminate on the End Date (the period beginning on the Effective Date
and ending on the End Date, the " ** _Services Term_** ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
FEES AND EXPENSES**

 



 

3.1. _Services Fees_. During the Services Term, Purchasers shall pay to
Service Provider a monthly fee with respect to the Services equal to the
amount set forth on _Schedule A_ (each such monthly fee, a " ** _Services
Fee_** " and, collectively, the " ** _Services Fees_** "). Purchasers shall
remit payment to Service Provider for the applicable Services Fees for such
month within five (5) days of the beginning of each month; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Effective Date is other than the first day of a
calendar month, then the applicable Services Fees for such month shall be
remitted to Service Provider within five (5) days of the Effective Date. If
the Effective Date is other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the
term of this Agreement ends on any day other than the last day of a calendar
month, the amount of the Services Fees that Purchasers shall owe for any such
month shall be prorated on a daily basis.

 



 

3.2. _Third Party Expenses_. Purchasers shall reimburse Service Provider for
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Service
Provider and paid to any Third Party solely as a result of providing the
Services hereunder (and not otherwise reimbursed to Service Provider,
including under the Services Fees) (the " ** _Third Party Expenses_** ");
_provided, however_ , that Service Provider shall not incur Third Party
Expenses in excess of $25,000 during any month without the prior written
consent of Purchasers, and Purchasers shall have no obligation to reimburse
Service Provider for any such Third Party Expenses for which Purchasers did
not provide their prior written consent.

 



 

3.3. _Invoicing for Third Party Fees_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the end of each month, Service Provider shall provide Purchasers with an
invoice (each, an " ** _Invoice_** ") for the preceding month reflecting (a)
the Third Party Expenses incurred during such month and (b) the amount due for
Taxes pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (collectively, the " ** _Fees_** ").
Purchasers shall remit to Service Provider the Fees billed to it within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the applicable Invoice. By way of example, the
first such Fees shall be due and payable on or before the fifteenth (15th) day
after the first Invoice is received by Purchasers and (ii) the last Invoice
shall be due and payable on or before the fifteenth (15th) day after the last
Invoice is received by Purchasers. Each Invoice shall be directed to
Purchasers Service Coordinator or such other person designated in writing
from time to time by such Service Coordinator. The Invoice shall set forth the
Fees due in reasonable detail for the period covered by such Invoice. Upon
written request, Service Provider

     

 

 



 

shall promptly provide to Purchasers reasonable support documentation to
permit Purchasers to verify the accuracy of an Invoice.

 



 

3.4. _Objection_. Except to the extent such expense or cost was previously
approved by Purchasers in writing (including via email), Purchasers may object
to any expense or cost included on an Invoice, including on the ground that
the same was not a reasonable or appropriate cost incurred by Service Provider
in connection with the Services; _provided that_ such objection is made in
writing to Service Provider within fifteen (15) days following the date of
Purchasers receipt of the disputed Invoice.

 



 

3.5. _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of an invoicing or payment dispute not
otherwise resolved between the Service Coordinators, Purchasers shall promptly
notify Service Provider in writing of such disputed item and the reasons for
the dispute. The Parties shall, during the fifteen (15) days after such
notice, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement within
such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause a nationally recognized
accounting firm agreeable to the Parties (the " ** _Accounting Referee_** ")
to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts. The Accounting
Referee shall deliver to the Parties as promptly as practicable (but in any
event no later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the
Accounting Referee), a report setting forth the Accounting Referees
determination of the appropriate resolution of the disputed items or amounts.
Such determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties absent manifest
error. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by each Party
involved in the dispute.

 



 

3.6. _Error Correction_. Each Party shall make adjustments to charges as
required to reflect the discovery of undisputed errors or omissions in
charges; _provided, however_ , that any errors or omissions the correction of
which would result in additional or increased charges or fees for Services
must be corrected within three (3) months after the date of payment of the
applicable Services Fee or the related Invoice, as applicable.

 



 

3.7. _Taxes._ All transfer taxes, excises, fees or other charges (including
value added, sales, use or receipts taxes, but not including a tax on or
measured by the income, net or gross revenues, business activity or capital of
Service Provider), or any increase therein, now or hereafter imposed directly
or indirectly by Law, which Service Provider is required to pay or incur in
connection with the provision of Services hereunder (" ** _Tax_** "), shall be
passed on to Purchasers as an explicit surcharge and shall be paid by
Purchasers in addition to any payment to cover expenses and costs related to
the Services provided. If Purchasers submit to Service Provider a timely and
valid resale or other exemption certificate reasonably acceptable to Service
Provider and sufficient to support the exemption from any applicable Tax, then
such Tax shall not be added to the Fees pursuant to _Section 3.3_, _provided,
however_ , that if Service Provider is ever required to pay such Tax,
Purchasers shall promptly reimburse Service Provider for such Tax, including
any interest,

     

 

 



 

penalties and attorneys fees related thereto. The Parties shall cooperate to
minimize the imposition of any Taxes.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

4.1. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) PURCHASERS SHALL ASSUME ALL LIABILITY FOR AND SHALL RELEASE, INDEMNIFY,
DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SERVICE PROVIDER, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE " **
_SERVICE PROVIDER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES_** ") FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
LOSSES, RELATED TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) ANY MATERIAL
BREACH BY PURCHASERS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) THE PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH,
DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR LIABILITY OF PURCHASERS OR THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING
THE SUBJECT COMPANIES), ANY THIRD PARTY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES,
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND AGENTS AND ARISING FROM, CONNECTED WITH OR UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, PURCHASERS ONLY REMEDY FOR BREACH OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR ANY OTHER FAULT OF
SERVICE PROVIDER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO _SECTION 5.2_.

 



 

(b) Purchasers will have the right to control the defense of any claim for
which a Service Provider Indemnified Party has a right to indemnification
hereunder and shall reimburse each Service Provider Indemnified Party for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of one counsel for all such Service Provider Indemnified Parties (and
any required local counsel, each to be selected by Service Provider) and any
other litigation-related expenses) as they are incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing, pursuing, defending or assisting in the defense of
any action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding for which such Service
Provider Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification under the
terms of the previous sentence, whether or not such Service Provider
Indemnified Party is a party thereto; _provided_ that the payment of such
costs and expenses shall be made only upon delivery to Purchasers of a written
affirmation by such Service Provider Indemnified Party of such Persons good
faith belief that such Person has met the requirements necessary for
indemnification under _Section 4.1(a)_ and a written undertaking, by or on
behalf of such Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Service Provider Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified under _Section 4.1(a)_. Purchasers agree that they will not,
without the prior written consent of the applicable Service Provider
Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding subject to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ (and to which such Service Provider Indemnified
Party is a party) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Service Provider Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding, and does not
contain an admission of guilt or liability on the part of such Service
Provider Indemnified Party.

     

 

 



 

(c) The rights of indemnification hereunder will be in addition to any other
rights and remedies any Person may have under any other agreement or
instrument to which such Person is or becomes a party or is, or otherwise
becomes, a beneficiary, or under any applicable Law.

 



 

(d) THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST
PURCHASERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT
WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR FAULT OF ANY OF THE SERVICE
PROVIDER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.
