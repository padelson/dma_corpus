---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tReasonably promptly after the date hereof, the Company
shall mail to each Stockholder of record holding a Certificate and to each
Stockholder holding Shares in book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares"), and, in
each case, whose Shares will be converted into the right to receive the
consideration described in Section 2.6(a)(i), (i) a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment therefor. Upon proper surrender of any such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Buyer in accordance with the
surrender instructions, together with such completed letter of transmittal
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (as and when payable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement), an amount in cash equal to (A) the Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, without interest, and

Stockholder's failure to make timely surrender of its Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with the surrender instructions and delivery of the
letter of transmittal to the Buyer shall only impact the timing of the payment
to such Stockholder pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(iii) and shall not impact such
Stockholder's entitlement to payment.

registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related stock
power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Buyer that any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.8, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled
Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable with respect to the Shares represented thereby, in cash,
without interest.

accordance with the terms of this Article II and all cash deposited with the
Escrow Agent and the Equityholder Representative pursuant to this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to Shares represented
thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Applicable Law.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tIf any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof,
the Buyer shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares
represented thereby, in cash, without interest; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a
reasonably satisfactory indemnity; provided further, that such indemnity shall
not require any Stockholder to post a bond or similar backstop security.

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tWithin sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the
Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) a written statement
(the "Final Closing Statement") that shall include and set forth (i) a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the
Measurement Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet") in accordance with the sample
calculation worksheet set forth in Schedule 2.9 and (ii) a calculation of the
actual (A) Net Working Capital (the "Closing Net Working Capital"), (B)

to the end of such period, the Equityholder Representative delivers to the
Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement")
specifying the nature and amount of any dispute as to the Merger
Consideration, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement. The Equityholder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts
included in the calculation of the Merger Consideration, as set forth in the
Final Closing Statement that are not specifically referenced in the Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review in
accordance with Section 2.10(c). Any Notice of Disagreement may reference
only disagreements (x) based on mathematical errors or (y) regarding whether
the Merger Consideration, or the components thereof, as reflected on the Final
Closing Statement, were calculated in accordance with this Section 2.10.

a Notice of Disagreement by the Equityholder Representative to the Buyer, the
parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any differences that
they may have with respect to the calculation of the Merger Consideration.
Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Equityholder Representative
and the Buyer within such fifteen (15) day period shall be final and binding
with respect to such items, and if the Equityholder Representative and the
Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item specified by
the Equityholder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement and the amount
of the Merger Consideration, the amount so determined shall be final and
binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review. If the Equityholder Representative and the Buyer
have not resolved all such differences by the end of such fifteen (15) day
period, the Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall submit, in
writing, to a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm (the
"Independent Accounting Firm"), their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the amount of
the Merger Consideration (including a reasonably detailed calculation
thereof), and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written
determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of the Merger
Consideration, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties
for all purposes hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider
only those items and amounts in the Equityholder Representative's and the
Buyer's respective calculations of the Merger Consideration that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Equityholder Representative
and the Buyer have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall limit its determination to whether the
Buyer's proposed amount for such item in the Notice of Disagreement or the
Equityholder Representative's proposed amount for such item in the Notice of
Disagreement is calculated more nearly in accordance with this Agreement.

the Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and the Buyer. The
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days following the submission
thereof. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will
be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

Firm and of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by
the Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and the Buyer in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each
party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such party.

2.10 shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, afford the Buyer or the

Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and its

preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.10.
Each party shall authorize its accountants to disclose work papers generated
by such accountants in connection with preparing and reviewing the calculation
of the Closing Merger Consideration as specified in this Section 2.10;
provided that such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available except in accordance with such accountants' disclosure procedures
and then only after the non-client party has signed an agreement relating to
access to such work papers in form and substance acceptable to such
accountants.

(B) the Closing Merger Consideration;

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIf the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, (A) the Buyer

(I) the portion of each former Stockholder's Fully Diluted Percentage of the
Net Adjustment Amount attributable to Shares (as opposed to In-the-Money
Options or RSUs) previously held by such former Stockholder, subject to
Section 2.8, to such former Stockholder as soon as practicable, and (II) the

Amount attributable to In-the-Money Options or RSUs (as opposed to Shares)
previously held by such holder to the Surviving Corporation for delivery to
such former holder of In-the-Money Options and RSUs through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system and (C) the Escrow Agent shall pay (I) the

Escrow Fund attributable to In-the-Money Options or RSUs (as opposed to

neither the Equityholder Representative nor any Seller shall be entitled to
object to such claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund; provided, however,
that for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be entitled to seek
recovery of all or any portion of the Net Adjustment Amount directly from the
Sellers. In the event the amount of funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund
exceeds the Net Adjustment Amount, then the Escrow Agent, after paying the Net
Adjustment Amount to the Buyer as provided herein, shall pay (I) the portion
of each former Stockholder's Fully Diluted Percentage of the remaining amount
of funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund attributable to Shares (as opposed to
In-the-Money Options or RSUs) previously held by such former Stockholder,
subject to Section 2.8, to such former Stockholder as soon as practicable and
(II) the portion of each former holder's Fully Diluted Percentage of the

equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by the Wall
Street Journal as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365
days and the number of days elapsed. Payments in respect of Section 2.10(g),
unless specified otherwise to the contrary, shall be made within three
Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 2.10 by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the party
entitled to such payment at least two Business Days prior to such payment
date.

 \t\t\t\t 2.9 \t\t\tWithholding Rights. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that
such amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made. The Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall notify each Stockholder with respect to any
deduction or withholding from amounts that are otherwise payable to such
Stockholder hereunder or under any other Transaction Document (other than any
such deduction or withholding on amounts that are treated as compensation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) and shall cooperate in good faith with such
Stockholder to mitigate any such requirement to deduct or withhold to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law; provided, that any such notification, if
required, shall be made to such Stockholder in writing prior to the later of
(i) five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing or (ii) five (5) Business Days
following the return to the Company by a Stockholder of a duly executed letter
of transmittal pursuant to Section 2.8(a) hereof.

proxy and attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to act on behalf
of the Stockholders for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the
"Equityholder Representative"), including the full power and authority to act
on the Stockholders' behalf as provided in Section 2.12(b). The Sellers, by
approving this Agreement pursuant to the Stockholder Consent, further agree
that such agency, proxy and attorney-in-fact, powers, immunities and rights of
indemnification granted to the Equityholder Representative Group hereunder are
(i) are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of the Equityholder Representative, except as provided in Section
2.12(c), (ii) shall be binding upon the successors, heirs, executors,
administers and legal representatives of each Seller and shall not be affected
by, and shall survive, the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or
liquidation of any Seller and (iii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Seller of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
Equityholder Representative Fund. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Equityholder Representative shall be binding upon all of
the Sellers and such Seller's successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such Seller, and no Seller shall have the right to
object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest any such decision,
action, consent or instruction. The Escrow Agent and the Buyer Parties shall
be entitled to rely on any decision, action, consent or instruction of the
Equityholder Representative as being the decision, action, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and the Buyer Parties
are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction. The
Equityholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon any signature
believed by it to be genuine, and (ii) reasonably assume that a signatory has
proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Seller or other
party.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe Equityholder Representative shall have such powers
and authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Equityholder Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion to
(i) consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (including pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof); (ii) from and
after the Closing, negotiate disputes arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement (including pursuant to Article VIII hereof) and the Escrow
Agreement; and (iii) from and after the Closing, execute and deliver any
amendment or waiver to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and (iv) from
and after the Closing, take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of
the Sellers in connection with this Agreement (including pursuant to Section
2.10 and Article VIII hereof) and the Escrow Agreement. The Equityholder
Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder to the Sellers,
including any fiduciary duties, except those set forth herein, and such duties
and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe Equityholder Representative may resign at any time,
and may be removed for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent
of Sellers holding a majority of the aggregate Fully Diluted Share Number as
of the Effective Time (the "Majority Sellers"). In the event of the death,
incapacity, resignation or removal of the Equityholder Representative, a new
Equityholder Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent
of the Majority Sellers and such replacement Equityholder Representative must
be duly appointed prior to the

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t Representative. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Equityholder Representative shall be sent to the Buyer
and, after the Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation, such appointment
to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the
date such consent is received by the Buyer and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation; provided, that until such notice is received, the
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the
prior Equityholder Representative as described in Section 2.12(a). The
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Equityholder
Representative Group shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Equityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the
Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe Equityholder Representative shall hold the
Equityholder Representative Fund Amount in a segregated account (the
"Equityholder Representative Fund"). The Equityholder Representative Fund
shall be used for the purpose of paying directly or reimbursing the
Equityholder Representative for all reasonably documented expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Equityholder
Representative in such capacity (including such expenses as that are to be
borne by the Equityholder Representative on behalf of the Sellers under this
Agreement); provided, that, other than the payment contemplated under Section
2.7(a)(vii), neither the Buyer nor the Company shall have any monetary
obligation or liability to the Equityholder Representative. The Equityholder
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal
of the Equityholder Representative Fund other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Equityholder Representative is not
acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with
the Equityholder Representative Fund, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Sellers will not receive any interest on the
Equityholder Representative Fund and assign to the Equityholder Representative
any such interest. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tIn the event the Equityholder Representative Fund is
insufficient to satisfy the expenses of the Equityholder Representative,
following the Expiration Date and prior to the final distribution from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Sellers of any amounts thereof in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Equityholder Representative shall
have the right to recover its unpaid expenses from any remaining portion of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund that is then distributable to the Sellers.
Immediately prior to the Survival Date, and from time to time thereafter for
so long as any amounts remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Equityholder
Representative shall deliver to Buyer and the Escrow Agent a certificate
setting forth its unpaid expenses and upon receipt of such certificate, the
Escrow Agent shall pay such unpaid expenses to the Equityholder Representative
up to the amount of any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to be
made to the Sellers in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the
Equityholder Representative's right to recover its expenses under this Section
2.12(e) shall not impair Buyer's right to recover from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund pursuant to Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement and no funds subject to
a pending or unsatisfied claim shall be distributed to the Equityholder
Representative. The Sellers acknowledge that the Equityholder Representative

rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tThe Company and certain representatives of the Sellers
have entered into an engagement agreement (the "Representative Engagement
Agreement") with the Equityholder Representative to provide direction to the
Equityholder Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Representative Engagement Agreement
(such representatives, the "Advisory Group"). It is acknowledged and agreed
that the Advisory Group to the Equityholder Representative shall initially be
the individuals set forth on Schedule 2.12. Neither the Equityholder
Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
"Equityholder Representative Group"), shall be liable to any Seller for any
action or failure to act in connection with the acceptance or administration
of the Equityholder Representative Group's responsibilities hereunder, under
the Escrow Agreement or under the Representative Engagement Agreement, unless
and only to the extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross
negligence or willful misconduct. At such time as the Equityholder
Representative determines that it will not incur any further expenses in its
capacity as such, the Equityholder Representative shall pay (I) the portion of
each former Stockholder's Fully Diluted Percentage of the remaining amount of
funds in the Equityholder Representative Fund attributable to Shares (as
opposed to In-the-Money Options or RSUs) previously held by such former
Stockholder to the Surviving Corporation for distribution to such former
Stockholder, subject to Section 2.8, and (II) the portion of each former
holder's Fully Diluted Percentage of the remaining amount of funds in the
Equityholder Representative Fund attributable to In-the-Money Options or RSUs
(as opposed to Shares) previously held by such former holder to the Surviving
Corporation for delivery to such former holder of In-the-Money Options and
RSUs through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, promptly upon the distribution of the Adjustment Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 2.10(g), the Equityholder Representative shall pay any
amounts remaining in the Equityholder Representative Fund in excess of
$250,000 to the Surviving Corporation for distribution to the former
Stockholder's and former holders of In-the Money Options and RSUs in according
with the foregoing sentence.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tBy the approval of this Agreement pursuant to the DGCL,
the Stockholder Consent and the Letters of Transmittal, each Seller hereby,
jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Equityholder Representative Group from and against any losses, liabilities,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, costs of other
skilled professionals and costs in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers), judgments, fines, settlements and amounts incurred by such Persons
arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in the Equityholder
Representative's capacity as the Equityholder Representative (except for those
arising out of the Equityholder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims (collectively, the "Representative Expenses").

not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided in Section 2.6(a). Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive payment of the fair value of such shares as shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively waives,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6(a), payable without
interest.

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tBuyer has delivered to the Company a true, complete and
correct copy of (i) an executed debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc. and Barclays Bank PLC (the "Debt Commitment Letter") and
(ii) each related fee letter (with customary redactions only with respect to
fee amounts and the economic terms of the "market flex" provisions and nothing
which would affect the amount or availability of the Financing), in each case
of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), in effect as of the date hereof (such
Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters, as they may be amended,
modified or replaced in accordance with Section 4.9, collectively, the
"Financing Commitments"), which establish commitments to provide debt
financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein and subject only to the
terms and conditions set forth therein (such debt financing described in the
Financing Commitments of such aggregate amount described therein, the
"Financing"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tAs of the date hereof, none of the Financing
Commitments have been amended or modified and no amendment or modification to
the Financing Commitments is contemplated; provided that, for purposes of the
foregoing, the existence or exercise of the "flex" provisions contained in one
or more fee letters with respect to the Financing Commitments shall not
constitute an amendment or modification of the Financing Commitments. The
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, other than any
replacement of the Financing Commitments permitted pursuant to Section 4.9, no
such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated. There
are no side letters or other contracts or arrangements related to the funding
of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments delivered to the Company pursuant to this Section 3.2(e). The
Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees, amounts or
expenses in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof and the Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence
existing on the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing
Commitments to be ineffective or inaccurate. The Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and the obligations set forth therein (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to provide the Financing upon
satisfaction or waiver of the Limited Financing Conditions) are the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Buyer and, to the Buyer's
Knowledge, each of the other parties thereto. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount (or
any portion) of the Financing, including any condition relating to the
availability of the Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision, other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (such conditions, the
"Limited Financing Conditions"). No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Buyer or, to the Buyer's
Knowledge, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. The
Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely
basis or that the Financing will not be made available to the Buyer on or
prior to the Closing, and the Buyer is not aware of the existence of any
current or anticipated fact or

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t conditions to funding not be satisfied on a timely basis or the Closing not to
occur. The Buyer has not incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or
other liability of any kind, and is not contemplating or aware of any
obligation, commitment, restriction or other liability of any kind, in either
case which could reasonably be expected to impair or adversely affect the
resources, funds or capabilities addressed by this Section 3.2(e) (including
the Financing Commitments and the Financing).

any and all steps necessary, to eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that is asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto

Termination Date, including but not limited to (i) promptly negotiating,
committing to and effecting by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divesture or disposition of Buyer's assets, properties or
businesses or the Company's assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by
Buyer pursuant hereto, and the entrance into (or termination of) any such
other arrangements, licenses, or agreements, as are necessary in order to
avoid, or effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from

litigation in no way limits the obligation of each Buyer to use its best
efforts, and to take any and all steps necessary, to eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law to close
the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Termination Date.

employees, (iii) jeopardize an attorney-client or attorney work product
privilege, (iv) be prohibited by Applicable Law or an existing contract or
agreement, or (v) violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or

opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Sellers, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Buyer and its
Representatives shall not be permitted to collect any air, soil, surface water
or ground water samples, nor to perform any invasive or destructive sampling
on any properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. During any
visits to any offices or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

times during any visits to the offices or properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or inspections, interviews and examinations conducted at or
on the offices or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In no
event shall the Buyer or any of its Representatives contact any customers of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the consent of the Company,
except for contacts made in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. For the avoidance of doubt, any access, information or

during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, make available and
provide the Equityholder Representative and its Representatives (including,
without limitation, counsel and independent auditors) with access to the
facilities and properties of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and to
all information, files, documents and records (written and computer) relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses or operations
for any and all periods prior to and including the Closing Date that they may
require with respect to any reasonable business purpose (including, without
limitation, any Tax matter) or in connection with any claim, dispute, action,
cause of action, investigation or proceeding of any kind by or against any
Person, and shall (and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
and other Affiliates to) cooperate fully with the Equityholder Representative
and its Representatives (including accountants, counsel and independent
auditors) in connection with the foregoing, at the sole cost and expense of
the Equityholder Representative, including, without limitation, by making Tax,
accounting and financial personnel and other appropriate employees and
officers of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries available to the
Equityholder Representative and its Representatives (including counsel and
independent auditors), with regard to any reasonable business purpose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be required to (and shall
not be required to cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and other
Affiliates to) grant access or furnish information to the Equityholder
Representative and its Representatives to the extent that such access or
disclosure would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) unreasonably

(ii) violate or prejudice the rights of its customers or employees, (iii)
jeopardize an attorney-client or attorney work product privilege, (iv) be
prohibited by Applicable Law or an existing contract or agreement, or (v)

individual performance or evaluation records, discipline or termination,
medical or workers compensation, disability or religious accommodation,

is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to risk of liability; provided that the Equityholder
Representative shall not be prohibited from accessing such information
pursuant to a valid court order. During any visits to any offices or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries permitted by this Section
4.3(b), the Equityholder Representative shall comply, and shall cause its
Representatives to comply, with all safety, health and security rules
applicable to the premises being visited. The Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have the right to have a Representative present at all
times during any visits to the offices or properties of the Company or any of

relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses or
operations for any and all periods prior to and including the Closing Date in
accordance with the existing retention policies of the Buyer.

hereof, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives acting on their behalf to), directly
or indirectly, take any of the following actions with any party other than the
Buyer and its designees: (A) solicit, knowingly encourage, seek, entertain,
support, assist, initiate or participate in any inquiry, negotiations or
discussions, or enter into any agreement, with respect to any offer or
proposal to acquire all or any material part of the business, properties or

(whether or not outstanding), whether by merger, purchase of assets, purchase
of equity interests of the Company, tender offer, license or otherwise, or
effect any such transaction, (B) disclose any non-public information to any
Person concerning the business, technologies or properties of the Company, or
afford to any Person access to their respective properties, technologies,

the Company's Affiliates shall receive, prior to the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, any
offer, proposal, or request, directly or indirectly, of the type referenced in
clause (A), (C), or (D) above, or any request for disclosure or access as

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 4.5 were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that the Buyer shall be entitled to
seek an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of
posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Section 4.5 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which the Buyer may be entitled at law or
in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth above by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

Financial Statements in a form that will comply with Rule 3-05 and Article 11
of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC; it being agreed that the preparation
of the S-X Financial Statements shall be the responsibility of Buyer and that

to any party's obligations hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the financial and accounting information used in the
preparation of the S-X Financial Statements. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain representation letters and similar
documents from applicable personnel as may be required in connection with the
preparation and audit of the S-X Financial Statements, it being agreed that
obtaining such representation letters is not a condition precedent to any
party's obligations hereunder. Buyer shall reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company with
respect to the Company's undertaking pursuant to this Section 4.6.

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tUntil the Closing Date, each of the parties shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, keep confidential, disclose
only to its Affiliates or Representatives and use only in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents all
information and data obtained by them from the other party or its Affiliates
or Representatives relating to such other party or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than information or data that is or becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section
4.7), unless disclosure of such information or data is required by Applicable
Law or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange; provided,
that prior to any such disclosure of information or data, to the extent not
prohibited by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange compelling such disclosure, the disclosing party shall, (i) provide
the non-disclosing party an opportunity to review the information or data to
be disclosed and comment on the nature, scope and contents of such disclosure
and (ii) have such comments be considered in good faith. In the event that
the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, each party shall,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, promptly return to the other party or destroy all
documents (including all copies thereof) containing any such information or
data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the
earlier of (x) the Closing Date or (y) its termination in accordance with its
terms.

 \t\t\t\t 4.8 \t\t\tTax Matters. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tTax Returns. The Company shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due on or before the Closing
Date. Upon request by the Buyer, the Company shall afford to Buyer and its
Representatives (including accountants and counsel) reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all historical Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries filed prior to the Closing,
together with the opportunity to make copies of such Tax Returns. The Buyer
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be
timely filed, all other Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
are due subsequent to the Closing Date. Any Tax Returns with respect to any
taxable period that ends prior to or includes the Closing Date shall be
prepared in accordance with past practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law. The Buyer shall
make available to the Equityholder Representative a draft of any Tax Return it
is responsible for the preparation of for a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date for review and comment by the
Equityholder Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
thereof and the Buyer shall make any changes to such Tax Return reasonably
proposed by the Equityholder Representative to the extent such changes are
consistent with Applicable Law.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tContests. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Contest"
is any audit, court proceeding or other dispute with respect to any Tax matter
that affects the Company or its Subsidiaries. Unless the Buyer has previously
received written notice from the Equityholder Representative of the existence
of such Contest, the Buyer shall give written notice to the Equityholder
Representative of the existence of any Contest relating to a Tax matter which
could

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t Article VIII, within ten days from the receipt by the Buyer of any written
notice of such Contest, but no failure to give such notice shall relieve the
Sellers of any liability hereunder unless the Sellers are materially
prejudiced thereby. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Equityholder
Representative, on the other, agree, in each case at no cost to the other
party, to cooperate with the other and the other's Representatives in a prompt
and timely manner in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall
include, but not be limited to, making available to the other party, during
normal business hours, all books, records, returns, documents, files, other
information (including, without limitation, working papers and schedules),
officers or employees (without substantial interruption of employment) or
other relevant information necessary or useful in connection with any Contest
requiring any such books, records and files. If a Contest relates to a Tax
matter that could result in an indemnity claim by any Buyer Indemnified Person
pursuant to Article VIII and the then remaining amount in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is equal to at least half of the amount of Taxes that would reasonably be
expected to be payable as a result of such Contest (such Contest, a "Seller
Tax Contest"), the Equityholder Representative shall, at its election, have
the right to represent the Company's or applicable Subsidiary's interests in
any such Seller Tax Contest, to employ counsel of its choice at its expense
(on behalf of the Sellers) and to control the conduct of such Seller Tax
Contest, including settlement or other disposition thereof; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall have the right to consult with the Equityholder
Representative regarding any such Seller Tax Contest at the Buyer's own
expense; provided further, that any settlement or other disposition of any
such Seller Tax Contest may only be with the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer
shall have the right to control any Seller Tax Contest that the Equityholder
Representative does not elect to control, and any other Contest that could
result in an indemnity claim by any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to
Article VIII; provided, however, that the Equityholder Representative shall
have the right to consult with the Buyer regarding any such Contest at the
Equityholder Representative's own expense (on behalf of the Sellers);
provided further, that any settlement or other disposition of any such Contest
may only be with the prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Except as
otherwise explicitly set forth in this Section 4.8(b), the Buyer shall have
the sole right to control the conduct of any Contest with respect to any
period ending after the Closing Date.

relating to all credits or refunds of Tax liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries no matter how secured (including credits for overpayment of
estimated Taxes) arising from or relating to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall remain with and be for
the benefit of the Buyer.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer and the Equityholder Representative agree that the Company and
its Subsidiaries may carry back any post-closing net operating loss, post-
closing loss from operations or any other post-closing Tax attribute of the
Companies to any taxable year that ends on or prior to the Closing Date and
Buyer shall be entitled to receive any refund of Taxes resulting from the
carry back of such post-closing Tax attributes; provided, however, that Buyer
must first agree that it will

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tOther Tax Matters. None of the Buyer, the Company or
any Subsidiary (nor any Affiliate thereof) shall (i) file or amend, or cause
to be filed or amended, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Returns or
Tax elections of the Company or any Subsidiary that relates to any period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case, without
the prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as required by
Applicable Law; (ii) make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any
similar provision under federal, state or local law) with respect to the
disposition and acquisition of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or (iii)
take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of
business or other than any action expressly permitted hereunder.

In furtherance of and without limitation to the foregoing, the Buyer shall:

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tmaintain in full force and effect the Financing
Commitments until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(except to the extent the Buyer is expressly permitted to earlier terminate
such Financing Commitments pursuant to the other terms and provisions of this
Section 4.9); 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tnegotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or on other terms that would not reasonably be expected
to hinder or delay the Closing of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement or the date on which the Financing could be obtained or made (which
terms shall not (x) expand in any way Company's obligations under this
Agreement, (y) expand on or amend the conditions to the funding of the
Financing or (z) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing available under
the Financing Commitments, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (y)

that the implementation of any "flex" provisions contained in any fee letters
with respect to the Financing Commitments (including any original issue
discount) shall be deemed not to violate the foregoing clause (z)); and

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tsatisfy, perform and observe on a timely basis (or
obtain a waiver of) all conditions and covenants applicable to Buyer and its
affiliates in the Financing Commitments and in any definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall comply with its obligations under the Financing
Commitments and any definitive agreements with respect to the Financing and
the consummation thereof at or prior to the Closing. Neither the Buyer nor
any of its affiliates shall take any action that would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tBuyer shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, (i) terminate the Financing Commitments or any definitive
agreement relating to the Financing (other than to the extent that any such
terminated Financing Commitments are substantially concurrently replaced in
accordance with the other terms and provisions of this Section 4.9), (ii)
agree to, permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or modification to,
or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Commitments or any
definitive agreement relating to the Financing if such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver would (A) reduce (or would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (unless,
concurrently with such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver, Buyer
obtains replacement financing for the full amount of any such reduction (or
expected reduction) in accordance the other terms and provisions of this
Section 4.9), (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise adversely change, expand or amend
or modify any of the conditions to the Financing or (C) reasonably be expected
to delay, impair or prevent the funding of the Financing or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood and
agreed that the Buyer may amend the Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing for the sole purpose of adding or
replacing lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Financing Commitments) or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing as of the date of this Agreement, but
only if such action would not result in the occurrence of any of the events or
circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C) or (iii)
agree to, permit or consent to any waiver of any remedy available to the Buyer
under the Financing Commitments or under any definitive agreement with respect
to the Financing. Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of any such termination, amendment, modification, supplement
or waiver.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and shall, upon reasonable
request, provide to the Company copies of the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing; provided that, in the case of customary fee letters, any fee
amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms of the market flex provisions
set forth therein may be redacted. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Buyer shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any
termination or expiration of the Financing

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t of the Financing, (ii) of any actual or alleged breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a breach or default) by any party
to the Financing Commitments or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which the Buyer becomes aware, (iii) of the receipt by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates of any written notice or other written communication
from any Financing Source, any lender or any other Person with respect to any
(A) actual, threatened or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Financing Commitments or any definitive agreement relating
to the Financing or any provision of the Financing contemplated pursuant to
the Financing Commitments or any such definitive agreements (including any
proposal by any Financing Source, any lender or any other Person to withdraw,
terminate or make a material change in the terms of (including the amount of
Financing contemplated by) the Financing Commitments) or (B) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitments or
any definitive agreement with respect to the Financing and (iv) if for any
reason the Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Company delivers to Buyer a written request, the Buyer shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in this Section 4.9(c). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Buyer may at any time (in its sole discretion) terminate the Financing
Commitments if (i) concurrently with such termination, (A) the Buyer shall
have arranged and obtained alternative financing in replacement thereof from
the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses
related thereto, with terms (including market flex provisions) not less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the Buyer than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Financing Commitments and in any event subject only to the
Limited Financing Conditions, and (B) the Buyer or its Affiliate shall have
agreed to pay all fees and expenses related to such alternative financing, and
(ii) such alternative financing would not reasonably be expected to (A)
prevent or delay the Closing of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement or the date on which the Financing could be obtained or made or (B)
otherwise expand the Company's obligations under this Agreement or limit
remedies available to the Buyer, as compared to such obligations and remedies
as of the date hereof. The Buyer shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of any and all executed Contracts pursuant to which any such
source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Financing; provided
that, in the case of customary fee letters, any fee amounts, pricing caps and
other economic terms of the market flex provisions set forth therein may be

contemplated hereby that would, absent an applicable waiver, be subject to the
imposition of excise taxes and/or deduction limitations under or by operation
of Code Section 280G, in each case, such that unless the waived payments (if

Surviving Corporation may cause coverage to be extended under the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies by obtaining at or prior
to the Closing a prepaid, non-cancelable six-year "tail" policy containing
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) if any DandO Proceeding claim occurs within such six-year period,
any insurance required to be maintained under this Section 4.16 shall be
continued in respect of such DandO Proceeding until the final disposition
thereof.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe rights to indemnification and to receive advancement
of expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Section 4.16 (a "DandO Indemnified Person") may at any time be entitled. No
right or remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive
of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at Applicable Law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent
the concurrent or subsequent assertion of any other right or remedy. The
Buyer hereby acknowledges that the DandO Indemnified Persons have or may, in the
future, have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
insurance provided by other Persons (collectively, "Other DandO Indemnitors").

Indemnified Person shall be secondary) and (ii) at all times, be required to
advance, and shall be liable, jointly and severally, for, the full amount of
all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to
the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement or
any DandO Indemnification Obligation, without regard to any rights that an DandO
Indemnified Person may have against the Other DandO Indemnitors. Furthermore,
the Buyer irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other DandO
Indemnitors from any and all claims (x) against the Other DandO Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind
in respect thereof and (y) that the DandO Indemnified Person must seek expense
advancement, reimbursement or indemnification from any Other DandO Indemnitor
before the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or the Buyer must perform
its expense advancement, reimbursement and indemnification obligations under
this Agreement. The Buyer hereby further agrees that no advancement,
indemnification or other payment by the Other DandO Indemnitors on behalf of an
DandO Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which an DandO Indemnified
Person has sought indemnification from the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing, and the Other DandO Indemnitors shall

of such DandO Indemnified Person against the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless against such
amounts actually paid by the Other DandO Indemnitors to or on behalf of such DandO
Indemnified Person to the extent such amounts would have otherwise been
payable by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries under any DandO
Indemnification Obligation.

indemnified for Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) (solely in
respect of breaches of subsections (a), (b), (d) and (m) of Section 4.1) for
any individual claim or a series of claims arising out of the same facts,
events or circumstances where the Losses relating thereto are less than
$75,000 (the "Pre-Basket Amount"). The limitations set forth in this Section
8.4(a) shall not apply to indemnification for Losses arising out of or
relating to the inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Representation, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1(n) relating to taxes
or to any representation in the event of fraud or criminal actions.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tLimitation as to Time. No Indemnifying Person shall be
liable for any Losses that are indemnifiable under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
unless a written claim for indemnification under this Agreement is delivered
by the Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Person with respect thereto
prior to the applicable Expiration Date; provided that if written notice is
given under Section 8.5 or Section 8.6 to the other party prior to the
applicable Expiration Date, if any, for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved,
without the requirement of commencing any action in order to extend such
Expiration Date or preserve such claim.

(B) as provided in the Stockholder Consent, (C) for the equitable remedies
described in Section 9.19, (D) for claims arising out of fraud or criminal
actions and (E) for claims for injunctive relief, each of the Buyer and the
Sellers acknowledge and agree that, the indemnification under the provisions
of this Article VIII will provide the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy
of the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons with
respect to claims for Losses or otherwise, including those set forth in
Sections 8.2 and 8.3, in connection with, arising out of or resulting from the
subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified Party shall

Losses were expressly included in the calculation of the Total Merger
Consideration.

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tThe maximum aggregate amount and the sole and exclusive
source of recovery in respect of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered by
the Buyer Indemnified Persons from the Sellers arising out of or relating to
the causes set forth in Section 8.2(a) shall be the amount of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount;

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tThe maximum aggregate amount and the sole and exclusive
source of recovery in respect of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered by
the Buyer Indemnified Persons from the Sellers arising out of or relating to
the causes set forth in Section 8.2(b) and (c) shall be the amount of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount plus, following the exhaustion or distribution in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement of all amounts available under the
Adjustment Escrow Fund, the amount remaining, at any given time, in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund; and

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tThe maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
that may be recovered by the Seller Indemnified Persons from the Buyer,
arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in Section 8.3, shall be
an amount equal to $14,000,000; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprovided that the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not
apply to Losses arising out of or relating to fraud or criminal actions;
provided further, that, the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to
Losses arising under the representations and warranties of the Sellers
contained in the Stockholder Consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to (x) Losses arising
out of or relating to fraud or criminal actions of such Seller or (y)
obligations of such Seller contained in the applicable Stockholder Consent, in
no event shall any Seller be directly liable to the Buyer Indemnified Persons
under this Agreement under any circumstances, and upon the final release of
all funds from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the
Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no further recourse (directly or
indirectly) against the Sellers, their respective Affiliates or any of their
assets, properties or businesses. In furtherance of the foregoing, and

  \t\t\t65  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t event shall any Seller be liable (other than with respect to fraud or criminal
conduct by such Seller) under any Transaction Document or under the
Stockholder Consent for an amount in excess of the amount actually received by
such Seller in connection with the Transactions contemplated under this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tLimitations on Tax Losses. No Buyer Indemnified Person
shall be indemnified for Losses relating to (i) any Taxes attributable to a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date other than
Taxes arising from a breach of the representation contained in Section
3.1(n)(iii), (ii) the amount or availability of any net operating loss,
capital loss, Tax credit carryover or other Tax asset, (iii) any action taken
by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) after the Closing or (iv) any Taxes attributable to a breach of
any covenant hereunder by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tCharacterization of Payments. For all Tax purposes, the
parties agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to
treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration payable to the Sellers pursuant to Article II unless a
final and nonappealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority
(which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form)
provides otherwise; provided that the Indemnifying Person's prior written
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will
be obtained by the Indemnified Person who seeks to accept, via a settlement or
compromise with any such Governmental Authority, a position that is contrary
to treatment of an indemnity payment as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration payable to the Sellers pursuant to Article II.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, ANY
LIMITATIONS, QUALIFICATIONS OR OTHER PROCEDURES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL NOT BE
DEEMED TO APPLY TO ANY CLAIM FOR LOSSES UNDER ANY RandW POLICY PURCHASED BY THE
BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 \t\t\t\t 8.5 \t\t\tThird Party Claims. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tPromptly after receipt by any Indemnified Person of any
claim or demand by a third party (an "Asserted Liability") that may result in
a Loss that is subject to indemnification under the terms hereof, such
Indemnified Person shall give written notice thereof (the "Claims Notice") to
the Indemnifying Persons. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted
Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if
necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered. The failure to
provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Person from
any of its obligations under this Article VIII unless, and only to the extent
that, the Indemnifying Person is materially prejudiced by such failure. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tIf the Indemnifying Persons acknowledge in writing their
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Persons against any and all Losses
that may result from an Asserted Liability, the Indemnifying Persons shall be,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.5, 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t66  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t provided, however, that the Indemnifying Persons shall not have the right to
assume control of the defense of any Asserted Liability (i) to the extent that
the object of such Asserted Liability is to obtain an injunction, restraining
order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified
Person which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business,
operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Person, or (ii)
if the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the Indemnified Persons and the Indemnifying Persons and
the former shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the
Indemnifying Persons) that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to them that are different from or additional to those available to
Indemnifying Persons; provided further, that to exercise such rights the
Indemnifying Person must give notice to the Indemnified Person within 30 days
after receipt of any such Claims Notice whether it is agreeing to accept
responsibility and assuming control of and appointing lead counsel for such
defense. If the Indemnifying Person does not give such notice within such
30-day period or either proviso in this Section 8.5(b) applies, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to assume control of the defense
thereof at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tIf the Indemnifying Person shall assume the control of
the defense of the Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 8.5, (i) the Indemnifying Person shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person before entering into any settlement,
compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted
Liability if the settlement does not unconditionally release the Indemnified
Person from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Asserted
Liability or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Person and (ii) the Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense of such
Asserted Liability and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose. The fees, costs and expenses of any such separate counsel to the
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be paid by the
Indemnified Person. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tIf the Indemnified Person shall assume the control of
the defense of any Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 8.5, the Indemnified Person shall have the sole right to assume
the defense of and settle such Asserted Liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate, at its
cost and expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, and the Indemnifying Person
shall be entitled to contest the reasonableness of any such settlement to
which it does not consent. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tEach party shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted
Liability and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information
and testimony (subject to any applicable confidentiality agreement), and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as
may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  \t\t\t67  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t OF ANY CLAIM UNDER THE RandW POLICY; PROVIDED, THAT NOTHING IN THIS CLAUSE (f)
SHALL REQUIRE THE EQUITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE OR THE COMPANY TO TAKE ANY
ACTION THAT (I) WOULD PREJUDICE THEIR RIGHTS TO ASSERT A CLAIM OR DEFEND
THEMSELVES AGAINST ANY CLAIM, OR (II) CONSTITUTE THE ADMISSION OF ANY BREACH
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY FAULT OR LIABILITY WHATSOEVER (WHETHER TO BUYER OR
ANY OTHER PERSON). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.6 \t\t\tDirect Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified
Person seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 8.5
because no Asserted Liability is involved, the Indemnified Person shall notify
the Indemnifying Person in writing of any Losses that such Indemnified Person
claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. The failure of
the Indemnified Person to exercise promptness in such notification shall not
amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the
resulting delay materially and adversely prejudices the position of the
Indemnifying Person with respect to such claim. After the delivery of a claim
notice pursuant to this Section 8.6, the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnified Person shall be entitled under this Article VIII shall be
determined (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Person, (ii) by a final and non-appealable judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall agree in writing.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.7 \t\t\tOther Claims. In connection with any Losses for which
an Indemnified Person may seek indemnification under this Article VIII, such
Indemnified Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek and
pursue any available insurance coverage maintained by the acquired business
(it being understood that the foregoing shall not apply to the RandW Policy) or
other claims against third parties that such Indemnified Person may have in
respect of such Losses and the amount of insurance proceeds (other than under
any RandW Policy) or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified
Person (less any deductibles and the related reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in recovering such amounts) shall
not be included in Losses that such Indemnified Person may recover under this
Article VIII and if the Indemnified Person receives any such amounts
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Person in respect
of such Losses, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Person for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Person in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the above amounts so received by the Indemnified Person.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.8 \t\t\tIndemnification Payment. Any indemnification required
hereunder shall be made by prompt payment (i) by the Escrow Agent in respect
of the indemnification obligations of the Sellers (subject to Sections
8.4(d)(i) and (ii)) and (ii) by the Buyer in respect of the indemnification
obligations of the Buyer (subject Section to 8.4(d)(iii)).

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.9 \t\t\tRemedies Not Affected by Investigation or Knowledge. If
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Buyer expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any Losses arising
out of or relating to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein, notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to,

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t respect of any fact or circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such
breach, whether before or after the execution and delivery hereof. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and the Equityholder Representative
agree that knowledge or lack of reliance shall not be a defense in law or
equity to any claim of breach of representation, warranty or covenant by the
Sellers herein, the Sellers, the Company or the Equityholder Representative
shall not in any proceeding concerning a breach or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant herein, or any indemnity thereof, seek
information concerning knowledge or reliance of the Buyer or any of its
Representatives, through deposition, discovery or otherwise or seek to
introduce evidence or argument in any proceeding regarding the knowledge or
lack of reliance of the Buyer or any of its Representatives, through
deposition, discovery or otherwise or seek to introduce evidence or argument
in any proceeding regarding the knowledge or lack of reliance of the Buyer or
any of its Representatives prior to the Closing on or with respect to any such
representations, warranties or covenants.

 \t\t\t\t 8.10 \t\t\tNo Duplication of Remedies. In no event shall any
Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate compensation with respect to any
claims for any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other
obligation under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no Losses may be
claimed under this Article VIII by any Indemnified Person to the extent such
Losses are included in the calculation of any adjustment to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article II.

 \t\t\t\t 8.11 \t\t\tEscrow. On or prior to the Closing, the Equityholder
Representative, the Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement. Promptly following the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Survival Date"), the Buyer and the Equityholder
Representative shall deliver a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent to
deliver (a)(i) the portion of each former Stockholder's Fully Diluted
Percentage of the sum of the remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund
minus any amounts that would be necessary to satisfy any then pending and
unsatisfied or unresolved claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 if
such claim(s) were resolved in full in favor of the Buyer Indemnified Persons
(which amounts will continue to be held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund until the
related claims have been finally resolved) (such sum, the "Distributable
Amount"), attributable to Shares (as opposed to In-the-Money Options or RSUs)
previously held by such former Stockholder, subject to Section 2.8, to such
former Stockholder as soon as practicable and (ii) the portion of each former
holder's Fully Diluted Percentage of the Distributable Amount attributable to
In-the-Money Options or RSUs (as opposed to Shares) previously held by such
former holder to the Surviving Corporation for delivery to such former holder
of In-the-Money Options and RSUs through the Surviving Corporation's payroll
system; provided that if no such notice is delivered to the Escrow Agent
within five (5) Business Days after the Survival Date, the Escrow Agent shall
automatically and without further action by either the Buyer or the
Equityholder Representative release the Distributable Amount in accordance
with the preceding sentence. Promptly following the time that any such
pending and unsatisfied or unresolved claims have been finally resolved, the
Buyer and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver a joint written notice
to the Escrow Agent to deliver (x) the portion of each former Stockholder's
Fully Diluted Percentage of the revised Distributable Amount attributable to
Shares (as opposed to In-the-Money Options or RSUs) previously held by such
former Stockholder, subject to Section 2.8, to such former Stockholder as soon
as practicable and (y) the portion of each former holder's Fully Diluted
Percentage of the revised Distributable Amount attributable to In-the-Money
Options or RSUs (as opposed to Shares) previously held by

Sellers irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries from any and all claims against the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries for contribution, subrogation, indemnification or any other
recovery of any kind in respect of any claim for indemnification made against

amended only by an instrument in writing signed by the Buyer and the Company
(in the event such amendment occurs prior to the Closing Date) or the
Equityholder Representative (in the event such amendment occurs after the
Closing Date); provided, however, that after obtaining the approval of the

the Stockholders or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub without the further
approval of such stockholders; provided further, that this Section 9.2,

Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated herein is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

or Affiliate may be directly adverse to the Buyer and even though Company
Counsel may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to
such dispute prior to Closing.
