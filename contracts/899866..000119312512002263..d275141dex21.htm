---|--- 

\- 4 - (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after obtaining the
Written Consent (and, if the Written Consent is obtained, in any event within
ten (10) days following the date of this Agreement), the Company shall mail to
each holder of record of Company Stock (i) a Letter of Transmittal and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificate in exchange for
the applicable Closing Stock Consideration and the portion of the Future
Payments allocated to such Company Stock pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement payable with respect thereto. At and after the Effective Time, upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent and delivery
of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to pay promptly (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days) to the holder of such Certificate in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to (i) the Closing Per Share
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock
represented by such Certificate. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Company in developing arrangements to facilitate
the payment of the Closing Per Share Consideration to
significant stockholders of the Company immediately following the Effective
Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Closing
Stock Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Closing Stock Consideration as contemplated by this Section
2.2(b). By their execution of the Letter of Transmittal, approval of the
Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or their acceptance of any
consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each Company Equityholder hereby
agrees on behalf of itself to the provisions set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal.

(c) _Allocation Schedules; Payments of Future Payments_.

(i) The Initial Allocation Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ sets forth
a summary of the allocation (estimated as of the date hereof) of the amounts
payable at the Closing to the Company Equityholders. The Company shall deliver
to Buyer and the Paying Agent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Closing Date Allocation Schedule (attached as an exhibit to the
Closing Payment Certificate). The Paying Agent shall make all payments
constituting the Closing Stock Consideration to the applicable Company
Equityholders in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule and the
Letters of Transmittal. The Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on
the information set forth on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule and shall
have no liability to any Company Equityholder or otherwise based on any errors
or omissions in the Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

\- 5 - (ii) The portion of each Future Payment payable to the holders of
Company Stock shall be paid (reduced by any applicable withholding) by the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Company Stock, and the portion of each Future Payment payable to
the holders of Company Options shall be paid (reduced by any applicable
withholding) by the Surviving Corporation to the holders of Company Options,
in each case in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule within
the time periods set forth herein for such payments.

(iii) The parties understand and agree that (A) the Future Payments are an
integral part of the consideration payable to the Company Equityholders in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as otherwise
provided herein (including Sections 2.1(d)(iii), 2.4 and 9.6), shall be
payable without offset or counterclaim, (B) the Company Equityholders have no
rights as a security holder of the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer as a
result of their right to receive the Future Payments, and (C) no interest is
payable as additional consideration with respect to any of the Future
Payments. For the avoidance of doubt, more than one Future Payment may become
payable at any time.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All consideration paid
following the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of
Company Stock (including any Future Payments payable with respect thereto) in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock, and
from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar law), upon demand, and any holder of Company
Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled
to receive from the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
law) the portion of the Total Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Company Equityholder for any amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Buyer, the Escrow
Agent and the Surviving Corporation (and its payroll agent) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, including with respect to Shares acquired upon the exercise of
any Company Options, to the Company Equityholders such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, the
Buyer, the Escrow Agent or the

---|--- 

\- 8 -  the Stockholder Representatives Fund is no longer necessary in connection

shall not be available to the Buyer to satisfy any claims hereunder.

shall be indemnified by the Company Equityholders from and against any loss,
liability or expense incurred in good faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representatives and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of their duties hereunder. Any such claim for indemnification
shall be satisfied first from the Stockholder Representatives Fund and, if
such fund is insufficient to satisfy any such loss, liability or expense, from
the first proceeds from Future Payments otherwise available for distribution
to the Company Equityholders or by a claim against the Company Equityholders
(with each Company Equityholder liable for his Pro Rata Share of any such
claim).

 

(e) Subject to prior execution of the Stockholder Rep Confidentiality
Agreement, the Stockholder Representatives shall have reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for periods
prior to the Closing (the " _Company Pre-Closing Information_ "), and

and exercising their rights hereunder.

(f) In the event any Stockholder Representative becomes unable to perform his
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Company
Equityholders (acting by a written instrument signed by holders of Company
Stock who held, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a majority (by
voting power) of the then outstanding shares of Company Stock)

---|--- 

\- 9 -  shall select another representative to fill the vacancy of such Stockholder
Representative, and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be a
Stockholder Representative for all purposes of this Agreement. A Stockholder
Representative may only be removed upon delivery of written notice to the
Buyer signed by Persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
held a majority (by voting power) of the then outstanding shares of Company
Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stockholder Representative may not be
any Person who is (i) an employee of a company (other than the Buyer) listed
on a national securities exchange in the United States or elsewhere that
is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, distributing or
selling pharmaceutical products or (ii) is an individual whose primary
occupation is in the employment of a competitive company that is engaged in

(i) the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Stockholder Representatives as to the settlement of any
disputes or claims under this Agreement, or any other actions required or
permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representatives hereunder, and no
party hereunder or any Company Equityholder shall have any cause of action
against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of the Stockholder Representatives;

(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Equityholder may have
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of each applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to

the extent it has theretofore been exercised) shall be converted, in
settlement and cancellation thereof, into (i) the right to receive the Closing
Per Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option and (ii) the portion of the Future Payments allocated to
such Company Option pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case
subject to withholding as provided in Section 2.2. Upon such conversion
any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the
holder thereof for shares of Company Common Stock (or any other Equity
Interest), but shall only entitle such holder to the Closing Per Option
Consideration and the portion of the Future Payments allocated to such
Company Option pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, as described in the
preceding sentence.

cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of Company Options cash
in an amount equal to the Closing Per Option Consideration for each Company
Option held by such holder of Company Options, in accordance with the Closing
Date Allocation Schedule, reduced by any applicable withholding; provided,
that the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such payment
to take place within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of Company
Options any amounts payable with respect to each Future Payment (reduced by
applicable withholding) (i) concurrently with the payment of such Future
Payments to the holders of Company Stock and (ii) in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each holder of a Company Option or a Company Warrant a
letter describing the treatment of such Company Option or Company Warrant, as
the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.6. The Buyer shall have
reasonable advance opportunity to review and provide comments on such letters
before they are mailed.

(d) At the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Warrant that
is then outstanding to be cancelled and shall cause such warrant to cease to
exist and no payment or consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall mail to each holder of a Company Warrant a letter describing
the treatment of such Company Warrant pursuant to this Section 2.5. 

2.6. _Milestone Payments_.

(a) _Milestone Events and Milestone Payments_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall make the payments (each a "
_Milestone Payment_ ") set forth in Sections 2.6(a)(i) through 2.6(a)(viii)
below to the Company Equityholders upon the first achievement by a member of
the Buyer Rights Chain Group of the relevant "Milestone" listed under Sections

Agreement is Four Hundred Seventy Million Dollars ($470,000,000). For purposes
of clarity, more than one of the Milestone Payments set forth in Section
2.6(a)(v)-(viii) may be earned based on the Net Sales of Products during the
same consecutive four (4) calendar quarter period. By way of example, if in a
four consecutive calendar quarter period, the Net Sales for all Products in
such four calendar quarters are for the first time greater than [*] and also
greater than or equal to [*] but less than [*], then the Milestone Payments
set forth in both Sections 2.6(a)(v) and (vi) would be due. The portion of
each of the Milestone Payments in Section 2.6(a)(i) through (viii) that may
become payable to holders of Company Options shall be deemed a separate
payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

each country in which the ENB-0040 Product receives Regulatory Approval for
the treatment of HPP.

(ii) Other than the diligence obligations specifically set forth in
this Section 2.6(c), neither the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation nor any
other member of the Buyers Rights Chain Group shall have other diligence
obligations with respect to achievement of the Milestones, including with
respect to seeking to develop, market or sell the ENB-0040 Product or any
Other Product.

(d) _Reporting_.

 

(i) Commencing July 1, 2012, during the Developmental Milestone Period, the

\- 12 - (ii) The Buyer shall provide written notice to the
Stockholder Representatives of the achievement of each of the Developmental
Milestones no later than [*] after the occurrence thereof (or after Buyer

for each Combination Product in such country and the amounts assigned to
components "A", "B" or "C", as applicable, of the fractions applied to the
Combination Sale Amount for such Combination Product in such country;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the identity of any such country does not need
to be provided.

(e) _Audits_. From and after the achievement of the Milestone set forth in
Section 2.6(a)(iv), upon the written request of the Stockholder
Representatives, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) and other members of the Buyer Rights Chain Group
to, permit an independent public accountant (the " _Accountant_ ") selected by
the Stockholder Representatives and reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, at
the Company EquityholdersÂ’ expense, to have reasonable access upon reasonable
prior notice and during normal business hours, but no more than once during
any calendar year, to review the records specified in Section 2.6(d)(iii) for
the purpose of determining the accuracy of the reports described in Section
2.6(d)(iv) (an " _Audit_ "). In the event that the Accountant concludes that
any Milestone Payment in respect of the Commercial Milestones was not paid

written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") of such non-payment, in which case the
Stockholder Representatives and the Buyer shall, for a period of not less

faith to resolve the items in dispute. In the event no agreement can be
reached by the Stockholder Representatives and the Buyer as to
the calculation of the Aggregate Net Product Sales within thirty (30) days
after delivery of a Dispute Notice, then either party shall have the right to

resolution mechanism determines that, any Milestone Payment was not paid as a
result of an underreporting of Net Sales by more than five percent (5%), the

reasonable out-of-pocket costs of the Audit. A quarterly period can only be
subject to an Audit on one occasion and the Stockholder Representatives shall
not be permitted to Audit a calendar quarter more than three years after the

with respect to a quarter(s) may be combined with the results of an Audit with
respect to a subsequent quarter(s) to determine Aggregate Net Sales and
whether the Milestone Payment in respect of a Commercial Milestone was
properly paid.

to which the lenders party thereto have agreed to provide or cause to be
provided the commitments set forth therein, subject solely to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, for the purposes of funding payment of a
portion of the Total Consideration (the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date
hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment, in the form so delivered, is a legal,

other parties thereto. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and compliance by the Company with its
covenants and agreement hereunder, as of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of Buyer, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would result in the Debt Financing not being available at

by it contained in the Debt Financing Commitments. The Buyer has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement and will pay
any such fees required by the Debt Financing Commitments to be paid prior to

funded in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitments, together with the
cash of the Buyer, will provide the Buyer with acquisition financing at the
Effective Time sufficient to consummate the Merger and pay the portion of the
Total Consideration payable at the Closing upon the terms contemplated by

set forth in Article III, immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall

property having a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to
pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of
all contingent liabilities) and (b) have adequate capital to carry on their
respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.7. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. The Buyer and the Transitory

Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any

case may be, not to be satisfied or (b) any failure of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, which failure would reasonably be expected to
cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b), as the
case may be, not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the

occurrence of any event arising after the date of this Agreement (without
breach of Section 5.1 or Section 6.1), (ii) such notice is accompanied by a
Company Termination Right Notice and (iii) the Buyer does not exercise its
termination right prior to the Closing, then the information set forth in such
notice shall constitute an amendment of the representation or warranty to
which it relates for purpose of Article IX of this Agreement such that the
Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification under Article IX of this
Agreement with respect to such matter to the extent of the information so
disclosed. Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a Company Termination
Right Notice, the Buyer shall provide written notice to the Company, which
notice shall be binding on the Buyer, pursuant to which the Buyer shall agree
or dispute that the Buyer is entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.1(d) as a result of such
Company Termination Right Notice.

after the Closing Date or for such greater period as shall be required by
applicable law, maintain (or cause its Subsidiaries to maintain) employee

of the benefits provided by (i) the CompanyÂ’s or any SubsidiaryÂ’s plan,
program or practice in effect on the date hereof and set forth on the Company
Disclosure Schedules with respect to such Continuing Employee or (ii) any
severance pay plan, program or practice maintained by the Buyer or its
Subsidiaries for similarly situated employees. For the avoidance of doubt,

require the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to
maintain employment of any Continuing Employee.

 

(b) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee
service credit for eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual or
calculation) for purposes of (i) eligibility to participate in any Buyer
Employee Plans and (ii) determination of benefit levels under any Buyer
Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance, in each case with
respect to plans for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and
in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, to the extent that
such credit was given under the Company Employee Plans, but not where such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent
such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company and
recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its
medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) prohibit the Company, the Buyer or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from amending, modifying or terminating,
or shall be construed as an amendment or modification to, any or all
compensation or benefit plans, programs, policies, practices, agreements and
arrangements sponsored or maintained by the Company, the Buyer or any of
their Subsidiaries, including each Company Employee Plan and Buyer Employee
Plan, or construed as the establishment of any compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement, (ii) require the Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries to continue any particular compensation or benefit
plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement after the Effective
Time, or (iii) confer upon any Person not a party hereto any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

a stockholder vote the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Section 280G(c) of the Code) listed in Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that, if such vote is adopted by the Company stockholders in a manner that
satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B)

Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration set forth in the Closing Payment
Certificate was greater than the Target Amount, the excess, if any, of the

9.2. _Indemnification by the Buyer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article IX, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company Equityholders from and against any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by any Company Equityholder to the extent resulting from

Subsidiary contained in this Agreement; or 

(b) any failure by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to perform any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

9.3. _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the following
procedures. An Indemnified Party shall deliver a Third Party Claim Notice
within 30 days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of any Third
Party Action or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such claim by a third
party, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known by
the Buyer) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and
the amount of the claimed damages; _provided_ , that failure to timely
deliver such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligations under this Article IX except to the extent it is actually
prejudiced by such failure. Within 30 days after delivery of such Third Party
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action,
at its expense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
so long as (i) the _ad damnum_ set forth in such Third Party Action and other
Damages reasonably expected to result from the Third Party Action do not
exceed 150% of the amount then remaining in the Escrow Account; (ii) the
Third Party Action involves only money damages and does not seek any
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or its
Subsidiaries, (iii) the Indemnified Party has not been advised in writing by
outside counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Action, (iv) the Indemnifying Party provides reasonable
evidence to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party has reasonably
adequate financial resources to pay the cost of the defense of such Third
Party Action, (v) the Third Party Action

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

---|--- 

\- 52 -  does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or
regulatory enforcement action and (vi) neither the Third Party Action nor the
defense thereof challenges the ownership, scope or validity of a Patent or
other Intellectual Property material to the business at the time of such Third
Party Action. The Indemnifying Party shall conduct the defense of any such
Third Party Action diligently and in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control
such defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein
at its own expense; _provided_ that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control
of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on
advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
have conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Action, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in
connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnifying
Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one (1) counsel
for all Indemnified Parties. The party controlling such defense shall keep the
other party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense
thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other party with
respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of
such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Third Party
Action that does not include a complete release of the Indemnified Party from
all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or
obligation on the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party.

 

(b) _Procedure for Claims Not Involving Third Parties_. An Indemnified Party
wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this Article IX that does
not involve a Third Party Action shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
Claim Notice. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
in which the Indemnifying Party shall (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claim Amount (in which case (A) if the
Indemnifying Party is the Buyer, such response shall be accompanied by
a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claim
Amount, by check or by wire transfer, and (B) if the Indemnifying Party is the
Company Equityholders, the Stockholder Representatives shall take such actions
as are required pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to cause the Claim Amount to
be released to the Buyer from the Escrow Account), (ii) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claim
Amount (in which case (A) if the Indemnifying Party is the Buyer, such
response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of such agreed amount, by check or by wire transfer, and (B)
if the Indemnifying Party is the Company Equityholders, the Stockholder
Representatives shall take such actions as are required pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to cause such agreed amount to be released to the Buyer from the
Escrow Account) or (C) contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive any of the Claim Amount. If the Indemnifying Party in such response
contests the payment of all or part of the Claim Amount, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve
such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 60 days following the
delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such response, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to
a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.10.

the Buyer under this Article IX shall not exceed the balance of the Escrow
Account and shall be payable solely out of the Escrow Account pursuant to the

set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.5(a) shall not apply in
the case of the Excluded Matters.

for any Damages and the BuyerÂ’s sole recourse for any Damages shall be to the
proceeds available in the Escrow Account.

 

(c) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
Article IX with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by (i) the
amount of any net Tax benefit actually received in cash or in actual reduction
of a current Tax liability by the Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof)
(after first taking into account all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit (or any other Tax attributes) of such Person) directly
attributable to the incurrence or payment of the underlying obligations
relating to such indemnity claim in the taxable year of such incurrence or
payment and the next taxable year immediately following such taxable year and

\- 54 -  Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) with respect to such indemnity
claim. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue, and to cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims to which
it is entitled, the proceeds of which would provide compensation with respect
to the Damages that are the subject of such indemnity claim. If an Indemnified
Party (or an Affiliate thereof) receives any insurance payment in connection
with any claim for Damages for which it has already been paid under this
Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall be reimbursed within 30 days after
received such insurance payment by an amount equal to the lesser of (A)
the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under this Article IX
with respect to such claim or (B) the amount of such insurance payment;
_provided_ that, if the indemnity claim was made by Buyer, (x) if the
reimbursement is to be paid prior to the termination of the Escrow Account,
it shall be paid to the Escrow Account to be held in the Escrow Account, (y)
if the reimbursement is to be paid after the termination of the Escrow Account
and at the time of such reimbursement the amount of outstanding open
indemnity claims exceed the amount the held in the Escrow Account, then the
amount of such excess (or, if such reimbursement is less than the amount of
such excess, the amount of such reimbursement) shall be paid to the Escrow
Agent to be held in the Escrow Account, and Buyer shall pay any remaining
amount of such reimbursement to the Company Equityholders and (z) if the
reimbursement is to be paid after the termination of the Escrow Account
and at the time of such reimbursement the there are no open indemnity claims,
then Buyer shall pay the amount of such reimbursement to the Company
Equityholders.

(d) Except with respect to claims for actual fraud against the individual
guilty of such fraud, claims against the StockholdersÂ’ Representative pursuant
to the Stockholder Rep Confidentiality Agreement and claims for equitable
relief made with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, from and after the Closing (i) subject to the last sentence of
Section 11.9, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Article IX
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective Affiliates with respect to claims under, or otherwise relating to
the transactions that are the subject of, this Agreement and (ii) subject to
Section 9.6, the proceeds available in the Escrow Account shall be the sole
and exclusive means for the Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX. Without limiting

\- 55 - 9.6. _Additions to Escrow Account_.

 

(a) In the event that prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 9.4, the Buyer has made a good faith claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX that is not yet satisfied out of
the Escrow Account (an " _Unresolved Claim_ ") and the Buyer thereafter
becomes obligated to make a Milestone Payment pursuant to Section 2.6 at a
time when such Unresolved Claim remains open, then:

(i) if such Unresolved Claim is an Excluded Matter, the Buyer may deposit in
the Escrow Account (or, if no funds remain in the Escrow Account, a successor
escrow account with the Escrow Agent governed by an escrow agreement in
substantially the same form as the Escrow Agreement) a portion of such
Milestone Payment equal to the lesser of (A) the portion of the BuyerÂ’s good
faith estimate of the Damages associated with all Unresolved Claims with
respect to such Excluded Matter recoverable under this Article IX in excess
of the difference of (I) the balance of the Escrow Account at such time minus
(II) BuyerÂ’s good faith estimate of the Damages associated with any other
Unresolved Claims that remain open (the " _Unresolved Claim Amount_ ") and
(B) [*] of such Milestone Payment;

(ii) if such Unresolved Claim is not an Excluded Matter, the Buyer may
deposit in the Escrow Account (or, if no funds remain in the Escrow Account, a
successor escrow account with the Escrow Agent governed by an escrow agreement
in substantially the same form as the Escrow Agreement) a portion of such
Milestone Payment equal to the lesser of (A) the portion of the BuyerÂ’s good
faith estimate of the Damages associated with such Unresolved Claim in excess
of the difference of (I) the balance of the Escrow Account at such
time, minus (II) the then outstanding Unresolved Claim Amount, but only to
the extent such excess amount does not exceed the sum of (x) the amount, if
any, of that portion of the original proceeds in the Escrow Account previously
released from the Escrow Account to an Indemnified Party with respect to a
prior claim for indemnification for an Excluded Matter and (y) the then
outstanding Unresolved Claim Amount in respect of any other Excluded Matters
and (B) [*] of such Milestone Payment; _provided_ , that if the Excluded
Matters referred to in clause (y) above are either finally resolved without
any payment from the Escrow Account or if the final Unresolved Claim Amount
for such Excluded Matters is less than the Unresolved Claim Amount calculated
for purposes of determining the portion of the Milestone Payment to be paid to
the Escrow Account, then, following the final resolution of all such Excluded
Matters, the Buyer and the Stockholder Representatives shall cause the Escrow
Agent to release for the benefit of the Company Equityholders an amount equal
to the difference between the final amount payable from the Escrow Account to
the Buyer on account of such Excluded Matters and the amount deposited into
the Escrow Account with respect to the non-Excluded Matter; and

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, if no portion of the original Escrow Amount
is released to satisfy an Excluded Matter, then no portion of any Milestone
Payment may be setoff in connection with an indemnification claim that is not
an Excluded Matter.

Payment was due, (i) deposit in the Escrow Account the amount by which such
Milestone Payment was reduced pursuant to Section 9.6(a) (each such payment,
an "Escrow Account Addition") for the purpose of securing the Unresolved Claim
giving rise to such Escrow Account Addition and (ii) deliver a written notice
to the Stockholder Representatives stating that Buyer has exercised its right
to deposit a portion of such Milestone Payment in the Escrow Account pursuant
to this Section 9.6, the amount so deposited, and a confirmation that such
amount has been paid into the Escrow Account. Any such Escrow Account
Addition shall be released in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement.

expenses and corresponding Tax costs) to the extent of the amount of the
indemnification payment; and

 

(B) second, for Taxes (I) incurred in the ordinary course of business after
the date of the Company Balance Sheet and included in the definition of Net
Current Liabilities plus (II) to the extent not covered in the preceding
clause (I), reserved for on the Company Balance Sheet; provided, however, that
clauses (I) and (II) shall not apply to indemnification obligations with
respect to: (x) Taxes incurred by either the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction (other than its jurisdiction of tax residency
or domicile) in connection with income arising from activities in such
jurisdiction including income attributable to a "permanent establishment" as

Treaty (except to the extent included in the definition of Net

withholding obligations, payment obligations and reporting requirements; and
(z) any and all withholding Taxes required to be withheld in respect of any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to the Company Equityholders
or in respect of the exercise or cancellation of Company Options.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall not be entitled to an
indemnification payment for Taxes pursuant to this Article IX to the extent
that any Tax attributes of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including net
operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, and Tax credits) as of
the Closing Date are available to reduce the amount of Taxes otherwise payable
under applicable jurisdictional law. Any claims for indemnification under
Section 9.1(a) for a breach of the representations and warranties set forth

9.7(a).

\- 58 - (c) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Tax period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any
Taxes of the Company based upon or measured by net income or gain for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the Tax period of any partnership formed in connection with any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement in which either the Company or its Subsidiaries
holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate at such time). The
amount of Taxes, other than Taxes of the Company based upon or measured by net
income or gain for a Straddle Period, which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.

charges incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will be shared equally by the Buyer and the Company Equityholders,
with the portion thereof payable by the Company Equityholders to be paid when
due solely from the Escrow Account.

(f) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Buyer, the Company and the Stockholder
Representatives will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by another party, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries for which one party could reasonably require
the assistance of the other party in obtaining any necessary information.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partyÂ’s
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax matter. The Company and the Stockholder Representatives agree
(A) to retain all books and records in their possession as of the Closing Date
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any of the Company relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the
Stockholder Representatives, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention requirements under applicable
law or record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
(B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if another party so
requests, the Company or the Stockholder Representatives, as the case may be,
shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

 

(g) _Treatment of Payments_. Each party agrees to treat, for Tax purposes, all
payments made by it to or for the benefit of another party (including any
payments to the Company or the Company Equityholders) under indemnity
provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the Total Consideration, except
to the extent that the legal requirements of a particular jurisdiction
require otherwise.

\- 80 - 11.3. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other Person or entity any rights or remedies
hereunder, except (a) with respect to Section 6.6 (with respect to which the
Company Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries), (b) prior to
the Effective Time, for the right of Company Equityholders to pursue claims

terminated pursuant to Article VIII, which right is hereby expressly

Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one or more of their Affiliates or make a collateral assignment of its rights
under this Agreement to any Financing Sources and it is acknowledged that the
Buyer will incorporate a Canadian company (" _Canco_ ") which will be the
shareholder of the Transitory Subsidiary; _provided_ that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve the Buyer, Canco or the Transitory Subsidiary of
its primary liability for its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to the Buyer, Canco or

competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the

invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is

enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

11.6. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become

delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by

outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the corporation entitled to vote irrespective of the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

6\. The business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors. The size of the Board of Directors
shall be determined as set forth in the by-laws of this corporation, as in
effect from time to time (the " _By-laws_ "). The election of directors need
not be by written ballot unless the By-laws shall so require.

7. In furtherance and not in limitation of the power conferred upon the Board
of Directors by law, the Board of Directors shall have power to make, adopt,
alter, amend and repeal from time to time the By-laws of this corporation,
subject to the right of the stockholders entitled to vote with respect
thereto to alter and repeal by-laws made by the Board of Directors. 8\. To the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, or any
comparable successor law, as the same may be amended and supplemented from
time to time, this corporation (i) may indemnify any persons whom it shall
have power to indemnify thereunder from and against any and all of the
expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered thereby,
(ii) shall indemnify each such person if he or she is or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of this corporation or because he or she was
serving this corporation or any other legal entity in any capacity at the
request of this corporation while a director, officer, employee or agent of
this corporation and (iii) shall pay the expenses of such current or former
director, officer, employee or agent incurred in connection with any such
action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such expenses if
it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification; and provided, however, that no such expenses shall be so paid
in advance by this corporation without approval of the Board of Directors if
the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding relates in any way to an
alleged act of fraud or moral terpitude. The indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, contract or vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (however embodied) of
any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his or
her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Any repeal or
modification of the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 8, by amendment of
this Paragraph 8 or by operation of law, shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director, officer, employee or agent of this corporation or
other person existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any
director of this corporation with respect to, any acts or omissions of such
director, officer, employee, agent or other person occurring prior to such
repeal or modification.

9\. A director of this corporation shall not be personally liable to this
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directorÂ’s
duty of loyalty to this corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of this corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so
amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article by the stockholders of
this corporation shall be by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less
than a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote in the election of directors, considered for the purposes of
this Paragraph 9 as one class, shall be prospective only and shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of any director of this corporation
existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

 

 10\. This corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain, at its
expense, insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against any expense, liability or loss asserted against such
person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of
such personÂ’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the DGCL or the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation.

11\. The books of this corporation may (subject to any statutory requirements)
be kept outside the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of
Directors or in the by-laws of this corporation.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

352 Knotter Drive

 

Cheshire, CT 06410

 

 _   _, 2011

[StockholdersÂ’ Representative Name] (" _you_ " or " _Recipient_ ")

 

[Address]

Dear [StockholdersÂ’ Representative Name]:

Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December
28, 2011 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Alexion Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (" _Alexion_ "), Enobia Pharma Corp. (" _Enobia_ "), EMRD Corporation
(the " _MergerSub_ "), and, only for certain limited purposes described
therein, each of the persons identified as StockholdersÂ’ Representatives
(collectively, the " _Stockholder Representatives_ "). Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Alexion or
Surviving Corporation will disclose Confidential Information (as defined
below) to the Recipient, and pursuant to Section 2.6(f) of the Merger
Agreement, the Recipient has agreed to enter into this Agreement to govern the
use and disclosure of Confidential Information in connection with RecipientÂ’s
duties as a Stockholder Representative under the Merger Agreement.

" _Confidential Information_ " shall mean any and all information disclosed
by or on behalf of Alexion or the Surviving Corporation to Recipient after the
Effective Time, including without limitation, (i) any information regarding
Alexion, MergerSub, Enobia and the Surviving Corporation, or the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any information made available to
Recipient pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Merger Agreement (other than the fact
that any Milestone has, or has not, been achieved), and (iii) all analyses,
compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents prepared by Recipient or
any of its Representatives (defined below) which contain, reflect or are based
on any of such information. Confidential Information also includes (a) the
fact that Confidential Information has been made available under this
Agreement and (b) any facts with respect to the definition of Purpose,
including the status thereof.

 

Confidential Information shall not include any information which (a) is
publicly known at the time of disclosure hereunder or (b) later becomes
publicly known through no breach of this Agreement by the Recipient. Recipient agrees not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other
than (a) to inform Company Equityholders from time to time (i) whether any
Milestone has or has not been achieved, (ii) the amount of any Milestone
Payment received, (iii) whether there are any claims for indemnification or
Dispute Notices under the Merger Agreement and (iv) the status of each of the
foregoing, and (b) in connection with the enforcement of Section 2.6 and the
enforcement and defense of indemnification claims under Article IX of the
Merger Agreement (collectively the " _Purpose_ "). Recipient agrees not to
disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity except to (i)
those of RecipientÂ’s legal and financial advisors who need to know
such information in connection with the Purpose (collectively "
_Representatives_ ") (it being understood that such Representatives will be
informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and will
agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as if a party
hereto), (ii) any other Stockholder Representative that has signed an
agreement substantially identical to this Agreement, (iii) with the written
consent of Alexion, or (iv) as required by law (and then with prior notice to
Alexion unless prohibited by law). You shall be responsible for any failure to
comply with the terms of this Agreement by your Representatives and you will
take all reasonable measures to restrain your Representatives from
unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient shall be permitted to disclose to the
Company Equityholders whether any Milestone has or has not been achieved, the
amount of any Milestone Payment received, whether any claims for
indemnification have been made or Dispute Notices given under the Merger
Agreement and the reports provided to Recipient pursuant to Section 2.6(d) of
the Merger Agreement.

 

This Agreement and the Merger Agreement contain all agreements between the
parties hereto relating to the Confidential Information and any promise or
condition concerning the same which is not contained herein, therein, or in a
superseding written agreement referring to this Agreement shall not be binding
on either party hereto.

 

You agree that Alexion, in addition to any other remedies available to it,
shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction, in the
event of your breach (either actual or threatened) of this Agreement (without
necessity of posting any bond or other security or proving special damages),
and you shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the grounds
that Alexion has an adequate remedy at law.

All Confidential Information, whether created by Alexion, Enobia, MergerSub,
the Surviving Corporation, or Recipient, shall be the property of Alexion,
Enobia, MergerSub or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable), and no license
or other rights to Confidential Information is granted or implied hereby.

 

Recipient may only make such copies of written, recorded, or machine-readable
Confidential Information as are reasonable in light of the Purpose. All such
Confidential Information, and all copies thereof, shall be held as
Confidential Information under the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 



-2-  You hereby acknowledge that you are aware, and that you will advise your
Representatives who are informed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, that the U.S. securities laws prohibit any person who has received
from an issuer material non-public information concerning the matters which
are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities of
such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely
to purchase or sell such securities.

 

It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by Alexion in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver
thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between you
and Alexion concerning the confidentiality of the Confidential Information,
and no modifications of this Agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions
hereof will be binding upon Recipient or Alexion, unless approved in writing
by each of Recipient and Alexion. The MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation
are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, entitled to enforce
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

The restrictions on RecipientÂ’s disclosure and use of any Confidential
Information shall terminate five (5) years after the date of last disclosure
of any Confidential Information to Recipient hereunder.

Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning to
Alexion a copy of this Agreement.

[The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank.]

 



-3-  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

ESCROW AGREEMENT

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (as the same may be amended or modified from time to
time pursuant hereto, this "Escrow Agreement") is made and entered into as of
_ _  _ _, 2012, by and among Alexion Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), M. Luc Mainville, Jonathan
Silverstein, Robert Heft and David Bonita (the "Stockholder Representatives")
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the "Escrow Agent"). The Buyer
and the Stockholder Representatives are sometimes referred to individually as
a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

 

WHEREAS, the Buyer and Enobia Pharma Corp., a Delaware corporation (the

December 28, 2011, by and among the Buyer, EMRD Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory
Subsidiary"), the Company and the Stockholder Representatives (as amended
from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Transitory
Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the
Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer
(the "Surviving Corporation"); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Parties have agreed to deposit
in escrow certain funds and wish such deposit to be subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

2\. Establishment of Escrow. The Merger Agreement provides for and the
stockholders of the Company have consented to, by virtue of their approval of
the Merger Agreement (a) the establishment of the escrow arrangements set
forth in this Escrow Agreement and (b) the appointment of the Stockholder
Representatives as the representatives of the Company Equityholders for
purposes of this Escrow Agreement, and the taking by the Stockholder
Representatives of any and all actions and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken or made by them under this Escrow Agreement.
The Stockholder Representatives shall act by majority vote on all matters
arising under this Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any
notice provided by a majority of the Stockholder Representatives.

3\. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their
escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 

4\. Escrow Amount; Additions to Escrow Fund.

(a) Escrow Amount. The Buyer agrees to deposit with the Escrow Agent an
aggregate amount equal to $[ ] (the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow
Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount and, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Amount and the proceeds thereof
(the outstanding balance of such amount, together with all
interest, dividends, distributions and other payments thereon, as held by the
Escrow Agent from time to time, the "Escrow Fund") as directed in Section 5\. (b) Additions to the Escrow Fund. Section 9.6 of the Merger Agreement
provides that, in the circumstances defined therein, the Buyer may deposit
additional funds in the Escrow Fund after the Effective Time (each such
additional deposit, an "Escrow Account Addition"). The Escrow Agent will
promptly acknowledge receipt of any Escrow Account Addition to the Buyer and
the Stockholder Representatives in accordance with the notice provisions set
forth in Section 12 of this Escrow Agreement. The Buyer will provide the
Escrow Agent with written notification in advance of each Escrow Account
Addition.

5\. Investment of Escrow Fund. During the term of this Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Fund shall be invested in accordance with the written instructions of
the Parties in "Permitted Investments," defined as (a) a JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. money market deposit account ("MMDA") or a successor or similar
investment offered by the Escrow Agent, (b) (i) investments in marketable
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States of America that mature
within one (1) year from the date of purchase or a fund substantially
comprising such securities, and (ii) investments in demand deposits and
certificates of deposit of any United States commercial bank or trust company
having capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000, or (c) as otherwise
instructed in writing jointly by the Parties and as shall be acceptable to
the Escrow Agent, provided, however, that "Permitted Investments" shall not
include any investment the earnings on which are subject to withholding of tax
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as determined by the
Parties. The rate of return on the Permitted Investments varies from time to
time based upon market conditions. Written investment instructions, if any,
shall specify the type and identity of the investments to be purchased and/or
sold. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of
investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets
operations or those of any affiliated entity on their respective standard
terms and conditions. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive
compensation with respect to any investment directed hereunder including
without limitation charging an agency fee in connection with each transaction,
in each case, on their respective standard terms and conditions. The Parties
recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not provide supervision,
recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of moneys held in
the Escrow Fund or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any
investment described herein. The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for
any loss sustained as a result of any investment in an investment made
pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement or as a result of any
liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the

Amount (and the Escrow Account Additions, if applicable). The Escrow Agent
shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide
funds necessary to make required payments under this Escrow Agreement.

 



\- 2 -  6\. Disposition and Termination.

 

(a) Claims on Escrow Fund. At any time prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on
the Business Day prior to [ ]1 (the "Escrow
Expiration Date"), the Buyer may deliver to the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholder Representatives a notice in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_
making a claim for payment of a portion of the Escrow Fund with respect to any
claim for indemnification by the Buyer under the Merger Agreement ("Claimed
Loss"). If the Stockholder Representatives do not object in writing by 5:00
p.m., Eastern time, on the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery of such
notice to the Escrow Agent, then the full amount of the Claimed Loss set forth
in such notice shall be disbursed to the Buyer in accordance with _Exhibit
A_. If the Stockholder Representatives agree in writing to the payment of all
or a portion of the Claimed Loss by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the thirtieth
(30th) day after the delivery of such notice to the Escrow Agent, then the
Escrow Agent shall (i) disburse to the Buyer the portion (if any) of the
Claimed Loss to which the Stockholder Representatives agree (the "Agreed
Amount") in accordance with _Exhibit A_ and (ii) hold the amount of the
Claimed Loss less the Agreed Amount until the Escrow Agent receives either (A)
a joint written instruction from both Parties or (B) a certified copy of a
final, non-appealable order or judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction,
a copy of which is delivered to the Escrow Agent by either the Buyer or the
Stockholder Representatives, that instructs the Escrow Agent as to the
disbursement of all or some of the Claimed Loss. The delivery to the
Escrow Agent of a court order shall constitute a representation to the Escrow
Agent by the Party delivering such order that such order constitutes a final
and non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction and that such
order complies with the requirements of this Section 6(a) and that the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely thereon without any further duty of inquiry.

(b) Final Release of Escrow Fund. Except as otherwise provided herein, on the
Escrow Expiration Date, any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be
released by the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement (i) to the Paying
Agent, in the case of amounts to be distributed to the holders of Company
Stock, for further distribution (reduced by any applicable withholding) to the
holders of Company Stock and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation, in the case
of amounts to be distributed to the holders of Company Options, for further
distribution (reduced by any applicable withholding) to the holders of Company
Options, in each case such further distribution to be in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule. Prior to such release, the Stockholder
Representatives shall provide to the Escrow Agent (x) a schedule setting forth
the amount to be released to the Paying Agent and the amount to be released to
the Surviving Corporation and (y) written wire payment instructions for the
Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Escrow Agreement to the contrary, if prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the
Business Day prior to the Escrow Expiration Date, the Buyer has delivered to
Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representatives a notice in substantially the
form of _Exhibit A_ , the payment to be made on the Escrow Expiration Date
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such
unresolved indemnification claims made by the Buyer. For avoidance of doubt,
promptly upon the resolution of any such unresolved indemnification claim, any
amounts in the Escrow Fund which are no longer subject to an unresolved
indemnification claim shall be paid to the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or
chargeable with having any knowledge of the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule and shall act solely on the written instruction delivered by the
Stockholder Representatives.

(c) Upon delivery of the entire Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with this Agreement, this Escrow Agreement shall terminate, subject to the
provisions of Sections 9 and 10.

 



   1  | Note to draft: insert one year anniversary of the Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



\- 3 -  (d) The Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, as
directed in written instructions signed by the Buyer and the Stockholder
Representatives.

7\. Escrow Agent.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and
expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither
be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any
requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement,
instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any,
including without limitation the Merger Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent
be required to determine if any person or entity has complied with any such
agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be
inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may
be made in this Escrow Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the
terms and provisions of this Escrow Agreement, those of the Merger Agreement,
any schedule or exhibit attached to the Escrow Agreement, or any other
agreement among the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement
shall control. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for
acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document,
instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Party or Parties
without inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party, any beneficiary or other
person for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth,
claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, unless such
instruction shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
Section 13 below and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any
applicable security procedures as may be required thereunder. The Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity,
accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it
or the Escrow Fund, including, without limitation, the Escrow Amount or Escrow
Fund Additions, nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to
confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with
it hereunder.

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that a final
adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow
AgentÂ’s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any
loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and
perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through attorneys, and shall
be liable only for the gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally
adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction) of any such attorney. The
Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons
to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with,
or in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or
other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain
or believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties or rights hereunder or
shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it
shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation
shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be given a
direction in writing by the Parties which eliminates such ambiguity or

 



\- 4 -   uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent or by a final and non-
appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties
agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute
without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same. Anything in this Escrow
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent
be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss
or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action.

 

8\. Succession; Removal.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or
obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in writing of
such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such resignation shall
take effect. If the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent
prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following receipt of the
notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the Parties. The Escrow AgentÂ’s sole responsibility after such thirty
(30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Fund (without any
obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated
substitute escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a
final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of
delivery the Escrow AgentÂ’s obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate,
subject to the provisions of Sections 9 and 10 hereunder. The Escrow Agent
shall have the right to withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing
to the Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent shall
reasonably believe may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
termination of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Buyer and the Stockholder Representatives, acting together, shall
have the right to terminate the appointment of the Escrow Agent, specifying
the date upon which such termination shall take effect. After such date, the
Escrow Agent shall have no further obligation hereunder except to hold the
Escrow Fund as depository. The Buyer and the Stockholder Representatives
agree that they will jointly appoint a successor escrow agent effective with
the termination of the Escrow Agent hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall refrain
from taking any action until it shall receive joint written instructions from
the Buyer and the Stockholder Representatives designating the successor escrow
agent. The Escrow Agent shall deliver all of the Escrow Fund to such successor
escrow agent in accordance with such instructions and upon receipt of the
Escrow Fund, the successor escrow agent shall be bound by all of the
provisions hereof.

(c) Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all
the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.

9\. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Parties shall be responsible for (a)
paying the Escrow Agent for the services to be rendered hereunder, along with
any fees or charges for accounts, including those levied by any governmental
authority which the Escrow Agent may impose, charge or pass-through, which
unless otherwise agreed in writing shall be as described in  _Schedule 2_
attached hereto, and (b) paying or reimbursing the Escrow Agent upon request
for all

 



\- 5 -   expenses, disbursements and advances, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and expenses, incurred or made by it in connection
with the performance, modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement.
All amounts payable to the Escrow Agent under this Section 9 shall be paid by
the Buyer.

10. Indemnity. The Buyer shall indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow
Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, agents and
employees (the "indemnitees") from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, litigation,
investigations, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel) (collectively "Losses")
arising out of or in connection with (a) the Escrow AgentÂ’s execution and
performance of this Escrow Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the
enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Escrow
Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the
indemnitee, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such
Losses are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or other directions, whether
joint or singular, from the Parties, except to the extent that its following
any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof.
The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive
the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination
of this Escrow Agreement.

11\. Patriot Act Disclosure/Taxpayer Identification Numbers/Tax Reporting.

 

(a) Patriot Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires the Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge
that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow AgentÂ’s identity
verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which
may be used to confirm the Parties identity including without limitation name,
address and organizational documents ("identifying information"). The Parties
agree to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent
obtaining from third parties any such identifying information required as a
condition of opening an account with or using any service provided by the
Escrow Agent.

(b) Taxpayer Identification Numbers ("TINs"). The Parties have provided the
Escrow Agent with their respective fully executed Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") Form W-8, W-9 and/or other required documentation.

 

(c) Tax Reporting. In addition, all interest or other income earned under the
Escrow Agreement shall be allocated to the Buyer and reported, as and to the
extent required by law, by the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing
authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income
earned from the Escrow Amount (and the Escrow Account Additions,
if applicable) by the Buyer whether or not said income has been distributed
during such year. Any other tax returns required to be filed will be prepared
and filed by the Stockholder Representatives and/or the Buyer with the IRS and
any other taxing authority as required by law, including but not limited to
any applicable reporting or withholding pursuant to

 



\- 6 -   the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act ("FIRPTA"). The Stockholder
Representatives and the Buyer acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Agent
shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any tax
return or any applicable FIRPTA reporting or withholding with respect to the
Escrow Amount (and the Escrow Account Additions, if applicable) or any income
earned by the Escrow Amount (and the Escrow Account Additions, if
applicable). The Stockholder Representatives and the Buyer further acknowledge
and agree that any taxes payable from the income earned on the investment of
any sums held with respect to the Escrow Amount (and the Escrow
Account Additions, if applicable) shall be reported to and paid by the Buyer.
In the absence of written direction from the Stockholder Representatives and
the Buyer, all proceeds of the Escrow Fund attributable to the Escrow Amount
(and the Escrow Account Additions, if applicable) shall be retained in the
Escrow Fund and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow Agent as provided
in this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes required
by applicable law, including but not limited to required withholding in the
absence of proper tax documentation, and shall remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities. The Parties hereby represent and warrant that such
underlying transaction does not constitute an installment sale requiring any
tax reporting or withholding of imputed interest or original issue discount by
the Escrow Agent to the IRS or other United States taxing authority.

12\. Notices. All communications hereunder shall be in writing and except for
communications from the Parties setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting
to, or in any way related to the transfer or distribution of funds, including
but not limited to funds transfer instructions (all of which shall be
specifically governed by Section 13 below), shall be deemed to be duly given

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to the
Escrow Agent, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the
date received by an officer of the Escrow Agent or any employee of the Escrow
Agent who reports directly to any such officer at the above-referenced office.
In the event that the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine
that an emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use such other means of
communication as the Escrow Agent deems appropriate. "Business Day" shall mean
any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the Escrow
Agent located at the notice address set forth above is authorized or required
by law or executive order to remain closed.

13. Security Procedures. Any instructions setting forth, claiming,
containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or
distribution of the Escrow Fund, must be in writing or set forth in a Portable
Document Format ("PDF"), executed by the appropriate Party or Parties as
evidenced by the signatures of the person or persons signing this Agreement or
one of their designated persons (each an "Authorized Representative") as set
forth on Schedule 1 hereto ("Schedule 1"), and delivered to the Escrow Agent
only by confirmed facsimile or attached to an email on a Business Day only at
the fax number or email address set forth in Section 12 above. No instruction
for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Fund shall be
deemed delivered and effective unless the Escrow Agent actually shall have
received it on a Business

 



\- 8 -   Day by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email only at the fax number or
email address set forth in Section 12 and as evidenced by a confirmed
transmittal to the PartyÂ’s or PartiesÂ’ transmitting fax number or email
address, and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security
procedures as may be required hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to any Party or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction
for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Fund if delivered
to any other fax number or email address, including but not limited to a valid
email address of any employee of Escrow Agent.

 

In the event funds transfer instructions are given, whether in writing, by
facsimile or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation
of such instructions by telephone call-back to the Authorized
Representatives, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and
telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually
received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable
to contact any of the Authorized Representatives identified in _Schedule 1_ ,
the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such
instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of the BuyerÂ’s
executive officers ("Executive Officers"), as the case may be, which shall
include the title of General Counsel, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such
"Executive Officer" shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed
incumbency certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and
the beneficiaryÂ’s bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Buyer or the
Stockholder Representatives to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the
beneficiaryÂ’s bank, or (c) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply
any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using any such
identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other than the
beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the
beneficiaryÂ’s bank or an intermediary bank designated. The Parties acknowledge
that these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

14\. Compliance with Court Orders. In the event that any escrow property shall
be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery
thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the
property deposited under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all
writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties
or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such
compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

15\. Miscellaneous. Except for changes to funds transfer instructions as
provided in Section 13, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be
waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a
writing signed by the Escrow Agent and the Parties. Neither this Escrow
Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or
in part by the Escrow Agent or any Party, except as provided in Section 8,
without the prior consent of the Escrow Agent and the other parties. This
Escrow Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the
State of New York. To the extent that in any jurisdiction either Party may
now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from
suit, execution

 



\- 9 -   attachment (before or after judgment), or other legal process, such Party
shall not claim, and it hereby irrevocably waives, such immunity. Each Party
irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-
conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of
process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and
consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New
York. The Parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with
respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this
Escrow Agreement. No party to this Escrow Agreement is liable to any other
party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under
the terms of this Escrow Agreement because of acts of God, fire, war,
terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission
failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Escrow Agreement
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. All signatures of the parties to this Escrow Agreement may
be transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF or other attachment to an electronic
transmission, and such facsimile or PDF or other attachment will, for all
purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature
it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this
Escrow Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of
any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction.
A person who is not a party to this Escrow Agreement shall have no right to
enforce any term of this Escrow Agreement. The parties represent, warrant and
covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request provided by
such Party to the Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and
regulations. Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such applicable
law may be waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the parties hereto to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this Escrow Agreement
shall be enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in Section 10
above, nothing in this Escrow Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
construed to give to any person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and the
Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in
respect of this Escrow Agreement or any funds escrowed hereunder.

in exchange for such stockholderÂ’s Certificate(s) formerly representing Shares
until the Certificate(s) owned by such stockholder is/are received by the
Paying Agent at the address set forth above, together with such documents as
the Paying Agent may require, and until the same are processed for payment by
the Paying Agent. No interest will accrue on any amounts due.

1\. _Guarantee of Signatures_. No signature guarantee on this Letter of
Transmittal is required (i) if this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder of the Certificate(s) surrendered herewith, and such holder
has not completed either the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" or
the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal
or (ii) if the Certificate(s) is to be surrendered for the account of an
eligible guarantor institution such as a commercial bank, trust company,
securities broker/dealer, credit union or a savings association participating
in a Medallion Program approved by the Securities Transfer Association, Inc.
(each of the foregoing being an "Eligible Institution"). In all other cases,
all signatures on the Letter of Transmittal must be medallion guaranteed by
an Eligible Institution.

2\. _Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificates_. This Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with the
Certificate(s), should be delivered to the Paying Agent at the address set
forth in this Letter of Transmittal.

 

The method of delivery of Certificate(s) and any other required documents is
at the election and risk of the owner. However, if Certificate(s) are sent by
mail, it is recommended that they be sent by certified mail, properly insured,
with return receipt requested. Risk of loss and title of the Certificate(s)
shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificate(s) to the Paying Agent.

In the event that the Paying Agent determines that any Letter of Transmittal
does not appear to have been properly completed or executed, or that a
Certificate does not appear to be in proper form for surrender, or any other
irregularity in connection with the surrender appears to exist, the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to consult with Buyer for further instructions.
Stockholders entitled to payment in excess of $500,000 in Merger Consideration
may be contacted directly by the Paying Agent and requested to provide any
missing or incomplete information. The Paying Agent reserves the right to
reject all other such incomplete or irregular presentations directly to the
stockholder. If there are any discrepancies between the number of Shares that
any Letter of Transmittal, Certificate or other supporting document may
indicate are owned by a stockholder and the number of shares of capital stock
of the Company that the Closing Date Allocation Schedule provided by the
Company to the Paying Agent indicates such stockholder owned of record, the
Paying Agent shall consult with Buyer for instructions as to the number of
shares of capital stock of the Company, if any, it is authorized to accept for
payment, and in the absence of such instructions, the Paying Agent is not
authorized to make payment and shall, except as thereafter directed in
writing by Buyer, continue to hold any Certificates surrendered in connection
therewith, this Letter of Transmittal and any other supporting documents
received with such Certificates. A surrender will not be deemed to have been
made until all irregularities have been cured or waived.

3\. _Inadequate Space_. If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
Certificate numbers and the number of Shares formerly represented thereby
should be listed on a separate schedule attached hereto.

4\. _Signature on Letter of Transmittal, Stock Powers and Endorsements_. If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder of the
Certificate(s) surrendered hereby, the signature must correspond exactly with
the name written on the face of the Certificate(s) without alteration,
enlargement or any change whatsoever. If the Certificate(s) surrendered hereby is owned of record by two or more
joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

If any surrendered Certificates are registered in different names on several
Certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many
separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of
Certificates.

 

When this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered owner(s) of the
Certificate(s) listed and surrendered hereby, no endorsements of the
Certificate(s) or separate stock powers are required.

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered
owner of the Certificate(s) listed, such Certificate(s) must be endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock power(s), in either case signed by the
registered owner or owners or a person with full authority to sign on behalf
of the registered owner. Signatures on such Certificate(s) or stock power(s)
must be medallion guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificate(s) or stock power(s) is
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or others acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing, and evidence
satisfactory to the Paying Agent of such personÂ’s authority to so act must be
submitted. The Paying Agent will not exchange any Certificate(s) until all
instructions herein are complied with.

5\. _Stock Transfer Taxes_. In the event that any transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration or other taxes becomes payable by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder, such transferee or assignee must pay such tax or must
establish that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Paying Agent
will have no responsibility with respect to transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration or other taxes.

 

6\. _Special Delivery Instructions_. Indicate the name and address of the
person(s) to whom the check comprising the Merger Consideration is to be sent
if different from the name and address of the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal.

7.  _Form W-9_. Each surrendering stockholder is required to provide the
Paying Agent with such holderÂ’s correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN")
on the Form W-9 included herein, and to certify whether the stockholder
is subject to backup withholding. Failure to provide such information or an
adequate basis for exemption on the form may subject the surrendering
stockholder to United States federal backup withholding on cash payments made
to such surrendering stockholder with respect to the Certificate(s). If such
holder is an individual, the TIN is his or her social security number. A
holder must cross out item (2) in Part II of Form W-9 if such holder is
subject to backup withholding. The Paying Agent will withhold at a rate not
to exceed 28% on all payments made prior to the time a properly certified TIN
is provided to the Paying Agent.

8\. _Appointment of Stockholder Representatives_. By signing and submitting
this Letter of Transmittal, or by accepting any Merger Consideration for his,
her or its Shares, the stockholder confirms and agrees to the appointment of
the Stockholder Representatives as such stockholderÂ’s representatives,
attorneys-in-fact and agents in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement and the related escrow agreement (the "Escrow
Agreement") and in any litigation or arbitration involving the Merger
Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement. In connection therewith, the
Stockholder Representatives, acting by simple majority, are authorized to do
or refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents as the Stockholder Representatives shall deem necessary or
appropriate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the stockholder
authorizes and empowers the Stockholder Representatives to (i) act for the
equity holders of the Company with regard to all matters pertaining to the
Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (ii) execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements, certificates and
documents that the Stockholder Representatives deem necessary or appropriate
in connection with the transactions  contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (iii) receive
funds, make payments of funds and give receipts for funds and (iv) give and
receive all notices required to be given or received by the equity holders of
the Company under the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

9\. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate(s)_. If your Certificate(s) has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, please complete the Lost Certificate Affidavit
and Indemnity Agreement enclosed with this Letter of Transmittal. An affidavit
of loss must be properly completed and returned, to the Paying Agent.

10\. _Information and Additional Copies_. Information and additional
copies of this Letter of Transmittal may be obtained from the Paying Agent by
writing to the address above or calling the Paying Agent at 1-800-318-5202. IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

 

Under United States federal tax laws, a holder who receives cash payments
pursuant to the Merger is required to provide the Paying Agent (as payer)
with such holderÂ’s correct TIN on the Form W-9 above (or otherwise establish a
basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify under penalty of
perjury that such TIN is correct and that such holder is not subject
to backup withholding. If such holder is an individual, the TIN is his or her
social security number. If the Paying Agent is not provided with the correct
TIN, a $50 penalty may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, and the
payment of any cash pursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup
withholding.

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and
foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding
and reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status
on Form W-9. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, such individual must submit a Form W-8 BEN (or other appropriate
Form W-8), signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such individualÂ’s
exempt status. A Form W-8 BEN can be obtained from the Paying Agent or at the
link below. Please note that there are additional Form W-8Â’s if the W-8BEN
does not apply to your particular situation. The additional forms can be
accessed at the following IRS links:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf

 

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8eci.pdf

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8imy.pdf

 

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8exp.pdf

If backup withholding applies, the Paying Agent is required to withhold at a
rate not to exceed 28% of any payments made to the holder or other payee.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the Federal income tax
liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld provided that the required information is given to the
IRS. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.

Purpose of Form W-9

 

To prevent backup withholding on payments made with respect to Certificate(s),
the holder is required to notify the Paying Agent of such holderÂ’s correct
TIN by completing the form above, certifying that (1) the TIN provided on the
Form W-9 is correct (or that such holder is awaiting a TIN), (2) such holder
is not subject to backup withholding because (a) such holder is exempt from
backup withholding, (b) such holder has not been notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that he is subject to backup withholding as a result of a
failure to report all interest or dividends or (c) the Internal Revenue
Service has notified such holder that such holder is no longer subject to
backup withholding and (3) such holder is a U.S. citizen or other person
(including a U.S. resident alien). What Number to Give the Paying Agent

 

The holder is required to give the Paying Agent the TIN (i.e., social security
number or employer identification number) of the holder receiving payment of
Merger Consideration in exchange for the Certificate(s) tendered hereby. If
the Certificate(s) are held in more than one name or are not held in the name
of the actual owner, consult the instructions following the Form W-9
for additional guidance on which number to report.
