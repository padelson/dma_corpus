Section 1.5.

 

 _Assignment of Contracts and Rights_

 

. 

 

(a)

 

The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assume and assign the
Assumed Contracts and other Purchased Assets to Buyer (including payment by
the

 


  

 

\- 4 -

  

 



 

Sellers of any Cure Costs that are not the responsibility of Buyer to pay
pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_), including using commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate any negotiations with the counterparties to such Assumed
Contracts and to obtain an order (which shall be the Approval Order)
containing a finding that the proposed assignment to and assumption of the
Assumed Contracts by Buyer satisfied all applicable requirements of Section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

(b)

 

At the Closing (i) the Sellers shall, pursuant to the Approval Order and the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of
Lease, as applicable, assume and assign to Buyer (the consideration of which
is included in the Final Purchase Price) each of the Assumed Contracts that is
capable of being assumed and assigned and (ii) Buyer shall pay (x) all Cure
Costs (if any) specified by the Sellers on the Estimated Closing Statement to
the extent taken into account as a Current Liability in the calculation of the
Estimated Net Working Capital and (y) any additional Cure Costs up to the Cure
Costs Cap, in each case in connection with such assumption and assignment and
assume and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities (if any) under the
Assumed Contracts, pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the
Assignment and Assumption of Lease. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall
pay any Cure Costs not paid at the Closing to the extent such Cure Costs are
included as a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.8_), and any additional
Cure Costs (including any Cure Costs paid pursuant to clause (ii)(y) above) up
to the Cure Costs Cap, and the Sellers shall pay and be solely responsible for
any such additional Cure Costs in excess of the Cure Costs Cap.

 

(c)

 

 Except as to Assumed Contracts assigned pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code or the Approval Order, anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Purchased Asset or any right thereunder if an attempted assignment,
without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or in any way
adversely affect the rights of Buyer or the Sellers thereunder, and the
Sellers, at Buyers expense, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as possible. If such
consent is not obtained or such assignment is not attainable pursuant to
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or the Approval Order, or if any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyers rights under the
Purchased Asset in question so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the
benefit of all such rights, then the Sellers, to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law, shall act after the Closing, at Buyers request, as Buyers
agent in order to obtain for it the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate,
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, with Buyer in any other
reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer. No Seller
may agree to pay any amount to obtain any consent of a third party without
Buyers prior approval. All obligations of the Sellers under this _Section
1.5(c)_ shall expire on the date that is twelve months after the Closing Date.

 

Section 1.6.

 

 _Closing Date Payment_

 

. 

 

(a)

 

On the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, the total
consideration to be paid on the Closing Date for the Purchased Assets shall be
(x) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and (y) a cash payment (the "
_Cash Payment_ ") equal to the sum of:

 


  

 

\- 5 -

  

 



 

(i)

 

One Hundred Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($117,500,000)
(the " _Enterprise Value_ "); _plus_

 

(ii)

 

the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than
the Target Net Working Capital; _minus_

 

(iii)

 

the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than
the Target Net Working Capital.

 

At the Closing, Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Sellers an amount
equal to (A) the Cash Payment _less_ (B) the Escrow Amount (such amount, the "
_Closing Date Payment_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated by the Sellers at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b)

 

At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) an amount equal
to Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the " _Escrow
Amount_ ") with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, which Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent as available
funds for purposes of and until the payment of the Final Purchase Price in
accordance with _Section 1.8_ (all such funds, the " _Escrow Funds_ ") (and
the Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of any Taxes imposed on, and
shall be entitled to receipt of any interest or other income attributable to
any investments from, the Escrow Funds). The Escrow Funds shall only
constitute property of the Sellers bankruptcy estates in the event and to the
extent that the Escrow Funds are required to be released to the Sellers in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

 

(c)

 

No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Sellers good faith estimate of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "). The Estimated Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as applied in a manner
consistent with the accounting methods, policies, categorizations,
definitions, principles, practices, techniques and procedures that are
specified in the calculation of Net Working Capital as of June 30, 2016 set
forth in _Exhibit J_ (with the amounts included therein being for illustrative
purposes only), but shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as
a result of changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the Closing.

 

Section 1.7.

 

 _Closing_

 

. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to the provisions
of _Section 8.1_ , the closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place no later than the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those
conditions as of the Closing) set forth in _Article VIII_, unless another
time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties hereto (the date of the
Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of

and notify Buyer in writing prior to the expiration of the Review Period of
any dispute or objection thereto, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particular items of any such dispute or objection (such written notice, the "
_Objection_ "). If the Sellers have not notified Buyer of an Objection within
the Review Period, then the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Parties and shall become final, binding and conclusive. The
Sellers and Buyer shall, within ten (10) days (or such longer period as the
Sellers and Buyer may agree in writing) following delivery of an Objection to
Buyer (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences, all such discussions and communications related thereto shall
(unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Sellers) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, and any
resolution mutually agreed by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final,
binding and conclusive. Any items agreed to by the Sellers and Buyer in
writing, together with any items not disputed or objected to by the Sellers in

employees and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to make available its
accountants or other advisors that participated in the preparation of the
Closing Statement or the information contained therein. Buyer and the Sellers
shall cooperate with each other party and its or their representatives in
connection with their respective review of

 


  

 

\- 8 -

  

 



 

the Closing Statement and the Objection, as the case may be, including
providing on a timely basis all other information and copies of records or
other documents of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities necessary or
useful in connection with the review of the Closing Statement and the
Objection as is reasonably requested by such other Party or its or their
representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of Buyer or the
Sellers shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to Buyer or the
Sellers (as applicable) or their respective representatives except in
accordance with such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only
after such Person has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. 

 

(d)

 

If at the end of the Resolution Period the Sellers and Buyer have been unable
to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Objection, the Sellers and Buyer shall refer all matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Objection (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ")
to Ernst and Young (or if such firm is unable or unwilling to accept such
engagement, an internationally recognized independent public accounting firm
that has not provided material services to either Buyer or any of the Sellers
or their respective Affiliates in the preceding three (3) years as jointly
selected by the Sellers and Buyer or, if the Sellers and Buyer are unable to
agree within five (5) Business Days from the end of the Resolution Period,
then such internationally recognized independent public accounting firm
jointly selected by the Sellers and Buyers independent accountants within
five (5) Business Days thereafter) (such firm, as finally selected, the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). The Sellers and Buyer each agree to promptly sign an
engagement letter, in commercially reasonable form, as may reasonably be
required by the Accounting Firm. Each of Buyer and the Sellers shall submit
to the Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same
day), within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the engagement of the
Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting
forth their respective positions with respect to the Unresolved Matters. Each
of Buyer and the Sellers may (but shall not be required to) submit to the
Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day),
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the engagement of the
Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted
to the Accounting Firm by the other party. Unless requested by the Accounting
Firm in writing, no party hereto may present any additional information or
arguments to the Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. None of the
Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall
have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Accounting Firm
regarding the subject matter hereof without the other partys prior written
consent. The Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable access to all relevant
records of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities to calculate the
Closing Statement. The Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator and not as
an expert to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, and only with respect to the
Unresolved Matters submitted and without independent investigation, whether
and to what extent the Closing Statement requires adjustments and shall be
instructed that its calculation (A) must be made in strict accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and _Exhibit J_ , without regard to principles of
equity, and (B) with respect to each Unresolved Matter, must be within the
range of values established for such amount as determined by reference to the
value assigned to such amount by the Sellers in the Objection and by Buyer in
the Closing Statement. The Sellers and Buyer shall request the Accounting
Firm to (i) submit its final written determination to the Sellers and Buyer as
soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after
the Accounting

Firms engagement, and (ii) prepare the Final Closing Statement (which shall
be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the
Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters) and calculate the Final Purchase
Price based on such Final Closing Statement. The Accounting Firms final
written determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and
Buyer. The " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no
Objection is delivered by the Sellers to Buyer prior to the expiration of the
Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Sellers
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_, (ii) in the event that an Objection is
delivered by the Sellers to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 1.8(a)_ as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of the Sellers and
Buyer in writing or (iii) in the event that an Objection is delivered by the
Sellers to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period and the Sellers
and Buyer are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Objection, the
Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to _Section
1.8(a)_ as adjusted by the Accounting Firm to be consistent with the Resolved
Matters and the final determination of the Accounting Firm of the Unresolved
Matters in accordance with this _Section 1.8(d)_. In the event the Final
Closing Statement is determined (x) pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall prepare the Final Closing
Statement and calculate the Final Purchase Price, in each case, in strict
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to the
Sellers within three (3) Business Days following the determination thereof or
(y) pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Accounting Firm shall prepare the Final Closing Statement (which shall be
consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the
Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters) and calculate the Final Purchase
Price based on the Final Closing Statement, in each case, in strict accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to the Sellers and
Buyer within three (3) Business Days following the delivery of the final
written determination of the Accounting Firm to the Sellers and Buyer. The
date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally determined and delivered
in accordance with this _Section 1.8(d)_ is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Eligibility Date_ ". 

 

(e)

 

Buyer and the Sellers agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
1.8_ for resolving disputes with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit any party from
instituting litigation to enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof by
the Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction. The substance of
the Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent a showing of fraud. It is the intent of the Parties to have any
determination of Unresolved Matters by the Accounting Firm proceed in an
expeditious manner; _provided_ , _however_ , any deadline or time period
contained herein may be extended or modified by agreement of the Parties, and
the Parties agree that the failure of the Accounting Firm to strictly conform
to any deadline or time period contained herein shall not be a basis for
seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the Accounting Firm. Any
fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the Accounting Firm in respect
of its services pursuant to this _Section 1.8_ shall be shared by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, so that the Sellers share
of such fees and expenses shall be in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount that is unsuccessfully disputed by the Sellers bears to the total
amount initially disputed by the Sellers.

designated by the Sellers) within five (5) Business Days of the Eligibility
Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal
to the Final Purchase Price Increase Amount; or

 

(ii)

 

less than the Cash Payment (the absolute value of the difference between such
amounts, the " _Final Purchase Price Reduction Amount_ "): Buyer and the
Sellers shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the Eligibility Date) to deliver (x) an amount equal to
the Final Purchase Price Reduction Amount to Buyer (and the Sellers shall
deliver to Buyer any amount in excess of the Escrow Funds required to pay in
full the Final Purchase Price Reduction Amount) and (y) the remainder (if any)
of the Escrow Funds to the Sellers.

 

(h)

payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it determines it is

activities at its expense and in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Sellers; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Sellers determine, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the Sellers to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information;

 


  

 

\- 36 -

  

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties hereto shall attempt in good faith
to make such alternative arrangements as may be reasonably necessary so that
the restrictions in the immediately preceding proviso would not apply. Each
Party hereto will hold any such information that is nonpublic in confidence to
the extent required hereby and by, and in accordance with, the provisions of
that certain agreement, dated December 23, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between the Company and Buyer. 

 

(b)

 

The Sellers and Buyer agree that each of them shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve and keep (i) in the case of Sellers, the Books
and Records of the Sellers for periods prior to the Closing and (ii) in the
case of Buyer, the records held by Buyer or its Affiliates relating to the
Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, in each case,
until the later of the closing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the liquidation and
winding up of the Sellers estates (but in no event later than three (3) years
after the Closing Date) and shall make such records available to the other
party(ies) as may be reasonably required by such other party(ies) in
connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, actions or tax
audits against or governmental investigations of the Sellers or Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates or in order to enable the Sellers or Buyer to
comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents and each other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event the Sellers or Buyer wish to
destroy such records at the end of such preservation period, such party shall
first give thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party(ies) and
such other party(ies) shall have the right at its (or their) option and
expense, upon prior written notice given to such party(ies) within such thirty
(30) day period, to take possession of the records within forty-five (45) days
after the date of such notice, or such shorter period as the liquidation and
winding up of the Sellers estates shall permit.

 

(c)

 

Until the closing of the Chapter 11 Cases, Buyer shall give the Sellers
reasonable access, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
written notice, to Buyers officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
contracts and records pertaining to (i) the conduct of the Business or
ownership of the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the
Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities, in order for the Sellers to
effect the wind down of their Chapter 11 estates, including, reconciling and
objecting to claims in the Chapter 11 Cases and compiling and filing tax

Representatives to furnish to the Sellers such financial, technical, operating
and other information pertaining to (A) the conduct of the Business or
ownership of the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date or (B) the
Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities, in each case, as the Sellers
shall from time to time reasonably request in a written notice and to discuss
such information with such Representatives in order for the Sellers to effect
the wind down of their Chapter 11 estates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be required to provide such access or information if Buyer
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable
Law or a contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party,
jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose Buyer to
risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall attempt in good faith to make
such alternative arrangements as may be reasonably necessary so that the
restrictions in the immediately preceding proviso would not apply.

related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or

proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
assets or businesses of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the
Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries and (B) otherwise taking or

freedom of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
Closing; _provided_ that none of Buyer, the Sellers or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business of Buyer, the Sellers or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or
order is binding on Buyer, the Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries
only in the event that the Closing occurs; _provided_ _further_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of Buyer, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or
submit to orders providing for the sale, divestiture or other disposition or
holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
material business, assets or categories of assets of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, or
seeking to impose any material limitation on the freedom or ability of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to conduct its business or own such assets or to

_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall, if necessary to secure termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act and if requested by the Sellers, offer
and agree to sell, divest or otherwise dispose or hold separate assets
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or the Sellers that have nominal monetary and strategic value to

to agree to any other remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or
restriction related to the conduct of its or the Sellers business in order to

about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers shall
agree to make or effect any divestitures, assign or hold separate any assets,
or implement any other remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or
restriction on the conduct of their business (in each case solely to the
extent implementation and effectiveness of such actions are contingent upon
the Closing) pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)_ to resolve any Governmental
Entitys or private partys objections to or concerns about the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent instructed in writing by
Buyer. For avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall not make or

 


  

 

\- 39 -

  

 



 

effect any divestitures, assign or hold separate any assets, or agree to or
implement any other remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or restriction
on the conduct of their business pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)_, unless so
instructed in writing by Buyer in order to resolve any Governmental Entitys
or private partys objections to or concerns about the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. During the period from the date hereof until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and the Closing, Buyer and the Sellers shall not (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) take or agree to take any
action that would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the
Closing, other than any actions expressly permitted to be taken by the Sellers
and Affiliates under this Agreement.

 

(c)

 

The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all registrations, filings, notifications,
communications, submissions, and any other material actions pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_, and, subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall keep each other apprised of the status of

material communications received by the Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the Sellers, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall permit counsel for the other
party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed notifications or
filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to any
such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any documents
submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the businesses of the Sellers, or proposals from third parties with respect
thereto and (ii) as necessary or appropriate to address reasonable privilege
concerns or reasonable confidentiality concerns relating to proprietary or
commercially sensitive information regarding Buyer and its operations;
_provided_ that Buyer shall contemporaneously provide summaries to the
Sellers counsel of the information redacted pursuant to this subclause (ii).
Each of the Sellers and Buyer agrees not to participate in any meeting or
substantive discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited or required otherwise by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate.

 

(d)

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained
in this _Section 6.2_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and, subject to _Section 6.2(b)_,
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents,
delays or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.2_ shall limit a

 


  

 

\- 40 -

  

 



 

Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or
_Section 8.1(c)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination,
complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.2_.

termination of this Agreement (and except as contemplated pursuant to the Bid
Procedures Order after entry thereof) (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "), none of
the Sellers shall, nor shall any of the Sellers authorize or permit any of its
or their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
representatives or advisors (such individuals, the " _Representatives_ ") to:
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate, or cooperate with
respect to, the preparation or submission of inquiries, proposals or offers
from any Person (other than Buyer) that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions, communications or negotiations in
connection with any Alternative Proposal or furnish to any Person any non-
public information with respect to the Sellers business, properties or assets
in connection with any Alternative Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other understandings (whether or not binding) regarding, or taking any
action to implement or facilitate, an Alternative Proposal. During the
Exclusivity Period (and except as contemplated pursuant to the Bid Procedures
Order after entry thereof), the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and terminate, any and
all existing activities, discussions, communications or negotiations with any
parties (other than Buyer or any of its Representatives) conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, any Alternative Proposal, (B) take
such action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or
provisions of similar effect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary
and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
standstill agreement (including any standstill provision contained in any
confidentiality or other agreement) to which it or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is a party. The Company shall promptly upon entry of the
Approval Order __ instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement relating to any Alternative Proposal with or for the
benefit of the Company to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information, documents and materials relating to an Alternative Proposal or to
the Sellers or their businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives to such Person or
any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person and terminate any "data room" or similar access of
such Persons and their Representatives. For purposes of this _Section 6.3_,
the term " _Person_ " means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the
Company, Buyer or any Subsidiaries of Buyer and, with respect to Buyer, the
Sellers.

 

(b)

review of, and reasonable approval by, Buyer) and by Buyer (subject to the
prior review

 


  

 

\- 41 -

  

 



 

of, and reasonable approval by, the Company) and thereafter Buyer and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press release
or otherwise making any public statement (to the extent not substantially
comparable to statements previously issued, in accordance herewith) with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each of the foregoing Parties
may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in documents required to be filed or furnished with the SEC, so
long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually,
if approved by the other party), and (b) a Party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue any such press release or make any such
public announcement or statement as may be required by requirements under Law.

 

Section 6.5.

 

 _Employee Matters_

 

.

 

(a)

 

Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall provide, or cause one of its Subsidiaries to
provide, offers of employment, to be effective as of the Closing Date, to all
employees (other than those referred to on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ ) who are
employed by any of the Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date,
including employees on temporary leave of absence (including family medical
leave, military leave and sick leave) or otherwise on an approved leave of
absence (but excluding any employees on long-term disability leave), in a
comparable position as they are employed as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Such employees who accept such offer of employment, and
commence active employment with Buyer or applicable Subsidiary on or following
the Closing are referred to as " _Transferred Employees_." Nothing in this
subsection (a), expressed or implied, shall confer upon any of the Transferred
Employees any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

 

(b)

 

During the period beginning at the Closing and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date or, if shorter, during the period of
employment of a Transferred Employee with Buyer or applicable Subsidiary,
Buyer shall provide, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to provide, such
Transferred Employees with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate that, in each
case, are no less favorable than those as were provided to such Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) to Transferred Employees,
collectively, employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to either
(x) the employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based compensation)
provided to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing or (y)
the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, as determined in the sole discretion of Buyer. Any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to provide, to each
Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries without cause (other than due to death or disability) during the
twelve (12) month period following the Closing, severance benefits equal to
either (x) the severance benefits provided for under the Sellers severance
arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Closing and disclosed on
_Schedule 2.17(a)_ or (y) the severance benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries under Buyers severance
arrangements, as determined in the sole discretion of Buyer.

 


  

 

\- 42 -

  

 



 

(c)

 

From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide all Transferred Employees with credit for service
with the Sellers earned prior to the Closing for eligibility and vesting (but
not for benefit accruals or benefits under any defined benefit pension plan,
post-employment welfare benefits, special or early retirement programs, window
separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect from time to time
( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, this parenthetical shall not
prevent, or in any way restrict or limit, the assumption by Buyer of the
Closing Company Change of Control PaymentBuyer Portion)) purposes in each
case under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement
in which the Transferred Employees participate on or after the Closing
(collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), except as would result in a duplication
of benefits. In addition, Buyer shall (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Transferred Employee under the comparable Seller Benefit Plan as of the date
on which commencement of participation in such New Plan begins, and (ii) cause
any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid during
the calendar year in which commencement of participation in such New Plan
begins and prior to such commencement of participation by any Transferred
Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes
of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions under such New Plan in the year of initial participation.

 

(d)

 

Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay (i) bonuses to
each Transferred Employee, at the same time that Buyer pays bonuses to its
other employees, with respect to the portion of the calendar year 2016 elapsed
prior to the Closing in an amount that is equal to the amount of accrued
bonuses taken into account as a Current Liability in the determination of Net
Working Capital, and (ii) amounts of accrued vacation or paid time off
attributable to each Transferred Employees employment or other service with
Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date as such vacation and time off is taken
by each respective Transferred Employee, to the extent such amounts have been
taken into account as a Current Liability in the determination of Net Working
Capital.

 

(e)

 

Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Sellers shall provide to Buyer all
information reasonably necessary to permit Buyer to perform its obligations
under this _Section 6.5_, including such information as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer following the Closing, and Sellers agreement to provide
such information shall survive the Closing for so long as Buyer remains
obligated to perform under this _Section 6.5_.

 

(f)

 

Sellers and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to adopt the "alternate
procedure for predecessors and successors" set forth in Section 5 of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004 34 IRB 320 with respect to Transferred Employees
providing services in the United States and, except as prohibited by
applicable Law, Sellers shall promptly provide Buyer with such information
regarding employment taxes paid for the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs with respect to the Transferred Employees as Buyer may reasonably
request.

 

(g)

 

Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Service Provider any right to continued employment for any
period or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall
constitute an amendment to or any other

 


  

 

\- 43 -

  

 



 

modification of any New Plan or Seller Benefit Plan or other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement. Further, this _Section
6.5_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the
Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.5_, express or
implied, is intended to create or confer upon any other Person (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Service Provider) any rights, benefits,
liabilities, obligations or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this _Section 6.5_.

 

Section 6.6.

 

 _Assets Wrongly Received_

 

. From and after the Closing, if any Seller or any of its Affiliates receives
or collects any funds relating to any Accounts Receivable or any other
Purchased Asset, such Seller or its Affiliate shall remit such funds to Buyer
as soon as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after
its receipt thereof. From and after the Closing, if Buyer or its Affiliate
receives or collects any funds relating to any Excluded Asset, Buyer or its
Affiliate shall remit any such funds to the Sellers as soon as practicable
(and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after its receipt thereof.

 

Section 6.7.

 

 _WARN Act Compliance_

 

. The Company shall provide to Buyer at the Closing a complete and accurate
list of all "employment losses" at any of the Sellers, as that term is defined
in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (or similar
state or local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" Law) (the " _WARN Act_ "),
which occurred in the 90 calendar days preceding the Closing, which list shows
the name, date of separation, reason for separation, and facility or operating
unit of each employee of any of the Sellers who suffered such an employment
loss in such period. The Sellers shall give all necessary WARN Act notices
with respect to employment losses that occur prior to the Closing Date with
respect to any employees employed by any of the Sellers.

 

Section 6.8.

 

 _Insurance_

 

. To the extent that any insurance policies, issued by any third party, of
the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates cover any Loss, Liability,
claim, damage or expense relating to any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liability
and such insurance policies continue after the Closing to permit claims to be
made thereunder with respect to events occurring prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in submitting and pursuing such
claims (and pursuing any claims previously made). Buyer shall pay all fees,
costs and deductibles in connection with any claim pursued pursuant to this
_Section 6.8_.

 

Section 6.9.

 

 _Bankruptcy Court Approval_

 

.

supplemented with the prior written consent of Buyer, authorizing and

Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code until paid other than (x) superpriority

Agreement.

be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, and no waiver by any Party hereto shall operate or be construed as a
waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified
