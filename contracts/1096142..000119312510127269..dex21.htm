Taxes;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,

Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance

thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger and shall continue to be governed by  the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware and (iii) the separate

Section 1.2. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL to give effect to the Merger as contemplated hereby.
The Merger shall become effective at the time such Certificate of Merger has

later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time._ "

Section 1.3. _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of  _Article VII_ , the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 9:00 a.m., local

applicable Laws) of the last to be satisfied of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP,

contained in this Agreement, the Closing shall not be on a date during the
period beginning on August 23, 2010 and ending on September 5, 2010 (the "
_Blackout Period_ "), and if the last to be satisfied of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions at the Closing) is satisfied or waived (to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws) during or less than two business days prior to
the Blackout Period, then the Closing will take place at 9:00 a.m., local
time, on the later to occur of (x) the second business day after such
satisfaction or waiver or (y) the first business day following the expiration
of the Blackout Period, unless another date is agreed to in writing by the

to applicable Laws, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to

Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Section 1.5.  _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,

directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES BY MERGER

 

Section 2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or holders of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other
than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into and thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable to the
holder thereof in cash, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, no
additional consideration shall be paid for any Company Rights. From and after
the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate formerly representing any such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.



 

-3- (d) _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect any change in the number of Shares issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time by reason of any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation,
reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital
structure; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.1(d)_
shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into
any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Merger Sub shall (i) designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the Company
Stockholders in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to
receive the funds to which the Company Stockholders shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.1 and (ii) _enter into a paying agent agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying
Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Article II. At the Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration for the
benefit of the Company Stockholders whose Shares will be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such funds
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the
Company Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost
portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a
level sufficient to make such payments. Earnings from such investments shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part
of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of the Company Stockholders.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event by no later than five (5) business days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and
whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are
reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed (or, if
such Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a
book-entry account 



 

-4-  statement; it being understood that any references herein to "
_Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of Shares), the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, which
Merger Consideration shall be paid or mailed within two (2) business days
after the Paying Agents receipt of such documents, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, then it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has
been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by _Section 2.1_ and this _Section
2.2_, without interest thereon.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company, other than transfers that occurred before the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Laws. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following nine (9)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws, as
general creditors thereof) for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.



 

-5- (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate
claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the
amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenters Provisions_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(c)_ but rather the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the Dissenters Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to an appraisal of such holders Shares under the Dissenters
Provisions, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as of the Effective Time as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Merger Sub of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal rights in respect of any Shares, and Merger Sub
shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, other than pursuant
to a court order, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Merger Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer
to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.4. _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and other Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares issued
by the Company under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (each, a " _Company
Option_ ") shall become or otherwise be deemed fully vested effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Option which remains issued and outstanding (including
those Company Options with respect to which the accelerated vesting described
in the preceding sentence applies) shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash determined
by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of the Option by (ii) the number of Shares subject
to such Option, less any amounts required to be withheld under applicable Laws
(the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that the product obtained by



 

-6-  such calculation with respect to a Company Option is zero or a negative
number, then such Company Option shall, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, be cancelled for no consideration. 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Share subject to restrictions on transfer
and/or forfeiture issued by the Company under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise, including those Shares subject to performance-based conditions ("
_Restricted Stock_ "), shall become or otherwise be deemed fully vested
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
each vested, issued and outstanding Share of Restricted Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof, less any amounts required to be withheld
under applicable Laws.

(c) At the Effective Time, each right to receive Shares in the future based on
the satisfaction of service or performance-based conditions or otherwise,
including, but not limited to, restricted stock units and performance shares
(but excluding Company Options), issued by the Company under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise (collectively, " _Restricted Stock Units_ ") shall become
or otherwise be deemed fully vested effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each vested
Restricted Stock Unit (including those Restricted Stock Units with respect to
which the accelerated vesting described in the preceding sentence applies)
which remains issued and outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash determined
by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Shares
subject to such Restricted Stock Unit, less any amounts required to be
withheld under applicable Laws (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). 

(d) Prior to the Effective time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate to reflect the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_, including the acceleration of vesting of outstanding awards
under the Company Stock Plans and the cancellation and conversion of Company
Options and Restricted Stock Units, subject to and effective on and as of the
Effective Time.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option
Consideration as contemplated in _Section 2.4(a)_ and the RSU Consideration
as contemplated in _Section 2.4(c)_, in each case, within five (5) business
days following the Closing Date.

or may have any material liability (contingent or otherwise), in each case,
for or to any current or former employees, directors, officers or consultants

any 



 

-13-  such Benefit Plans for any current or former employees, directors, officers
or consultants of the Company or any Company Subsidiary not located primarily
in the United States and/or their dependents.

(b) All Benefit Plans that are intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a)
and any trust agreement that is intended to be tax exempt under Code Section
501(a) have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified
under Code Section 401(a) and exempt from taxation under Code Section 501(a)
(or there remains a period of time under the applicable remedial amendment
period with respect to such a Benefit Plan to request such a determination),
and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that would
adversely affect the qualification of any such plan. Each Benefit Plan, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects

any Benefit Plan participant), and its terms and the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining or collective labor agreements. As of the date hereof,
no litigation has been commenced with respect to any Benefit Plan and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such litigation is threatened (other than
routine claims for benefits in the normal course). As of the date hereof,
there are no governmental audits or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in connection with any Benefit Plan. To

liabilities of the Company and properly reflected in the Financial Statements
of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Benefit Plan or any
applicable collective bargaining agreement and applicable Laws. To the
knowledge of the Company, no " _prohibited transaction_ " or " _reportable
event_ " has occurred within the meaning of the applicable provisions of
ERISA or the Code with respect to any Benefit Plan.

in ERISA Section 4212) to a Benefit Plan that is a " _multiemployer plan_ "
(as defined in ERISA Sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37)(A)); (iii) sponsored
or contributed to a Benefit Plan that is a " _multiple employer plan_ "
(meaning a plan sponsored by more than one employer within the meaning of

material liability, contingent or otherwise, under Title IV of ERISA with

Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not have any liability with respect to any
plan, program or arrangement that provides for post-retirement or other post-
employment medical or life insurance benefits (other than health care
continuation coverage as required by applicable Laws). The Company and each
ERISA Affiliate has complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation coverage requirements, and all other requirements, of Section
4980B of the Code and Parts 6 and 7 of Title I of ERISA, and the regulations
thereunder.

employees) without material liability (other than benefits then payable under
such plan without regard to such amendment or termination) to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary at any time. 

(e) Except as may be required by applicable Laws, or as contemplated under
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any plan
or commitment to create any additional Benefit Plans.

(f) No Benefit Plan exists that would result in the payment to any employee,
director, officer or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary of
any money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or
benefits to any such Person as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions (whether alone or in
connection with any other event). No payment or benefit which has been, will
be or may be made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect
to any current or former employee located in the United States in connection

(E) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(where applicable).

 

(h) The Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (" _ESPP_ "), was

and (iv) the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor or another

Superior Proposal from such Third Party (including interfering with the
ability of the Company to hold discussions and negotiations with such Third
Party in connection therewith) in accordance with the rights of the Company
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this  _Section 5.2(f)_
shall not prevent Parent and Merger Sub from exercising their rights under
this Agreement.

understood that taking a neutral position or no position (other than in a

recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into any agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section

foregoing _Section 5.3(a)_, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder

Directors or any committee thereof may, if the Company Board of Directors or

Proposal received after the date hereof and that does not result from a
material breach of  _Section 5.2_ or (y) any fact, event, change,
development or circumstances not known by the Company Board of Directors as of
the date hereof and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal (such fact,
event, change, development or circumstance, an



 

-37-  " _Intervening Event_ ") or (ii) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ in response to a Superior Proposal
received after the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of
a Superior Proposal, (A) no Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(b)_ may be made and (B) no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)_ may be made, in either case (1) until after
the fifth (5th) business day following Parents receipt of written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors or any
committee thereof intends to make a Company Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if
applicable, the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and an additional three (3) business day period and compliance with
this _Section 5.3(b)_ with respect to such new notice), (2) unless during
such five (5) business day period (or any additional three (3) business day
period), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, to the
extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof to proceed with making the
Company Recommendation and not make such a Company Change in Recommendation
or terminate this Agreement, and (3) unless, prior to the expiration of such
five (5) business day period (or any additional three (3) business day
period), Parent does not make a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions
of this Agreement that the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel) to be at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal;
provided further, however, that, in the case of an Intervening Event, no
Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ may be
made (A) until after the fifth (5th) business day following Parents receipt
of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors or any committee thereof intends to take such action and specifying
the facts underlying the Company Board of Directors (or any committee
thereof) determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason
for the Company Change in Recommendation, in reasonable detail, (B) unless
during such five (5) business period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent
in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for a Company Change in Recommendation, and (C) unless, by
the expiration of such five (5) business day period, the Company Board of
Directors or any committee thereof determines in good faith, taking into
consideration any amendments to this Agreement proposed by Parent (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor or another financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), that the
failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Laws.

(c) Nothing contained in  _Section 5.2_ or this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof, after 



 

-38-  consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Laws or any disclosure requirements
under applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure that
constitutes a stop, look and listen communication or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or similar communication to the Company Stockholders, shall not constitute a
Company Change in Recommendation or an approval or recommendation with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 5.4. _Notification_. The Company agrees that it will promptly inform
its and the Company Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this _Article V_.

significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such officers

prevent or restrict consummation of, or impose a materially adverse condition
upon, the Transactions.

 

(e) If necessary to obtain from any Governmental Authority any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, clearances approvals, authorizations or orders

any filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent and
the Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, to
consummate the Transactions, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated to
propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational restriction,

Section 6.7. _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurred, the Company (and following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Covered Person against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "),
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that a Covered
Person is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
Transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws. In the event of any such Action, (A) each Covered
Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Covered Person of a request therefor; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the
Company Governing Documents, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving
Corporation as authorized by the DGCL, (B) without limiting the foregoing,
each Covered Person may retain the Companys regularly engaged independent
legal counsel (provided that such engagement would not create a conflict of
interest under applicable rules of ethics) or other counsel satisfactory to
them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Covered Person as promptly as statements
therefor are received, (C) the Surviving Corporation shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or
threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Covered Person hereunder), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Covered Person from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim or such Covered Person otherwise consents,
and (D) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best
efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter. With respect to
any determination of whether a Covered Person is entitled to indemnification
by the Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation)
under this _Section 6.7_, the Covered Person shall have the right, as
contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such determination be made by
special, independent legal counsel selected by the Covered Person and approved
by the 



 

-44-  Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and who has not
otherwise performed material services for the Company or the Surviving
Corporation within the last three (3) years. For purposes of this Agreement,
each individual who is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Company
Governing Documents, the DGCL or the indemnification agreements listed in
_Section 6.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule at or at any time prior
to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be a " _Covered Person._ "

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational or
governing documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods
prior to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
Company Governing Documents and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or
similar organizational and governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, the covenants contained in this _Section 6.7_.

 

(c) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
and extend all existing officers and directors liability insurance of the
Company (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising in whole or in part
from facts or events that actually or allegedly occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of the Merger and
the adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts
containing terms no less favorable to the Covered Persons than the existing
DandO Insurance (so long as such policies are provided by the Companys current
insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower than A.M.
Best rating of A); provided, further, that if the existing DandO Insurance
expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period through no fault of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, obtain and maintain substantially similar DandO
Insurance (with such replacement policies to be provided by the Companys
current insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower than A.M.
Best rating of A); provided further, however, that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this _Section
6.7(c)_ in excess of 300% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in
2009 for such purpose (the " _Base Premium_ "), the true and correct amount
of which is set forth in _Section 6.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
and provided, further, that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable
to obtain the amount of insurance required by this  _Section 6.7(c)_ for
such aggregate premium, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for aggregate premiums not in
excess of 300% of the Base Premium. At the Companys option, it may elect to
obtain prepaid "tail" _or_ "runoff" policies prior to the Effective Time
covering a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to acts and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time;
provided that the premium therefor does not exceed 300% of the Base Premium.
In the event the Company purchases a "tail" _or_ "runoff" policy prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such tail
or runoff policy in full force and effect in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the first sentence of this _Section
6.7(c)_ for so long as any such tail or runoff policy remains in full force
and effect.



 

-45- (d) The rights of each Covered Person hereunder shall be in addition to, and
not in limitation of, any other rights such Covered Person may have under the
certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization or governing
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.
Subsequent amendment of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational or governing documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of the Surviving Corporation shall not diminish or impair the
rights of any Covered Person.

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee
of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.7_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
6.7_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger. The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_, and this _Section 6.7_
shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of
the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

 

Section 6.8. _State Takeover Laws_. If any " _control share acquisition,_ " "
_fair price_ " or other anti-takeover Laws or regulations enacted under state
or federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the
Merger or any other Transaction, then the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the
members of their respective boards of directors shall take all action
reasonably necessary and appropriate to render such statute inapplicable to
the foregoing.

 

Section 6.9. _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.9_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_;

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_; or

 



 

-46- (iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been (1)
communicated directly to the Company Stockholders generally, (2) communicated
to senior management of the Company or the Company Board of Directors and
senior management or the Company Board of Directors shall have failed to keep
such Acquisition Proposal confidential (including the fact that such
Acquisition Proposal was made, the terms thereof and the identity of the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal), or (3) otherwise publicly disclosed,
(B) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ or by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iv)_, and (C) within 180 days after the date of any such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to a
transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or any transaction
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal is consummated (provided, that for
purposes of this _Section 6.9(b)(iii)_, the references to " _25% or more_ "
in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
" _more than 50%_ " 

then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer
of same-day funds (i) in the case of the foregoing  _Section 6.9(b)(i)_,
within four (4) business days after such termination, (ii) in the case of the
foregoing _Section 6.9(b)(ii)_, concurrently with, and as a condition
precedent to, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_, and (iii) in the case of the foregoing _Section 6.9(b)(iii)_, within
two (2) business days after the earlier of (x) execution of such definitive
agreement and (y) consummation of any such Acquisition Proposal described in
Section 6.9(b)(iii)(C); it being understood that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ in order to enter into (I) prior
to the Go-Shop Period Termination Date, a definitive agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or (II) prior to the Effective Time, a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with an Excluded Party, in
either case, the Company Termination Fee shall mean a cash amount equal to
$24,100,000 (the " _Go-Shop Company Termination Fee_ "). In the event that
Parent shall receive full payment pursuant to this _Section 6.9(b)_, subject
to the proviso at the end of _Section 8.2_, the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee or the Go-Shop Company Termination Fee, as applicable, shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its affiliates for
damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section 6.9_ shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section 6.9_
and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or
more provisions hereof.

 

Section 6.10. _Section 16 of the Exchange Act_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof,



 

-47-  shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the
SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(" _Section 16_ ") of Common Stock, Company Stock Rights (or Common Stock
issued upon exercise or vesting of the same), or Restricted Stock shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

Section 6.11. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its officers or directors relating to
the Transactions.

 

Section 6.12. _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter, including to (A) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter, (B) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing, (C) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (including any " _flex_ " provisions), (D) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, and (E) enforce their rights under
the Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources of
their obligations under the Commitment Letter. In the event that all the
conditions to the Financing have been satisfied or waived, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing required to
consummate the Transactions at the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub shall
not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or the
fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment
Letter for any reason and such portion is reasonably required to fund the
Required Amounts, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall arrange to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but by no
later than seven (7) business days prior to the Outside Date, alternative
financing from alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an
amount sufficient to pay the Required Amounts. In the event that Alternative
Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.12(b)_, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with its covenants in _Section 6.12(a)_
with respect to such Alternative Financing.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to, use its
reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent and/or the Financing Sources in connection with the Financing
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), including
(i) providing information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to Parent and the Financing Sources to be used in the preparation of an
information package regarding the business, operations, financial

 



 

-48-  projections and prospects of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Financing by the Financing Sources, to the extent

offering or information documents to be used for the completion of the
Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter (as adjusted by the
agreed marketing terms, if any) or the definitive financing agreements, (ii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers for the Financing and
senior management and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, of the Company), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions
with the rating agencies, in each case as are reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Financing by the Financing Sources, (iii) assisting in
Parents preparation of documents and materials, including (A) any customary
offering documents and bank information memoranda (including public and
private versions thereof) for the Financing, and (B) materials for rating
agency presentations, in each case as are reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Financing by the Financing Sources, (iv) cooperating with
Parents marketing efforts for the Financing (including consenting to the use
of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos; provided that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably determined by
the Company), (v) provide reasonable assistance in the preparation of and
executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from their advisors), customary certificates
(including a certificate of the principal financial officer of the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to solvency of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries immediately before giving effect to the Merger in substantially
the same form as attached to the Commitment Letter), other documents and
instruments relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and customary
in connection with the Financing, (vi) provide reasonable assistance in
connection with Parents preparation of and entering into one or more credit
agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements, or other agreements;
provided that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any such agreements or amendments shall be effective until the Effective
Time, (vii) as promptly as practicable, furnishing Parent and the Financing
Sources with financial and other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing
Sources to assist in preparation of customary offering or information

the Commitment Letter or the definitive financing agreements, (viii) using
its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its independent
accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance, including
participation in due diligence sessions, (ix) using its reasonable best
efforts to permit any cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its

the distribution of information to prospective Financing Sources and
containing, if true, a representation to the Financing Sources that the public
side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public
information about the Company or its affiliates or securities, (xi) using its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Financing Sources benefit
materially from the existing lending and banking relationships of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and that the Financing Sources have the benefit of
"clear market" provisions in the



 

-49-  Commitment Letter relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (xii)
cooperating reasonably with Parents Financing Sources due diligence and with
their efforts to obtain guarantees from the Company and its Subsidiaries and
obtain and perfect security interests in the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries intended to constitute collateral securing such financing, with
such cooperation occurring prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, but
the execution of any guarantees or security arrangements not taking effect
until the Effective Time, in each case, to the extent customary and
reasonable; provided that in no event shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries be required to take any actions that would encumber any of
its assets prior to the consummation of the Merger or that would result in a
breach of any Company Material Contract or Material Company Lease prior to the
consummation of the Merger; and provided, further, until the Effective Time
occurs, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (A) be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee relating to the Financing or (B)
prior to the Effective Time have any liability or any obligation under any
credit agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document
related to the Financing (or Alternative Financing that Parent may raise in
connection with the Transactions), other than this Agreement; _provided_ ,
further, that (I) all non-public or other confidential information provided by
the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.12_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
except that Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose such
information in accordance with the Commitment Letter, and (II) the Company
shall be permitted a reasonable period to comment on those portions of
the confidential information memoranda circulated to potential financing
sources that contain or are based upon any such non-public or other
confidential information. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall not incur any liability to any Person prior to
the Effective Time in connection with any Financing (or Alternative
Financing). The effectiveness of any documentation executed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall in all cases be subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries contemplated by
this _Section 6.12(c)_ and Parent and Merger Sub shall jointly and severally
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers and Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments, and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) and any
information used in connection therewith. The foregoing indemnification
obligation shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) In the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified in accordance with  _Section 6.12(a)_, including as a
result of obtaining Alternative Financing, or if Parent substitutes
Alternative Financing for all or a portion of the Financing as permitted by
_Section 6.12(b)_, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall comply
with its covenants in this _Section 6.12_ with respect to the Commitment
Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with
respect to such Alternative Financing to the same extent that the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub would have been obligated to comply with respect to the
Financing.



 

-50- (e) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material breach
by any party to, or any condition not likely to be satisfied in, the
Commitment Letter (or any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with
this _Section 6.12_) of which Parent becomes aware or any termination (or
threat of termination) of the Commitment Letter (or commitments for
Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.12_).
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the
Financing (or Alternative Financing). In the event that the Commitment Letter
is amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this
_Section 6.12_ or Alternative Financing is obtained in accordance with this
_Section 6.12_, Parent shall promptly notify the Company thereof and promptly
provide the Company with copies of any definitive agreements related thereto.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that obtaining the Financing or
any Alternative Financing is not a condition precedent to Parents and Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement, including Parents and Merger Subs
obligations pursuant to _Article I_ and _Article II_.

 

Section 6.13. _Rights Agreement_. The Company Board of Directors shall take
all further actions (in addition to those referred to in _Section 3.26_)
reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger.

 

Section 6.14. _Cooperation Regarding Pending Investigations and Corporate
Integrity Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1 and the Effective
Time, the Company shall provide or make available to Parent, as promptly as
practicable, copies of any filings, notices, communications or
other documents sent to or received from the Investigating Entities with
respect to the Pending Investigations or to any Governmental Authority with
respect to compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall not take any action, or make any disclosure to Parent or any other
Person, that, in the opinion of Companys counsel, could jeopardize the
protection of the attorney client and work product privileges.

Section 6.15. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each employee of the
Company who is employed by the Parent or one of its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (each such person, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") receives full
credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit accrual
under any defined benefit plan) for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor service credit under its employee benefit plans)
under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as
applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes or may become a
participant; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service recognition shall
result in any duplication of benefits. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or relevant Subsidiary to, credit to
Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had
accrued under any applicable Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date. With
respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any
Continuing Employees, Parent shall 



 

-51-  (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under such plan; and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
under any similar Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing
Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs. Effective as of the Closing Date, Parent shall
assume all employment-related claims, liabilities and obligations with respect
to each of the Continuing Employees, whether known or unknown, and any other
claims, liabilities or obligations arising out of the employment of or
termination of employment of any of the Continuing Employees, in each case,
whether or not such claims, liabilities and/or obligations are related to
periods before, on or after the Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date,
the Parent and its affiliates shall retain and indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their employees and former
employees against any and all claims, liabilities and/or obligations assumed
by the Parent or its affiliates pursuant to this _Section 6.15_.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including this _Section 6.15_)
shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any Benefit Plan, (ii) provide any
Person not a party to this Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with
regard to any Benefit Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this
Agreement, or (iii) limit in any way the Surviving Corporations ability to
amend or terminate any Benefit Plan at any time, subject to applicable Laws.

 

Section 6.16. _Termination of Credit Agreement_. On or prior to the second
business day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters (subject to
delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and Merger Sub), in reasonable form,
from the administration agents under the Credit Agreement and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to make arrangements for the release of
all mortgages, liens and other security over the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries properties and assets securing such obligations (subject to
delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and Merger Sub, if necessary).

Section 9.7.  _Interpretation; Disclosure Schedules_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such
reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words " _include,_ " " _includes_ " or " _including_ " are used
in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words " _without
limitation._ " As used in this Agreement, the term " _affiliates_ " shall have
the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. All references to
this Agreement shall be deemed to include references to the " _plan of
merger_ " contained herein (as such term is used in the DGCL).

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) each Disclosure Schedule may
include certain items and information solely for informational purposes for
the convenience of the party to which such Disclosure Schedule is delivered
pursuant to this 



 

-68-  Agreement, and (ii) the disclosure by the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub on the other hand, of any matter in its Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Company
or Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material. Each
disclosure set forth in the Disclosure Schedules is identified by reference
to, or has been grouped under a heading referring to a specific section of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company or Parent and
Merger Sub disclose in any section or schedule of its Disclosure Schedule an
item or information in such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure
required by another section or schedule thereof reasonably apparent, then the
matter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in such other section or
schedule, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to
such other section or schedule.

Section 9.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile (or other electronically scanned and transmitted means) by the
parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a
counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties.

Section 9.9.  _Entire Agreement; No Reliance_.

(a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits to this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and any documents delivered by the
parties in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect thereto.

(b) Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement,
neither the Company, Parent or Merger Sub makes any other representations or
warranties and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties
made by itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Transactions, notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to any other party or any other partys Representatives
of any document or other information with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding any otherwise express representations and warranties made by
the parties in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary makes or has made any
representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues, expenses or expenditures,
future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows
(or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component
thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the future business,
operations or affairs of the Company or any Company Subsidiary heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to it, or (ii) any other information,
statements or documents heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available
to it, including the information in the electronic data room of the Company,
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the business,
operations or affairs of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except to the
extent and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made in this
Agreement.



 

-69- Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Merger is fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.11. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Except as required by the mandatory provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the law of any other state.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware
State court, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal

court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
(including the Commitment Letter) or the Transactions or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
Delaware State court or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, in
such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law. 

Section 9.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE COMMITMENT LETTER. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE



 

-70-  IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, (D) IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 9.12, _AND (E) SUCH
CERTIFICATIONS SHALL EXTEND TO THE FINANCING SOURCES.

Section 9.13.  _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors,
administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, except for (i) the provisions of
_Section 6.7_ hereof which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or
entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-
party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained
therein, (ii) subject to the proviso at the end of _Section 8.2_, for the
right of the Company, on behalf of the holders of equity interests in the
Company, to pursue damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include claims for damages based on the consideration that would have
otherwise been payable to the Company Stockholders and other relevant
matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of holders of equity
interests in the Company, in the event of a failure by Parent or Merger Sub
to consummate the Transactions, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed
by Parent and Merger Sub and (iii) _Section 9.11_, _Section 9.12_, this
_Section 9.13_ and the last sentence of  _Section 9.15_ (which, in each
case, will be for the benefit of the Persons (including the Financing Sources)
set forth therein, and any such Person will have the rights provided for
therein). The Company disclaims any and all rights as a third-party
beneficiary or otherwise under or with respect to the Commitment Letter and
any and all definitive agreements in respect of the Financing and any
Alternative Financing arranged by Parent in respect of the Transactions,
including, without limitation, any right to enforce any obligations of the
Financing Sources or to seek any damages against the Financing Sources with
respect thereto.

 

Section 9.14. _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply in
all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger, and the
other Transactions. As a material inducement to the Companys willingness to
enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Merger Sub of each
of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed
by Merger Sub under this Agreement and the Transactions, subject to all
terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby
represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such
representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such
covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub shall also be
deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company shall have the
right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available
remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly
against either or both of Parent and Merger Sub in the first instance. As
applicable, references in this _Section 9.14_ to " _Merger Sub_ " shall also
include the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.



 

-71- Section 9.15. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, except as expressly provided in the following sentence.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the
State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
without proof of actual damages, and to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject
to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), other than as limited
hereunder. The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this  _Section 9.15_, a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party
under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this _Section 9.15_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.15_ shall require any party hereto
to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 9.15_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.15_ or anything set forth in
this _Section 9.15_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Costs of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub incurred in connection with any action brought
by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub relating to the terms and provisions of
this Agreement provided for in the foregoing sentence shall be paid by the
Company in the event that Parent is successful on the merits in such action
and shall be paid by Parent in the event that the Company is successful on the
merits in such action. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the
Company or any of its controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, and shall not be obligated to any of them, or anyone claiming by
or through them, to pay consequential, special, multiple, punitive or
exemplary damages including, but not limited to, damages arising from loss of
profits, business opportunities or goodwill in respect of any breach or
failure to comply with this Agreement or in respect of any of the
Transactions (including the Financing and the Commitment Letter).
