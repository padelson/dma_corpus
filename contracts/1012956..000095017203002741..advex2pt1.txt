         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of the
2nd day of September, 2003, is by and among CAREMARK RX, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), COUGAR MERGER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub") and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and ADVANCEPCS, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), Parent and the Company will enter into a business combination
transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the "Merger");

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that
the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business
strategy of the Company and in the best interests of the Company and the holders
of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Class A Common Stock"), the holders of the Class B-1 common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Class B-1 Common Stock"),
and the holders of the Class B-2 common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Class B-2 Common Stock," and, collectively with the
Company Class A Common Stock and the Company Class B-1 Common Stock, the
"Company Common Stock"), and has approved and adopted this Agreement and
declared its advisability and approved the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) has recommended that the stockholders of
the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (i) has determined that the
Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy
of Parent and in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders and has
approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) has recommended that the stockholders of
Parent approve and adopt the Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation and
approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub (i) has determined that
the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business
strategy of Merger Sub and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its
stockholder and has approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) has recommended that
Parent approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger;

         WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has
approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger by unanimous written consent
in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL; and

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of
"reorganization";

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). The corporate existence of the Company shall continue
unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

         Section 1.2. Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable (and
in any event within two business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and by making all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as the
parties hereto agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time"). On the
date of such filing, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Standard Time, at the offices of King & Spalding LLP ("King &
Spalding"), 191 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30303, or at such other time
and location as the parties hereto shall otherwise agree.

         Section 1.3. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 1.4. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

         (a) The Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended in the Merger to read as set forth in Exhibit A,
until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or repealed in accordance
with applicable Law and such Certificate of Incorporation.

         (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be
altered, amended or repealed in accordance with applicable Law, the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

         Section 1.5. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective
Time, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of
Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE II

                 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

         Section 2.1. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

         (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1, each share of
Company Class A Common Stock, Company Class B-1 Common Stock and Company Class
B-2 Common Stock (collectively, the "Shares") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be canceled and, subject to
Section 2.2, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof be converted automatically into the right to receive (A)
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock") in an amount equal to the product of 2.15 (the "Exchange Ratio") and
0.90 (the "Stock Percentage") and (B) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share
Cash Amount, issuable and payable, without interest, upon surrender of the
certificate that formerly evidenced such Share (a "Certificate") in the manner
provided in Section 2.7 (together, the "Merger Consideration"). At the
Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.1(a). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, if either (i) the tax opinion delivered to Parent referred to in
Section 6.2(d) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by counsel to
Parent) or (ii) the tax opinion delivered to the Company referred to in Section
6.3(d) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by counsel to the Company),
in either case as a result of the Merger potentially failing to satisfy the
"acquisition of control" requirement under Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code,
the Cash Percentage shall be reduced and the Stock Percentage shall be
correspondingly increased to the minimum extent necessary to enable the
relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case may be, to be rendered.

         As used in this Agreement, the "Per Share Cash Amount" shall be equal
to ten percent (the "Cash Percentage") of the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio
and (y) the average of the per share closing sales prices of shares of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") Composite
Transactions reporting system (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, in
absence thereof, by another authoritative source) during the five consecutive
trading day period that shares of Parent Common Stock are traded on the NYSE
ending on (and including) the fifth trading day immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

         (b) Each Share held in treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.

         (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger
Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 2.2. Dissenting Shares.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are held by the Company's stockholders who have demanded and perfected
their demands for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), but shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section
262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder's Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon.

         (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company in connection with such demands and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL prior to the Effective Time. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to any such demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

         Section 2.3. Stock Options.

         (a) All stock options (the "Company Options") outstanding, whether or
not exercisable and whether or not vested, at the Effective Time under that
certain AdvancePCS Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Option Plan, dated
August 1, 1993, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated December 7, 2000, and
Amendment No. 2, dated November 1, 2001, that certain AdvancePCS Amended and
Restated 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, dated May 1, 1997, as amended by
Amendment No. 1, dated November 1, 2001 and that certain AdvancePCS 2003
Incentive Compensation Plan, effective as of August 1, 2003 (collectively, the
"Company Stock Option Plans"), shall remain outstanding following the Effective
Time notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Company Stock
Option Plans. At the Effective Time, all of the Company Options shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company
or the holder thereof, be assumed in full by Parent. Parent and the Company
agree that the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a change in control,
change of control, change in control transaction, vesting transaction or sale
of substantially all of the common stock of the Company or similar transaction
for purposes of the agreements governing any Company Options that contain
accelerated vesting provisions and the Company Stock Option Plans and that
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, all such Company Options
(other than Company Options listed in Section 2.3(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter as not accelerating prior to the consummation of the Merger) so subject
to accelerated vesting provisions shall all vest and become fully exercisable.
From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company in the Company
Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock option agreements issued thereunder
shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall have assumed the Company Stock
Option Plans as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and without
any further action by Parent. Each Company Option assumed by Parent (each, a
"Substitute Option") shall be converted automatically into options to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock upon the same terms and conditions as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Company
Option, except that (i) such Substitute Options shall remain outstanding and,
to the extent provided above, become fully vested and exercisable
notwithstanding the terms and conditions of such Company Option and Company
Stock Option Plans and (ii) (A) each such Substitute Option shall be
exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire, that whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (B) the option price per share of Parent
Common Stock under each Substitute Option shall be an amount equal to the
option price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the related Company
Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined, being rounded to
the nearest full cent). Such Substitute Option shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions as such Company Option. Section 2.3(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all Company Options as of the
date hereof, including the name of the holder of each such Company Option, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, the exercise price
thereof and whether vesting of such Company Option will be accelerated
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event).

         (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an
appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto, and
such Substitute Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (including any antidilution provisions, and subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger).
Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Substitute Options and ensure
that the conversion and assumption provided in this Section 2.3 with respect to
any Company Option that qualifies as an "incentive stock option" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. The Company has heretofore taken or
shall take all actions with respect to the Company Stock Option Plans and the
Company Options that are necessary to implement the provisions of this Section
2.3 and the other matters noted in Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Parent has heretofore taken or shall take all actions with respect to
the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Options that are necessary to
implement the provisions of this Section 2.3, including, without limitation,
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Substitute Options
pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.3. As soon as practicable,
but in no event later than five business days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall register the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Substitute Options
by filing an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
form) or another appropriate form, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements and maintain the current status of the prospectus with
respect thereto for so long as Substitute Options remain outstanding.

         (c) On or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary action such that,
with respect to each member of the Board of Directors of the Company and each
employee of the Company (including each such person who will become a director
or officer of Parent) who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the acquisition by such person of
Parent Common Stock or Substitute Options pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the disposition by any such person of
Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be exempt from the short-swing profit
liability rules of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated thereunder. Such actions shall be consistent with all current
applicable interpretation and guidance of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including, but not limited to, the No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom LLP ("Skadden Arps").

         Section 2.4. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the
AdvancePCS Employee Stock Purchase Plan, dated May 14, 2002 (the "Purchase
Plan"), the offering period in progress as of the trading date immediately
preceding the Effective Time shall be shortened by setting a new exercise date
which shall be the trading date immediately preceding the Effective Time. The
Purchase Plan shall terminate immediately following the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time.

         Section 2.5. Warrants.

         (a) At the Effective Time, the obligation to honor each outstanding
warrant to purchase Company Class A Common Stock (a "Company Warrant") shall be
deemed assumed by Parent. At and after the Effective Time: (i) each Company
Warrant then outstanding shall entitle the holder thereof to acquire the number
(rounded to the nearest whole share) of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
subject to any such Company Warrant at and after the Effective Time shall be an
amount equal to the exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio (the warrant exercise price, as so determined, being rounded to
the nearest full cent) (the "Substitute Warrants"). Other than as provided
above, as of and after the Effective Time, each Substitute Warrant shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions of the Company Warrants as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) The Company shall (i) take all corporate action and (ii) use
prompt and reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such consents, in each case,
as are necessary to cause the Company Warrants outstanding at the Effective
Time to be treated in accordance with Section 2.5(a) and be assumed by Parent
at the Effective Time. Parent shall (i) take all corporate action and (ii) use
prompt and reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such consents, in each case,
as are necessary to cause the Company Warrants outstanding at the Effective
Time to be treated in accordance with Section 2.5(a) and be assumed by Parent
at the Effective Time, including, without limitation, all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Substitute Warrants pursuant to the
terms set forth in this Section 2.5. Following the Effective Time and after
receipt of any necessary consents, no holder of a Company Warrant shall have
any rights to acquire Company Class A Common Stock.

         Section 2.6. Parent Rights Plan. References in this Agreement to
Parent Common Stock shall include the associated Parent Rights distributed to
holders of Parent Common Stock pursuant to that certain Second Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of March 11, 2002, between Parent and First
Union National Bank (the "Parent Rights Agreement").

         Section 2.7. Exchange of Certificates.

         (a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Wachovia Bank, N.A. or such other
bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company and may be
designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange
Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Article II, (ii) cash sufficient to make the cash payments
payable pursuant to this Article II and (iii) cash from time to time as
required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.7(e) (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a) out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by Section 2.7(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

         (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person
who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a): (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to
such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore:
(A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of such holder's
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, and (B) a check for the cash
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of such holder's Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate and for cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), 2.7(c) or 2.7(e). In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
such holder's Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and a check for
cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of such holder's
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, for cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7(e) and for any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c) may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.7, each
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, the
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c).

         (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

         (d) No Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid and
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant
to Section 2.7(c) or (e)) shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

         (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or script representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Each holder of Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive,
upon surrender of such holder's Certificates in accordance with this Section
2.7, an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder)
would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the average of the per share closing sales
prices of shares of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
Transactions reporting system (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or in the
absence thereof, by another authoritative source) during the five consecutive
trading days ending on (and including) the trading day immediately preceding
the date of the Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.7(b).

         (f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary
cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

         (g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
the Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look solely to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable or issuable upon due surrender of their Certificates, and any other
cash amounts payable pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of
a date which is immediately prior to such times as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

         (h) No Liability. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto
shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

         (i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Shares in respect to which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

         (j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c).

         Section 2.8. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented
to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c).

                                  ARTICLE III

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

on or before the date of this Agreement; it being understood and agreed that any
matter set forth in any Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or in the
Company SEC Reports filed on or before the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement to which such

Subsidiary. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in Section
3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or any capital stock of
any Company Subsidiary or to pay any dividend or make any other distribution in
respect thereof or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of
a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any person.

         (b) Exhibit 21.1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 includes all the subsidiaries of the Company
which as of the date of this Agreement are Significant Subsidiaries (as defined
in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) (the "Company Subsidiaries"). All
the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
such Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are, except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, owned directly or indirectly by the Company,
free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"),
other than statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and Liens set
forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and free of any other
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests), except for
restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business association or entity (other than the Company
Subsidiaries) that is or would reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         Section 3.3. Authority for Agreement.

         (a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to
obtaining necessary stockholder approval in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by the affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, voting as a single class, and the holders of
two-thirds of the outstanding Company Class B-1 Common Stock and Company Class
B-2 Common Stock, voting as a single class, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors generally and the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). The affirmative votes of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock, voting as a single class, and
the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Company Class B-1 Common Stock and
Company Class B-2 Common Stock, voting as a single class, entitled to vote at a
duly called and held meeting of the Company's stockholders are the only votes
of the holders of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve and adopt
this Agreement and the Merger.

         (b) At a meeting duly called and held on September 2, 2003, the Board
of Directors of the Company unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable
and in the best interests of the Company and the Company's stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger by the Company's stockholders. The actions taken
by the Board of Directors of the Company constitute approval of the Merger,
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Board of
Directors of the Company under the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL such
that Section 203 of the DGCL does not apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         (c) Each of Banc of America Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Company Independent Advisors") has delivered
to the Board of Directors of the Company its opinion, dated the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Company's stockholders in the Merger is
fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view. The Company will
deliver to Parent a copy of each such opinion solely for informational purposes
after receipt thereof by the Company.

         Section 3.4. No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, (a) conflict with or violate the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of
any of the Company Subsidiaries, (b) subject to Section 3.5, conflict with or
violate any United States federal, state or local or any foreign statute, law,
rule, regulation, ordinance, code, order, judgment, decree or any other
requirement or rule of law (a "Law") applicable to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (c) except as set forth in
Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter, result in a breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any payment or other obligation
pursuant to, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation or Company Material Contract to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any of them is
bound or affected, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that do not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.5. Required Filings and Consents. Except as set forth in
Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
the Company will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any United States federal, state or
local or any foreign government or any court, administrative or regulatory
agency or commission or other governmental authority or agency, domestic or
foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if
any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the

appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, (ii) for those required
by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the

permits, filings or notifications the failure of which to be made or obtained
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed on
or before the date of this Agreement, since April 1, 2000, each of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (i) has been operated at all times in compliance
in all material respects with all Laws applicable to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or by which any property, business or asset of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound or affected and (ii) is not in
default or violation of any notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures, contracts,
agreements, leases, licenses, permits, franchises, or other instruments or
obligations to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
or by which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any property or
asset of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound or affected,
other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, failures to comply,
defaults or violations that do not have and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
amending or superseding filing) any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein (or incorporated
by reference therein) or necessary in order to make the statements therein (or

they were made, not misleading. Except as set forth in Section 3.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the principal executive officer of the Company and

creditors generally and the effect of general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). Except as set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing material defaults or
breaches by the Company under any Company Material Contract (or events or
conditions which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default or breach), and there are no such material defaults (or events
or conditions which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a

their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or Joint Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent.

Statement.

         Section 3.14. Employee Benefit Plans.

         (a) Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true
and complete list of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA")) under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material
liability (sometimes referred to individually as a "Company Pension Plan" and
collectively as the "Company Pension Plans"), all "employee welfare benefit
plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) under which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has any material liability (sometimes referred to
individually as a "Company Welfare Plan" and collectively as the "Company
Welfare Plans"), and all vacation, severance, termination, change in control,
employment, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock option, fringe
benefit, stock purchase, stock ownership, phantom stock, deferred compensation
plans or agreements and other employee fringe benefit plans or arrangements
maintained, contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed to by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any present or former
officers, employees, directors or independent contractors of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
any actual or contingent material liabilities (each of the foregoing being
referred to with the Company Pension Plans and the Company Welfare Plans,
individually as a "Company Benefit Plan" and collectively as the "Company
Benefit Plans").

         (b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies
of (i) each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company
Benefit Plan, a summary of the material provisions of such plan), (ii) the
three most recent annual reports on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to each Company Benefit Plan to the extent any such report
was required by applicable Law, (iii) the most recent summary plan description
for each Company Benefit Plan for which such a summary plan description is
required by applicable Law and (iv) each currently effective trust agreement
and insurance or annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan.

         (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in
Section 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter:

                  (i) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in
         accordance with its terms, and the Company and each of the Company
         Subsidiaries and all of the Company Benefit Plans are in compliance
         with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable
         Laws as to the Company Benefit Plans. The fair market value of the
         assets of each of the Company Pension Plans as of the most recent
         annual valuation date for such plan equaled or exceeded on a
         termination basis the then present value of the liabilities of such
         plan, and all contributions required under each Company Benefit Plan
         have been made in full on a timely and proper basis.

                  (ii) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, individually
         and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of
         the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances,
         including claims, audits and investigations, in connection with which
         the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries could be subject to any
         liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, except
         for making contributions, or the payment of claims or the payment of
         PBGC premiums in the ordinary course of the operation of any such
         Company Benefit Plans.

                  (iii) Each Company Pension Plan that is intended to comply
         with the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code has been amended to
         satisfy all the currently applicable requirements for such a plan, and
         each such plan is the subject of a determination letter from the
         Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Pension Plan
         as so amended satisfies all such requirements (other than the
         requirements of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
         of 2001) and is qualified and exempt from income taxes under Sections
         401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such
         determination letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge of the
         Company, revocation has not been threatened. The Company has made
         available to Parent a copy of each such favorable determination
         letter. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has maintained,
         contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has
         any actual or contingent liability under, any benefit plan that is
         subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is
         otherwise a defined benefit pension plan (as defined in Section 3(35)
         of ERISA).

                  (iv) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no oral
         understandings, agreements or undertakings binding on the Company with
         any person that would (pursuant to any such understandings, agreements
         or undertakings) result in any material liabilities if any Company
         Benefit Plan was amended or terminated on or at any time after the
         Effective Time or that would prevent any unilateral action by the
         Company (or, after the Effective Time, Parent) to effect such
         amendment or termination.

                  (v) No Company Welfare Plan provides benefits to, or on
         behalf of, any former employee after the termination of employment
         except (A) where the full cost of such benefit is borne entirely by
         the former employee (or his eligible dependents or beneficiaries), (B)
         where plan benefits are payable through a trust, the fair market value
         of the assets of which equal or exceed the present value of the
         liabilities of such plan or (C) where the benefit is required by
         Section 4980B of the Code.

                  (vi) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
         nor the consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
         (alone or in conjunction with a termination of employment) will (A)
         trigger any funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any
         compensation or benefits or (B) result in any violation or breach of,
         or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under
         any Company Benefit Plan.

                  (vii) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
         given notice to any participant, beneficiary, fiduciary or
         administrator of any Company Benefit Plan or to any government or
         agency of a government to the effect that the Company or such Company
         Subsidiary intends to terminate or withdraw from such plan.

                  (viii) Each individual who is classified by the Company or
         any of the Company Subsidiaries as an "employee" or as an "independent
         contractor" is properly so classified.

         Section 3.15. Labor and Employment Matters. Except as set forth in
Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter:

         (a) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is or has

regarding, any collective bargaining agreement or other contracts,
arrangements, agreements or understandings with a labor union or labor
organization that was certified by the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB")
or voluntarily recognized or recognized under Law. There is no existing,
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, (i) walkout, lockout,
strike, slowdown, hand billing, picketing, work stoppage (sympathetic or
otherwise), work interruption or other "concerted action" (each, a "Concerted
Action") involving the employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company
and its subsidiaries as a whole, (ii) unfair labor practice charge or
complaint, labor dispute, labor arbitration proceeding or any other matter

(iii) election petition or proceeding by a labor union or representative
thereof to organize any employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (iv) certification or decertification question relating to
collective bargaining units at the premises of the Company or any of the

or any of the Company Subsidiaries whether or not filed pursuant to a

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the employees of the Company nor the
employees of any of the Company Subsidiaries have engaged in a material
Concerted Action in the past three years.

         (b) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees
has committed an unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the
respective businesses of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are
in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, workers'
compensation, occupational safety, plant closings, mass layoffs and wages and
hours, except where such failure would not reasonably be expected to have,

time-off.

the knowledge of the Company, from any citizens' group, employee or otherwise,
that alleges that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is not in such
compliance.

         (b) There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or, to
the knowledge of the Company, against any person or entity whose liability for

in any Section of the Parent Disclosure Letter or in the Parent SEC Reports
filed on or before the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure
for all purposes of this Agreement to which such matter could reasonably be

or authorized by Merger Sub relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of
Merger Sub or obligating Merger Sub to issue or sell any shares of capital

         (c) Exhibit 21 to Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2002 includes all the subsidiaries of Parent which as
of the date of this Agreement are Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule

outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
Parent Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully

interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws.
Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of

directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than
the Parent Subsidiaries) that is or would reasonably be expected to be material

         Section 4.3. Authority for Agreement.

         (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and, subject to obtaining necessary stockholder approval in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock to approve and
adopt the Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation in accordance with the
DGCL, the approval by a majority of votes cast by the holders of Parent Common
Stock, provided that the total votes cast represents over 50% in interest of
all securities entitled to vote, as required by the Listed Company Manual of
the NYSE, of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger
and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by
the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to
or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and the effect of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock entitled
to vote at a duly called and held meeting of Parent's stockholders as required
by the DGCL is the only vote of the holders of any capital stock of Parent
necessary to approve and adopt the Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation
and approval by a majority of votes cast by the holders of Parent Common Stock,
provided that the total votes cast represents over 50% in interest of all
securities entitled to vote, as required by the Listed Company Manual of the
NYSE, is the only vote of the holders of any capital stock of Parent necessary
to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub entitled to vote at a duly called and held meeting
of the stockholders as required by the DGCL is the only vote of the holders of
any capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger.

         (b) At a meeting duly called and held on September 2, 2003, the Board
of Directors of Parent unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and
in the best interests of Parent and Parent's stockholders, (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, (iii) approved and adopted the Amended Parent Certificate of
Incorporation and (iv) resolved to recommend approval and adoption of the
Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation and the approval of the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger by Parent's stockholders. The
actions taken by the Board of Directors of Parent constitute approval of the
Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the
Board of Directors of Parent under the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL
such that Section 203 of the DGCL does not apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         (c) At a meeting duly called and held on September 2, 2003, the Board

the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable
and in the best interests of Merger Sub and Merger Sub's stockholder, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholder of Merger Sub.

         (d) Each of UBS Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (the
"Parent Independent Advisors") has delivered to the Board of Directors of
Parent its opinion, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of
such date and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations contained therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to Parent. Parent will deliver to the Company a copy
of each such opinion solely for informational purposes after receipt thereof by
Parent.

         Section 4.4. No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (a) conflict with
or violate the Parent Certificate of Incorporation or Parent Bylaws, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub or Bylaws of Merger Sub, or the
equivalent organizational documents of any of the Parent Subsidiaries, (b)
subject to Section 4.5, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (c) except as set
forth in Section 4.4 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, result in a breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any payment or other obligation
pursuant to, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation or Parent Material Contract to which Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected,

Entity, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws and filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, (ii) for
those required by the HSR Act and (iii) for such other consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits, filings or notifications the failure of which to be
made or obtained would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.6. Compliance. Except as set forth in Section 4.6 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed on or
before the date of this Agreement, since January 1, 2000, each of Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries (i) has been operated at all times in compliance in all
material respects with all Laws applicable to Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries or by which any property, business or asset of Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries is bound or affected and (ii) is not in default or
violation of any notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures, contracts, agreements,
leases, licenses, permits, franchises or other instruments or obligations to

Parent Subsidiaries is bound or affected, other than, in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii) above, failures to comply, defaults or violations that do not have

in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date
so filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and in the
case of any Parent SEC Reports amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding
filing). Except as set forth in Section 4.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
none of the Parent SEC Reports (including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein) contained when filed (and, in
the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and in the case of any
Parent SEC Reports amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding filing) any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein (or incorporated by reference therein) or necessary in order to

involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject,

         accordance with its terms, and Parent and each of the Parent
         Subsidiaries and all of the Parent Benefit Plans are in compliance
         with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable
         Laws as to the Parent Benefit Plans. The fair market value of the
         assets of each of the Parent Pension Plans as of the most recent
         annual valuation date for such plan equaled or exceeded on a
         termination basis the then present value of the liabilities of such
         plan, and all contributions required under each Parent Benefit Plan
         have been made in full on a timely and proper basis.

                  (ii) With respect to the Parent Benefit Plans, individually
         and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of
         Parent, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, including
         claims, audits and investigations, in connection with which Parent or
         any of the Parent Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability under
         ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, except for making
         contributions, or the payment of claims or the payment of PBGC
         premiums in the ordinary course of the operation of any such Parent
         Benefit Plans.

                  (iii) Each Parent Pension Plan that is intended to comply
         with the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code has been amended to
         satisfy all the currently applicable requirements for such a plan, and
         each such plan is the subject of a determination letter from the
         Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Parent Pension Plan
         as so amended satisfies all such requirements (other than the
         requirements of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
         of 2001) and is qualified and exempt from income taxes under Sections
         401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such
         determination letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge of Parent,
         revocation has not been threatened. Parent has made available to the
         Company a copy of each such favorable determination letter. Neither
         Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has maintained, contributed to or
         been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has any actual or
         contingent liability under, any benefit plan that is subject to Title
         IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined
         benefit pension plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA).

                  (iv) To the knowledge of Parent, there are no oral
         understandings, agreements or undertakings binding on Parent with any
         person that would (pursuant to any such understandings, agreements or
         undertakings) result in any material liabilities if any Parent Benefit
         Plan was amended or terminated on or at any time after the Effective
         Time or that would prevent any unilateral action by Parent to effect
         such amendment or termination.

                  (v) No Parent Welfare Plan provides benefits to, or on behalf
         of, any former employee after the termination of employment except (A)
         where the full cost of such benefit is borne entirely by the former
         employee (or his eligible dependents or beneficiaries), (B) where plan
         benefits are payable through a trust, the fair market value of the
         assets of which equal or exceed the present value of the liabilities
         of such plan or (C) where the benefit is required by Section 4980B of
         the Code.

                  (vi) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
         nor the consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
         (alone or in conjunction with a termination of employment) will (A)
         trigger any funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any
         compensation or benefits or (B) result in any violation or breach of,
         or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under
         any Parent Benefit Plan.

                  (vii) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has given
         notice to any participant, beneficiary, fiduciary or administrator of
         any Parent Benefit Plan or to any government or agency of a government
         to the effect that Parent or such Parent Subsidiary intends to
         terminate or withdraw from such plan.

                  (viii) Each individual who is classified by Parent or any of
         the Parent Subsidiaries as an "employee" or as an "independent
         contractor" is properly so classified.

         Section 4.15. Labor and Employment Matters. Except as set forth in
Section 4.15 of the Parent Disclosure Letter:

         (a) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is or has been,
since January 1, 2000, a party to, or bound by, or conducted negotiations
regarding, any collective bargaining agreement or other contracts,
arrangements, agreements or understandings with a labor union or labor
organization that was certified by the NLRB or voluntarily recognized or
recognized under Law. There is no existing, pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened, (i) Concerted Action involving the employees of Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to be
material to Parent and its subsidiaries as a whole, (ii) unfair labor practice
charge or complaint, labor dispute, labor arbitration proceeding or any other
matter before the NLRB or any other comparable state agency against or
involving Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (iii) election petition or other activity or proceeding by a labor
union or representative thereof to organize any employees of Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, (iv) certification or decertification question
relating to collective bargaining units at the premises of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or (v) grievance or arbitration demand against Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries whether or not filed pursuant to a collective
bargaining agreement which would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
Parent, neither the employees of Parent nor the employees of any of the Parent
Subsidiaries have engaged in a material Concerted Action in the past three
years.

         (b) To the knowledge of Parent, none of Parent, any of the Parent
Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees has
committed an unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the
respective businesses of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance
with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment, workers' compensation,
occupational safety, plant closings, mass layoffs and wages and hours, except
where such failure would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have properly accrued on their books and records all material
unpaid but accrued wages, salaries and other paid time-off.

         Section 4.16. Environmental Compliance and Disclosure. Except as set
forth in Section 4.16 of the Parent Disclosure Letter:

         (a) Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all applicable Environmental Laws (which compliance includes, but is not
limited to, possession by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries of all permits,
licenses and governmental authorizations required under applicable
Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and conditions thereof),
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2000, neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any written or, to the knowledge
of Parent, oral communication from a Governmental Entity, or, to the knowledge
of Parent, from any citizens' group, employee or otherwise, that alleges that
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is not in such compliance.

         (b) There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or, to the
knowledge of Parent, against any person or entity whose liability for any
Environmental Claim Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has retained or assumed
either contractually or by operation of law.

         (c) To Parent's knowledge, none of the assets owned by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or any real property owned or leased by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary contain any friable asbestos, PCBs or underground storage tanks
which are reasonably likely to result in a material liability to Parent.

         Section 4.17. Intellectual Property.

         (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has such ownership or right to use the
Parent Intellectual Property Rights as is necessary to the conduct of the
business of each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as presently conducted,
except where the failure to have such ownership or right of use would not have
a material adverse effect on Parent's or any Parent Subsidiary's ability to
conduct its business as presently conducted. The validity of the Parent
Intellectual Property Rights owned by Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the validity of the Parent Intellectual Property Rights used but not owned by
Parent: (i) have not been challenged in any prior Litigation, except for such
challenges that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect if determined adversely to
Parent; (ii) as of the date of this Agreement, are not being challenged in any
material pending Litigation; and (iii) as of the date of this Agreement, are
not the subject(s) of any material Litigation threatened in writing. To the
knowledge of Parent, the business of each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
as presently conducted does not conflict in any material respects with and has
not been alleged to conflict in any material respects with any Intellectual
Property Rights of others. Except as set forth in Sections 4.4 and 4.17(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the Merger or other
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the material loss or
impairment of any of the Parent Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge
of Parent, there are no third parties infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating the Parent Intellectual Property Rights owned by Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries, except for such infringements, misappropriations or other
violations as would not have a material adverse effect on Parent's or any
Parent Subsidiary's ability to conduct its business as presently conducted.

         (b) The validity of the Parent Intellectual Property Rights owned by
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the validity of the Parent Intellectual
Property Rights used but not owned by Parent (i) are not being challenged in
any pending Litigation and (ii) are not the subject(s) of any Litigation
threatened in writing, except for such challenges, threats or Litigation
described above under clauses (i) and (ii) that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect if determined adversely to Parent.

         (c) As used in this Agreement, the term "Parent Intellectual Property
Rights" means the Intellectual Property Rights owned by Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary or used in the conduct of the business of Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary as currently conducted.

         Section 4.18. Brokers. Except for the Parent Independent Advisors, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent. Parent has made available to the
Company a complete and correct copy of each of the agreements between Parent
and the Parent Independent Advisors pursuant to which such firm would be
entitled to any payment relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 4.19. Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in
Section 4.19 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports filed on or before the date of this Agreement, solely as a result of a
person's ownership of Parent Common Stock or for customary compensation and
benefits received in the ordinary course of business as an employee or director
of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, no director, officer or other "affiliate"
or "associate" of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any entity in which, to
the knowledge of Parent, any such director, officer or other affiliate or
associate owns any beneficial interest (other than a publicly held corporation
whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter market and less than 1% of the stock of which is beneficially
owned by any such persons): (i) receives any material benefit from any
contract, arrangement or understanding with or relating to the business or
operations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary; (ii) is a party to or receives
any material benefit from any loan, arrangement, understanding, agreement or
contract for or relating to indebtedness of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary; or

or operations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

necessary for the conduct of their business and the use of their properties and
assets, as presently conducted and used, and neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has received written notice from any Governmental Entity that any
such Permit is subject to any adverse action, except where the failure to have
any such Permit or the receipt of such notice would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary are in compliance with (i) to
the extent applicable, all rules and regulations of the Medicare and Medicaid

all federal laws, rules, regulations and applicable guidance relating to health

state, federal or other governmental health care or health insurance program or
any private payor, except where any failure to be in compliance with any of the
foregoing matters described above in clauses (i) through (vi) would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, unless the
Company shall otherwise consent in writing, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, Parent shall not, nor shall Parent permit any of the
Parent Subsidiaries to: (i) subject to Section 5.2(d), amend its certificate of
incorporation (including any certificate of designations attached thereto) or
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents; (ii) create, assume or
incur any material amount of indebtedness for borrowed money or guaranty any
such indebtedness of another person, other than (A) borrowings under existing
lines of credit (or under any refinancing or amendment of such existing lines)
or (B) indebtedness owing to, or guaranties of indebtedness owing to, Parent;
(iii) other than in the ordinary course of business, make any material loans or
advances to any other person other than loans or advances between any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or between Parent and any of the Parent Subsidiaries; (iv)
mortgage or pledge any of its material assets or properties; (v) merge or
consolidate with any other entity or make any acquisition which in each case
would be material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or
sell any material business or assets (other than sales of products and
inventory in the ordinary course of business); (vi) change its accounting
policies except as required by GAAP; (vii) except in the ordinary course of
business, materially amend or cancel or agree to any material amendment or
cancellation of any Parent Material Contract; (viii) form or commence the
operations of any business or any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
business association or other business organization or division thereof which
would be material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as a whole (other than
in the ordinary course of business) or (ix) sell, transfer or lease, or agree
to sell, transfer or lease, any material properties or assets (real, personal
or mixed, tangible or intangible) to any of its officers or directors or any
"affiliate" or "associate" of any of its officers or directors.

         (d) Subject to receipt of the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as required by the
DGCL, Parent covenants and agrees that it shall, on or before the Effective
Time, amend and file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an
amendment to the Parent Certificate of Incorporation which shall increase the
authorized number of shares of Parent Common Stock from 400,000,000 shares to
700,000,000 shares (the "Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation").

         (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent's operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

         Section 5.3. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

         (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the officers, directors, employees, auditors,
attorneys, consultants, financial advisors, lenders and other representatives
(collectively, the "Representatives") of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford the Representatives of Parent and Merger Sub, upon
reasonable advance notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to
the officers, employees, agents, premises, properties, offices and other
facilities, books, records, contracts and documents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with all
financial, tax, operating and other data and information as Parent or Merger
Sub, through its Representatives, may reasonably request. Parent and Merger Sub
shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the business of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for
access, data and other information hereunder. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to furnish to Parent quarterly financial and operating data and
information in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C within
forty-five days following the end of each calendar quarter. In addition, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent within thirty
days following the end of each calendar month a schedule in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D identifying the aggregate estimated
annualized revenue and earnings associated with (a) all new business secured
during the preceding calendar month, (b) all business that has been lost or is
not being renewed during the preceding calendar month and (c) all business that
has been renewed on new or revised terms or conditions (including a comparison
to the annualized revenue and earnings associated with the previous contract)
(such changes in (a), (b) and (c), the "Company Changed Contracts"). Parent
will remain subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with the
Company dated May 7, 2003 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to provide any such access
or data and information if the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that providing such access or data and
information would violate any legal or contractual restrictions, including
restrictions under Antitrust Laws. Neither Parent nor any of its
Representatives shall contact any person who, to the knowledge of Parent, is a
client or customer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries without
the Company's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, Parent and its Representatives shall
not be restricted from contacting any potential clients or customers in the
ordinary course of business, including in connection with responding to
"requests for proposals."

         (b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Representatives of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
to, afford the Representatives of the Company, upon reasonable advance notice,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers, employees,
agents, premises, properties, offices and other facilities, books, records,
contracts and documents of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, and shall
furnish the Company with all financial, tax, operating and other data and
information as the Company, through its Representatives, may reasonably
request. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize any
disruption to the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that may
result from the requests for access, data and other information hereunder.
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Company quarterly
financial and operating data and information in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E within forty-five days following the end of each calendar
quarter. In addition, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to
the Company within thirty days following the end of each calendar month a
schedule in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D identifying the
aggregate estimated annualized revenue and earnings associated with (a) all new
business secured during the preceding calendar month, (b) all business that has
been lost or is not being renewed during the preceding calendar month and (c)
all business that has been renewed on new or revised terms or conditions
(including a comparison to the annualized revenue and earnings associated with
the previous contract) (such changes in (a), (b) and (c), the "Parent Changed
Contracts"). The Company will remain subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have no
obligation to provide any such access or data and information if Parent
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
providing such access or data and information would violate any legal or
contractual restrictions, including restrictions under Antitrust Laws. Neither
the Company nor any of its Representatives shall contact any person, who to the
knowledge of the Company, is a client or customer of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries without Parent's prior written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, the Company or its
Representatives shall not be restricted from contacting any potential clients
or customers in the ordinary course of business, including in connection with
responding to "requests for proposals."

         (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the parties (and each employee,
representative or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and any facts that
may be relevant to the Tax structure of the Merger; provided, however, that no
party (and no employee, representative or other agent thereof) shall disclose
any other information that is not relevant to understanding the Tax treatment
and Tax structure of the Merger (including the identity of any party and any
information that could lead another to determine the identity of any party), or
any other information to the extent that such disclosure could reasonably
result in a violation of any federal or state securities law. The parties
acknowledge and agree that this Section 5.3(d) shall be deemed an amendment to
the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with paragraph 11
thereof.

         Section 5.4. Notification of Certain Matters.

         (a) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company will
confer in good faith on a regular basis with one or more representatives of
Parent designated to the Company regarding satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges
that Parent does not and will not waive any rights it may have under this
Agreement as a result of such consultations.

         (b) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent will confer
in good faith on a regular basis with one or more representatives of the
Company designated to Parent regarding satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges that the
Company does not and will not waive any rights it may have under this Agreement
as a result of such consultations.

         (c) If any event or matter arises after the date of this Agreement
which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, (i) would have
been required to be set forth or described by the Company in the Company
Disclosure Letter or by Parent in the Parent Disclosure Letter or (ii) would
have caused a representation or warranty in Article III or Article IV hereof,
as applicable, to be violated as of such date, then the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall, for informational purposes only, deliver to Parent or the
Company, as applicable, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, updated to reflect such event or matter on or before the
first business day following the 45th day after the end of each fiscal quarter
prior to the Effective Time and at the Effective Time (the last such delivery
being made as of the Effective Time); provided, however, that such supplemental
disclosure shall not be required to disclose any such event or matter, and the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall
not be required to be updated, in either case, with respect to representations
or warranties that are expressly made as of a specific date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any event or matter arises after the date of this Agreement
that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall promptly after becoming aware of such event or matter
communicate the occurrence of such event or matter to Parent or the Company, as
applicable, and in any event shall communicate such event or matter to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, in writing within ten days of such party's
first becoming aware of such event or matter. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to furnish to Parent within thirty days following the end of each
calendar month notification of any pending or threatened bankruptcy or similar
proceeding known to the Company involving any party to any Company Material
Contract. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Company
within thirty days following the end of each calendar month notification of any
pending or threatened bankruptcy or similar proceeding known to Parent
involving any party to any Parent Material Contract. Failure to comply with
this Section 5.4(c) shall not result in a failure by the Company to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(b) or 6.2(c) unless the event or matter
giving rise to the obligation to amend or supplement hereunder involves a
breach of a representation or warranty hereunder which results in a failure to
satisfy the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) and which breach is incurable
or has not been cured in all material respects as contemplated by Section
7.1(i). Failure to comply with this Section 5.4(c) shall not result in a
failure by Parent to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 6.3(b) or
6.3(c) unless the event or matter giving rise to the obligation to amend or
supplement hereunder involves a breach of a representation or warranty
hereunder which results in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in
Section 6.3(a) and which breach is incurable or has not been cured in all
material respects as contemplated by Section 7.1(j). Except as set forth in the
two preceding sentences, the parties' obligations under this Section 5.4(c) and
the disclosure of any matter in accordance with the provisions of this Section
5.4(c) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such disclosure and shall not be deemed to cure any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement.

         Section 5.5. HSR Filings; Best Efforts; Further Assurances.

         (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) make or cause to be made
the filings required of such party to this Agreement or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, the Parent Subsidiaries or affiliates under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act for additional information,
documents or other materials received by such party to this Agreement or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries from the United States
Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or such transactions, and
(iii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in
connection with any such filing (including, if requested by the other party, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other
party in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity
under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, each party to
this Agreement shall use all reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Laws in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement shall
give the other parties to this Agreement reasonable prior notice of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement
with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. None of the parties to this Agreement shall independently
participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other parties to this Agreement prior notice of the
meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend or participate. The parties to this Agreement will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws. Parent shall take the lead in coordinating any filings and obtaining any
necessary approvals under the HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign
antitrust laws, including the timing of the initial filing, which will be made
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

         (b) Subject to Section 5.5(d), each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act of
1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith and subject to
Section 5.5(d), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as inconsistent with or violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall (by negotiation, litigation
or otherwise) cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts vigorously to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any administrative
or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal, unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the
Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing
in this Section 5.5 shall limit the right of a party to this Agreement to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c), so long as such party to
this Agreement has up to then complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 5.5. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement.

         (c) Subject to Section 5.5(d), each of the parties to this Agreement
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all other necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties related to or required in connection with the Merger that are necessary
to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement, (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and (v) the providing of all
such information concerning such party, its subsidiaries, its affiliates and
its subsidiaries' and affiliates' officers, directors, employees and partners
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth
in Section 5.5(a), Section 5.5(b) or this Section 5.5(c). Each of Parent and
the Company agrees that it will use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain
prior to the Effective Time each of the consents that are listed in Section
5.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any
objections asserted under Antitrust Laws by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to divest any of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or take or agree to take any other action
or agree to any limitation or restriction, that the Board of Directors of
Parent reasonably determines in good faith, after considering the advice of its
management and legal and financial advisors, (i) to be materially adverse to
Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) would materially impair
the overall benefits expected, as of the date hereof, to be realized from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (e) Except as set forth in Section 5.5(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter or Section 5.5(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, in
each case on the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to
acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose
any delay (other than an immaterial delay) in the obtaining of, or increase the
risk (other than an insignificant increase) of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
increase the risk (other than an insignificant increase) of any Governmental
Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) increase the risk (other than an
insignificant increase) of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise or (iv) delay (other than an immaterial delay) or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 5.6. No Solicitation.

         (a) Company.

                  (i) The Company shall not, and shall not authorize and will
         use its reasonable best efforts not to, permit any of the Company
         Subsidiaries or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A)
         solicit, initiate or encourage, or knowingly take any other action to
         facilitate, the submission of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
         the Company or (B) participate in or encourage any discussions or
         negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
         information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
         any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may
         reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with
         respect to the Company; provided, however, that, prior to obtaining
         approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger from the
         stockholders of the Company, the foregoing shall not prohibit the
         Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their Representatives from
         furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
         negotiations with, any person that makes an Acquisition Proposal with
         respect to the Company that was not solicited by the Company in breach
         of this Section 5.6(a) or that did not otherwise result from a breach
         of this Section 5.6(a), if, and to the extent that, (x) the Board of
         Directors of the Company, after consultation with and having
         considered the advice of outside legal counsel, determines in good
         faith that failure to take such action could result in a reasonable
         probability that the Board of Directors of the Company would breach
         its fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware law, (y) prior to
         furnishing any such information to such person, the Company receives
         from such person an executed agreement in reasonably customary form
         relating to the confidentiality of information to be provided to such
         person (provided that if the Company enters into such a
         confidentiality agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
         that contains provisions that are less protective in any material
         respects to the Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality
         Agreement, the Company agrees to amend the Confidentiality Agreement
         so as to provide Parent the benefit of such less protective
         provisions), and (z) the Board of Directors of the Company determines
         in good faith, after having considered the advice from its independent
         financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably
         likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Unless the Board of Directors
         of the Company, after consultation with and having considered the
         advice of outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that taking
         such action could result in a reasonable probability that the Board of
         Directors of the Company would breach its fiduciary duties under
         applicable Delaware law, the Company shall (i) provide prompt (but in
         no event less than twenty-four hours after receipt of any Acquisition
         Proposal with respect to the Company) written notice to Parent of the
         receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal, indicating in connection
         with such notice the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
         Proposal, the identity of such person making any such Acquisition
         Proposal and the Company's current intention with respect to
         furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
         negotiations with, such person and (ii) promptly keep Parent informed
         of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. All
         information provided by the Company to Parent under this Section
         5.6(a)(i) shall be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the
         terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
         or anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the
         contrary, Parent (and each Representative of Parent) may disclose to
         any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment
         and any facts that may be relevant to the Tax structure of an
         Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company beginning on the
         earliest of (i) the date of the public announcement of discussions
         relating to such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the date of public
         announcement of such Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) the date of the
         execution of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into
         such Acquisition Proposal, provided, however, that neither Parent nor
         any Representative of Parent may disclose any other information that
         is not relevant to understanding the Tax treatment and Tax structure
         of such Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of any party and
         any information that could lead another to determine the identity of
         any party), or any other information to the extent that such
         disclosure could reasonably result in a violation of any federal or
         state securities laws. The Company shall cease and cause to be
         terminated immediately all existing discussions or negotiations with
         any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
         Proposal with respect to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement,
         "Acquisition Proposal" means, other than the transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement, any bona fide offer or proposal with respect to (i)
         a merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization,
         recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
         involving the Company or Parent, as applicable, (ii) any purchase or
         other acquisition of 10% or more of the consolidated assets of the
         Company or Parent, as applicable, or (iii) any purchase or other
         acquisition (by tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise) of 10% or
         more of the outstanding voting equity securities of the Company or
         Parent, as applicable.

                  (ii) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not, except
         as expressly permitted by this Agreement (including this Section
         5.6(a)(ii)), (A) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
         withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
         Sub, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to
         the Company's stockholders to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
         Merger (a "Company Change in Recommendation"), (B) approve or
         recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
         transaction involving an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
         Company from a third party (a "Company Alternative Transaction"), or
         (C) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
         principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (other
         than a confidentiality agreement) (each, an "Acquisition Agreement")
         related to any Company Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, if prior to the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
         the Merger by the Company's stockholders, the Board of Directors of
         the Company determines in good faith, after it has received a Superior
         Proposal in compliance with Section 5.6(a)(i) and after consultation
         with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel, that
         failure to take such action could result in a reasonable probability
         that the Board of Directors of the Company would breach its fiduciary
         duties under applicable Delaware law, the Board of Directors of the
         Company may (subject to this and the following sentences in this
         Section 5.6(a)(ii)) (1) make a Company Change in Recommendation, (2)
         approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
         such Superior Proposal (either clause (1) or (2) above being a
         "Company Subsequent Determination") and (3) authorize the Company to
         and cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
         respect to a Superior Proposal, but in each case only at a time that
         is after the fifth day (or the second day, in the case of a material
         amendment to a Superior Proposal) following Parent's receipt of
         written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
         Company is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal. Such written notice
         shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior
         Proposal (and include a copy thereof with all accompanying
         documentation, if in writing), identify the person making such
         Superior Proposal and state that the Board of Directors of the Company
         intends to make a Company Subsequent Determination or authorize the
         Company to and cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition
         Agreement. During such five day period (or two day period in the case
         of a material amendment), the Company shall provide an opportunity for
         Parent to propose such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
         Agreement as would enable the Board of Directors of the Company to
         proceed with its recommendation to the Company's stockholders without
         a Company Subsequent Determination. For purposes of this Agreement, a
         "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal (on its
         most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made
         by a third party to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction or a
         Parent Alternative Transaction, as applicable, which the Board of
         Directors of the Company or Parent, as applicable, determines in its
         good faith judgment (having considered, among other things, the advice
         of outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor) to be
         more favorable to the Company's stockholders or Parent's stockholders,
         as applicable, than the Merger (taking into account such matters as
         deemed relevant by such Board of Directors, including (i) whether, in
         the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company or
         Parent, as applicable, the third party is reasonably able to finance
         the transaction, (ii) any proposed changes to this Agreement that may
         be proposed by Parent or the Company, as applicable, in response to
         such Alternative Transaction and (iii) the ability and timing for
         satisfaction of the conditions to closing the Merger and such
         Alternative Transaction).

                  (iii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
         Company from (A) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
         contemplated by Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
         Exchange Act or (B) making any disclosure to the Company's
         stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
         of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure
         so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided,
         however, that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the
         Company shall, except as specifically permitted by Section 5.6(a)(ii),
         make a Company Change in Recommendation or approve or recommend, or
         propose publicly to approve or recommend, a Company Alternative
         Transaction.

         (b) Parent.

                  (i) Parent shall not, and shall not authorize and will use
         its reasonable best efforts not to, permit any of the Parent
         Subsidiaries or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A)
         solicit, initiate or encourage, or knowingly take any other action to
         facilitate, the submission of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
         Parent or (B) participate in or encourage any discussion or
         negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
         information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
         any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may
         reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with
         respect to Parent; provided, however, that, prior to obtaining
         approval and adoption of the Amended Parent Certificate of
         Incorporation and the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock
         in connection with the Merger from the stockholders of Parent, the
         foregoing shall not prohibit Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or their
         Representative from furnishing information to, or entering into
         discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an Acquisition
         Proposal with respect to Parent that was not solicited by Parent in
         breach of this Section 5.6(b) or that did not otherwise result from a
         breach of this Section 5.6(b), if, and to the extent that, (x) the
         Board of Directors of Parent, after consultation with and having
         considered the advice of outside legal counsel, determines in good
         faith that failure to take such action could result in a reasonable
         probability that the Board of Directors of Parent would breach its
         fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware law, (y) prior to
         furnishing any such information to such person, Parent receives from
         such person an executed agreement in reasonably customary form
         relating to the confidentiality of information to be provided to such
         person (provided that if Parent enters into such a confidentiality
         agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal that contains
         provisions that are less protective in any material respects to Parent
         than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent agrees to
         amend the Confidentiality Agreement so as to provide the Company the
         benefit of such less protective provisions), and (z) the Board of
         Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after having considered
         the advice from its independent financial advisor, that such
         Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably likely to result in a
         Superior Proposal. Unless the Board of Directors of Parent, after
         consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal
         counsel, determines in good faith that taking such action could result
         in a reasonable probability that the Board of Directors of Parent
         would breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware law,
         Parent shall (i) provide prompt (but in no event less than twenty-four
         hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
         Parent) written notice to the Company of the receipt of any such
         Acquisition Proposal, indicating in connection with such notice the
         material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, the
         identity of such person making any such Acquisition Proposal and
         Parent's current intention with respect to furnishing information to,
         or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person and
         (ii) promptly keep the Company informed of the status and material
         terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. All information provided by
         Parent to the Company under this Section 5.6(b)(i) shall be kept
         confidential by the Company in accordance with the terms of the
         Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
         in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary,
         the Company (and each Representative of the Company) may disclose to
         any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment
         and any facts that may be relevant to the Tax structure of an
         Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent beginning on the earliest
         of (i) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating to
         such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the date of public announcement of
         such Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) the date of the execution of an
         agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into such Acquisition
         Proposal, provided, however, that neither the Company nor any
         Representative of the Company may disclose any other information that
         is not relevant to understanding the Tax treatment and Tax structure
         of such Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of any party and
         any information that could lead another to determine the identity of
         any party), or any other information to the extent that such
         disclosure could reasonably result in a violation of any federal or
         state securities laws. Parent shall cease and cause to be terminated
         immediately all existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
         conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with
         respect to Parent.

                  (ii) The Board of Directors of Parent shall not, except as
         expressly permitted by this Agreement (including this Section
         5.6(b)(ii)), (A) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
         withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the
         recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent to Parent's
         stockholders to approve the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the
         Merger and approve and adopt the Amended Parent Certificate of
         Incorporation (a "Parent Change in Recommendation"), (B) approve or
         recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
         transaction involving an Acquisition Proposal with respect Parent from
         a third party (a "Parent Alternative Transaction"), or (C) cause
         Parent to enter into any Acquisition Agreement related to any Parent
         Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to
         the approval and adoption of the Amended Parent Certificate of
         Incorporation and the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock
         in connection with the Merger by Parent's stockholders, the Board of
         Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after it has received a
         Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 5.6(b)(i) and after
         consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal
         counsel, that failure to take such action could result in a reasonable
         probability that the Board of Directors of Parent would breach its
         fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware law, the Board of Directors
         of Parent may (subject to this and the following sentences in this
         Section 5.6(b)(ii)) (1) make a Parent Change in Recommendation, (2)
         approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
         such Superior Proposal (either clause (1) or (2) above being a "Parent
         Subsequent Determination") and (3) authorize Parent to and cause
         Parent to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
         Superior Proposal, but in each case only at a time that is after the
         fifth day (or the second day, in the case of a material amendment to a
         Superior Proposal) following the Company's receipt of written notice
         advising the Company that the Board of Directors of Parent is prepared
         to accept a Superior Proposal. Such written notice shall specify the
         material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and include a
         copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing),
         identify the person making such Superior Proposal and state that the
         Board of Directors of Parent intends to make a Parent Subsequent
         Determination or authorize Parent to and cause Parent to enter into an
         Acquisition Agreement. During such five day period (or two day period
         in the case of a material amendment), Parent shall provide an
         opportunity for the Company to propose such adjustments to the terms
         and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Board of
         Directors of Parent to proceed with its recommendation to Parent's
         stockholders without a Parent Subsequent Determination.

                  (iii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
         Parent from (A) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
         contemplated by Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
         Exchange Act or (B) making any disclosure to Parent's stockholders if,
         in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent, after
         consultation with outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would
         be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that neither
         Parent nor the Board of Directors of Parent shall, except as
         specifically permitted by Section 5.6(b)(ii), make a Parent Change in
         Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
         or recommend, a Parent Alternative Transaction.

         Section 5.7. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
Litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

         Section 5.8. Indemnification; D&O Insurance.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause (including
by providing adequate funding to) the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, each present and former director and officer of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including with
respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the
extent provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company
Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to
any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been
provided to Parent and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the
Surviving Corporation's (or any successor's) Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time,
the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws.

         (b) Parent shall cause (including by providing adequate funding to)
the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in
effect for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies ("D&O Insurance") covered
by such policies (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions
which are, in the aggregate, not materially less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 5.8(b) more than an amount per year equal to one hundred seventy-five
percent (175%) of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more than one
hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of current annual premiums, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to one hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of
current annual premiums, and provided, further, that any substitution or
replacement of existing policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time.

         (c) It is expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties (including
their heirs and representatives) to whom Section 5.8 applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section
5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, such
third-party beneficiaries.

         Section 5.9. Public Announcements. The initial press release
concerning the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be a joint press release. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by Law or requirements of the NYSE or The Nasdaq National
Market.

         Section 5.10. Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement.

         (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
(i) Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the
joint proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company and to the
stockholders of Parent relating to the meeting of Company's stockholders (the
"Company Stockholders' Meeting") and to the meeting of the Parent's
stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting") to be held to consider, in
the case of the Company's stockholders, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, and in the case of Parent's stockholders, the approval and adoption
of the Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation and the approval of the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger (such joint proxy
statement, as amended or supplemented, being referred to herein as the "Joint
Proxy Statement") and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the
"Registration Statement") in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included,
in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
the Merger. Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as
practicable, and, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement,
Parent shall take all or any action required under any applicable federal or
state securities laws in connection with such actions and the preparation of
the Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective, the
Company shall mail the Joint Proxy Statement to its stockholders and Parent
shall mail the Joint Proxy Statement to its stockholders.

         (b) Except as specifically permitted by Section 5.6(a)(ii), the Board
of Directors of the Company shall recommend to the Company's stockholders the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not make a Company Change in Recommendation.

         (c) Except as specifically permitted by Section 5.6(b)(ii), the Board
of Directors of Parent shall recommend to Parent's stockholders the approval of
the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger and approval and adoption
of the Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation and the Board of Directors
of Parent shall not make a Parent Change in Recommendation.

         (d) Except for an amendment or supplement (including by incorporation
by reference) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a Company Subsequent
Determination, a Parent Subsequent Determination, a Company Change in
Recommendation or a Parent Change in Recommendation, no amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by
Parent or the Company without the approval of the other party (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or Parent, as the case may be, from making disclosure (and
such disclosure in and of itself shall not be deemed to be a Company Change in
Recommendation or Parent Change in Recommendation, as the case may be) of the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been proposed, the identity of the person
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal. Parent and the
Company each will advise the other, promptly after they receive notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, of
the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by
the SEC for additional information.

         Section 5.11. Stockholders' Meetings.

         (a) The Company shall cause the Company Stockholders' Meeting to be
duly called and held as soon as practicable for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting as
soon as practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective. The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws
to duly call, give notice of and convene the Company Stockholders' Meeting.
Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has made a Company Subsequent
Determination or Company Change in Recommendation as permitted by this
Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting proxies in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, helpful to secure the vote or consent of such
holders required by the DGCL or this Agreement to effect the Merger.

         (b) Parent shall cause the Parent Stockholders' Meeting to be duly
called and held as soon as practicable for the purpose of voting on the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and the approval
and adoption of the Amended Parent Certificate of Incorporation and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent Stockholders' Meeting
as soon as practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective. Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Law, the Parent Certificate of Incorporation and the Parent Bylaws
to duly call, give notice of and convene the Parent Stockholders' Meeting.
Unless the Board of Directors of Parent has made a Parent Subsequent
Determination or Parent Change in Recommendation as permitted by this
Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from holders
of shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote at the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting proxies in favor of approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger and the approval and adoption of the Amended Parent
Certificate of Incorporation and shall take all other action necessary or, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, helpful to secure the vote or consent
of such holders required by the DGCL, the Listed Company Manual of the NYSE or
this Agreement to effect the Merger.

         Section 5.12. Composition of Board of Directors of Parent. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall expand the size of its Board of Directors
from eleven directors to fourteen directors. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to appoint three of the Company's current independent directors or
such other persons contemplated by this Section 5.12 to the Board of Directors
of Parent effective as of the Effective Time, which directors shall be proposed
by the Company. Such director nominees must be acceptable to Parent upon
evaluation in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines and
practices. If one or more of these positions cannot be filled by the Company's
current independent directors, the Company may propose other director nominees
that do not currently serve as directors of the Company for consideration by
Parent. Such directors shall be appointed to each of the three classes of the
Board of Directors of Parent such that their terms of office expire at the
annual meeting of stockholders of Parent in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

         Section 5.13. Undertakings of Parent. Parent shall perform, or cause
to be performed, when due all obligations of Merger Sub under this Agreement.

         Section 5.14. NYSE Listing. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger or upon the
exercise of Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

         Section 5.15. Employee Plans and Benefits and Employment Contracts.

         (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.15, the Company as
the Surviving Corporation shall (subject to Section 5.15(d)) continue
immediately following the Effective Time to maintain each Company Benefit Plan
(provided that the Company's severance plans and policies shall be continued to
the extent provided in the Retention Plan) and each of its generally applicable
employment related policies and practices as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time except as expressly agreed upon between the Company and Parent
or, if any such Company Benefit Plan only has one participant, between such
participant and Parent, for a transition period, which transition period may be
different for each such plan and which period shall be set by Parent based on
the time deemed necessary to effect a reasonable transition for such employees
from participating in each such Company Benefit Plan to participating in a
comparable Parent Benefit Plan, if any, maintained for similarly situated
Parent employees provided that (i) no transition period for any Company Benefit
Plan shall end before the sooner to occur of six months following the Effective
Time or December 31, 2004 (the "Transition Period"), (ii) Parent shall adopt
transition rules to prevent any loss of credit for participant and employer
contributions (but only to the extent recorded on the books and records of the
Company or the Company Financial Statements), payments, co-payments and the
like if a transition period for a Company Benefit Plan ends before the end of
the plan year for such plan and (iii) the Company as the Surviving Corporation
shall continue to maintain each such Company Benefit Plan subject to the same
rights the Company had immediately prior to the Effective Time to administer,
amend and terminate such plan.

         (b) In accordance with the provisions of Section 5.15(a) above, the
Company as the Surviving Corporation shall continue following the Effective
Time to maintain its generally applicable employment related policies and
practices, including those related to vacation time, sick leave, personal time
off and the like, for a transition period, which transition period may be
different for each such policy or practice and which period shall be set by
Parent based on the time deemed necessary to effect a reasonable transition for
such employees from being subject to any such policy or practice to being
subject to a comparable Parent policy or practice, if any, for similarly
situated employees of Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company as the Surviving Corporation to,
honor all vacation, sick time and other paid time off that has been accrued but
unused by the employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case solely to the extent the
Company has properly accrued for all such vacation, sick time and other paid
time off on the Company Financial Statements and provided further, however,
that no transition period for the Company's policies relating to vacation time,
sick leave, personal time off and the like shall end before the last day of the
Transition Period.

         (c) Parent shall treat an individual's employment as an employee by
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries the same as employment as an employee
by Parent for purposes of satisfying any service or eligibility requirement
under any Parent Benefit Plan and to determine the extent to which a benefit
earned under such a plan is non-forfeitable if such individual is employed as
an employee by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries at the Effective Time.

         (d) Parent shall provide to individuals who are employed by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and who remain
employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary after the Effective Time with
employee compensation and benefits that are comparable in all material respects
with the compensation and benefits that Parent provides to similarly-situated
employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

         (e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits and
obligations under the employment agreements listed in Section 3.14(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Retention Plan. Parent and the Company agree
that the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "change in control" or
"change of control" or similar transaction for purposes of the agreements and
plans set forth in Section 5.15(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any such agreement or
plan.

         (f) Nothing in this Section 5.15 shall confer any rights on, or
provide any remedies for, any employee or former employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries or on, or for, any person making a claim on behalf of any
such employee or former employee.

         Section 5.16. Certain Tax Matters.

         (a) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in Sections 6.2(d)
and 6.3(d) hereof. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-2(g).

         (b) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and
deliver to King & Spalding, tax counsel to Parent, and Skadden Arps, tax
counsel to the Company, certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the
parties and such law firms at such time or times as may be reasonably requested
by such law firms, including contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, at the time the Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement is
declared effective by the SEC and at the Effective Time, in connection with
such tax counsel's respective delivery of opinions, pursuant to Sections 6.2(d)
and 6.3(d) hereof, with respect to the tax treatment of the Merger. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts not to
take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to
take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of
the certifications and representations included in the certificates described
in this Section 5.16(b).

         (c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation,

agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, (i) if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any
of the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable fees and expenses (including

claim that results in a judgment against Parent, Parent shall pay to the
Company its reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in this Section 7.2 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in

provided, however, that after approval of the Merger by the Company's
stockholders, no amendment that requires the further approval of the Company's
stockholders shall be made without such approval having been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         Section 7.4. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the Company Stockholders' Meeting and the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (ii)
waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with
any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other party or with any
conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized
officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

with respect to clause (iii)(B) that such losses and diminution between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (when netted against revenues
