representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company (the "MERGER"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall

Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing

writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being
the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as
herein defined). Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "AGREEMENT" as
used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and
the Certificate of Merger. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take
place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as
the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE").

         1.3  EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law including Section 259 of the Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

         1.4  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.

                  (a)  At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that at the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall comply with Section 5.10(a) of the


                                                                          -2-


<PAGE>

Agreement and shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Appnet, Inc."

                  (b)  The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended; provided, that the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will comply with Section 5.10(a) of the Agreement.

         1.5  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

         1.6  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities, the following shall occur:

                  (a)  CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Each share of
Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Company including, with respect to
each such share of Company Common Stock, (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.6(e) and
(f)) into the right to receive 0.8 shares of Common Stock of Parent (the "PARENT
COMMON STOCK") (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in
Section 1.9). If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock
will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement.

                  (b)  CANCELLATION OF PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share of
Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.


                                                                          -3-


<PAGE>

                  (c)  STOCK OPTIONS; EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS. At the
Effective Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding
under Company's Incentive Stock Plan (the "CENTURY PLAN"), Company's 1996
Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1996 PLAN") Company's 1998 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan (the "1998 PLAN"), Company's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1999
PLAN") and the Company's Stock Purchase Plan (the "STOCK PURCHASE Plan") and,
together with the Century Plan, the 1996 Plan, the 1998 Plan and the Stock
Purchase Plan, the "COMPANY OPTION PLANS", including options under the Company
Option Plans issued after the date hereof in accordance with Section 4.1 of this
Agreement shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8 hereof.

                  (d) WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, all warrants to purchase
Common Stock then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.8 hereof.

                  (e)  CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of Common
Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (f)  ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. In addition, the Exchange Ratio
will be adjusted proportionately and appropriately in the event of any
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties made by the Company in Section
2.3 of the Agreement.

                  (g)  FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder)
shall, upon surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as defined in Section
1.7(c)) receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied
by (ii) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the
five (5) most recent days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market System ("NASDAQ").

         1.7  SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.


                                                                          -4-


<PAGE>

                  (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Parent shall select a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.

                  (b)  PARENT TO PROVIDE COMMON STOCK. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

                  (c)  EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock
were converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of fractional shares which
such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Except as specified in
Section 1.7(e), no transfer or other taxes will be assessed against the holders
of Company Common Stock in connection with such exchange, except as required by
law. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d)
as to dividends and other distributions, to evidence only the ownership of the
number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in
cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

                  (d)  DISTRIBUTIONS With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this
Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the
holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates.
Subject to applicable law, following


                                                                          -5-

surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the
record holders thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (e)  TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance
of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

                  (f)  REQUIRED WITHHOLDING. Each of the Exchange Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal
requirement, including, without limitation, any withholding related to Company
Stock Options or "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2).
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be

contrary in this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving

official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         1.8  NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof

pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the

provided in this Article I.

         1.9  LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event that any

representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock

Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement or
to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other than the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Delaware Law and
the Company Charter Documents). This Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement
have been duly and validly executed and delivered by Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitute
legal and binding obligations of Company, enforceable against Company in
accordance with their respective terms.

         2.5  NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.

violate the Company Charter Documents or the equivalent organizational documents
of any of Company's subsidiaries, (ii) subject to obtaining the approval of

event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under,
or materially impair Company's or any of its subsidiaries' rights or alter the
rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of Company
or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any material Contract to which Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Company or any of its
subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties are bound or affected
except (A) as set forth in Section 2.5(a) of the Company Schedule or (B) in the
case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, for any such conflicts, breaches,
violations, defaults or other occurrences that could not individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.


                                                                          -10-


<PAGE>

                  (b)  Section 2.5(b) of the Company Schedule lists all
material consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Company's or any of
its subsidiaries' agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be

result in a material loss of benefits to the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation as a result of the Merger.

                  (c)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Stock Option Agreement by Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement
by Company shall not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any court, administrative agency, commission,
governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (a "GOVERNMENTAL
ENTITY"), except (A) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), state securities laws ("BLUE SKY LAWS"), the
pre-merger notification requirements (the "HSR APPROVAL") of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT")
and of foreign Governmental Entities and the rules and regulations thereunder,
the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, and the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by Delaware Law and (B) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company or, after the Effective Time, Parent, or
prevent consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent the parties hereto from
performing their obligations under this Agreement.

         2.6  COMPLIANCE; PERMITS.

                  (a)  Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree applicable to Company or any of its subsidiaries or by
which its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, or (ii)
any material Contract to which Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or
by which Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, except for any conflicts, defaults or
violations that (individually or in the aggregate) would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. No investigation or review by any governmental or
regulatory body or authority is pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened against Company or its subsidiaries, nor has any governmental or
regulatory body or authority indicated to the Company an intention to conduct
the same, other than, in each such case, those the outcome of which could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of the Company or have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (b)  Company and its subsidiaries hold all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental
authorities which are material to operation of the business of Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the "COMPANY PERMITS"). Company and
its subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of
the


                                                                          -11-

aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

         2.7  SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                  (a)  Company has filed all the forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by Company with the SEC since June 30, 1999 (the
"COMPANY SEC REPORTS"). The Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (and if amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of Company's subsidiaries is required to file any reports or
other documents with the SEC.

                  (b)  Each set of consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company
SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, do not contain footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
Exchange Act) and each fairly presents the consolidated financial position of
Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated,
except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to
normal and recurring adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material to the Company.

                  (c)  Company has previously furnished to Parent a complete
and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been
filed with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents
or other instruments which previously had been filed by Company with the SEC
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

         2.8  NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Neither Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of
a nature required to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to
the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which
are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of
operations or financial condition of Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except (i) liabilities provided for in Company's balance sheet as of
March 31, 2000, (ii) liabilities disclosed in Section 2.8 of the Company
Schedule or (iii) liabilities incurred since March 31, 2000 in the ordinary

whole.

(whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of Company's or any of
its subsidiaries' capital stock, or any purchase, redemption or other
acquisition by Company of any of Company's capital stock or any other securities
of Company or its subsidiaries or any options, warrants, calls or rights to
acquire any such shares or other securities except for repurchases from
employees following their termination pursuant to the terms of their
pre-existing stock option or purchase agreements, (iii) any split, combination
or reclassification of any of Company's or any of its subsidiaries' capital
stock, (iv) any granting by Company or any of its subsidiaries of any increase
in compensation or fringe benefits, except for normal increases of cash

or any of its subsidiaries of any bonus, except for bonuses made in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice (other than to officers or
directors of the Company), or any granting by Company or any of its subsidiaries
of any increase in severance or termination pay or any entry by Company or any
of its subsidiaries into any currently effective employment, severance,
termination or indemnification agreement or any agreement the benefits of which
are contingent or the terms of which are materially altered upon the occurrence
of a transaction involving Company of the nature contemplated hereby, (v) entry
by Company or any of its subsidiaries into any licensing or other agreement with

practice or any amendment or consent with respect to any licensing agreement
filed or required to be filed by Company with the SEC, (vi) any material change
by Company in its accounting methods, principles or practices, except as
required by concurrent changes in GAAP, or (vii) any revaluation by Company of
any of its assets, including, without limitation, writing down the value of

investigation pending or threatened) against Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any properties or rights of Company or any of its subsidiaries, before any
court, arbitrator or administrative, governmental or regulatory authority or
body, domestic or foreign, which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

of Parent and its subsidiaries is in possession of all Approvals necessary to
own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to have such Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         3.2  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. Parent has previously
furnished to Company complete and correct copies of its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to date (together, the "PARENT CHARTER

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

      5.1 PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS; REGISTRATION STATEMENT; OTHER FILINGS;
BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS.

                  (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Company and Parent will prepare, and file with the SEC, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Parent will prepare and file with the SEC the S-4 in
which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Parent and Company shall provide promptly to the other such information
concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in the
reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4, or in
any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4. Each of Company and Parent will respond to any
comments of the SEC, and will use its respective commercially reasonable efforts
to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest
practicable time after the S-4 is declared effective by the SEC. As promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of Company and Parent will
prepare and file any other filings required to be filed by it under the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act or any other Federal, foreign or Blue Sky or related
laws relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "OTHER FILINGS"). Each of Company and Parent will notify the other promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the S-4, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing or for additional information and will
supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the S-4, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any Other Filing. Each of Company and Parent
will


                                                                            -34-
<PAGE>

cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other
regulatory authorities under this Section 5.1(a) to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the S-4
or any Other Filing, Company or Parent, as the case may be, will promptly inform
the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of Company,
such amendment or supplement.

                  (b) The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
include the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company in
favor of adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger.

         5.2  MEETING OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS.

                  (a)  Promptly after the date hereof, Company will take all
action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and the Company Charter
Documents to convene the Company Stockholders' Meeting to be held as promptly as
practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under applicable law)
within 45 days after the declaration of effectiveness of the S-4, for the
purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 5.2(c),
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger and will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or
Delaware Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders' Meeting to the extent there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.
Company's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be
limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

                  (b)  Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board of Directors
of Company shall unanimously recommend that Company's stockholders vote in favor
of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting; (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has
unanimously recommended that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt
and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting;
and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Board
of Directors of Company that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt
and approve this Agreement and the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, said
recommendation of the Board of Directors shall be deemed to have been modified
in a manner adverse to Parent if said recommendation shall no longer be
unanimous.


                                                                            -35-
<PAGE>

                  (c)  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Directors of Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
unanimous recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as
defined below) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) neither Company
nor any of its representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in Section 5.4, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such
recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under applicable
law. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall limit Company's obligation to
hold and convene the Company Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of whether the
unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
been withdrawn, amended or modified). For purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR
OFFER" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party
to consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 35% of the equity interest
in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (ii) a sale or other
disposition by Company of assets (excluding inventory and used equipment sold in
the ordinary course of business) representing in excess of 85% of the fair
market value of Company's business immediately prior to such sale, or (iii) the
acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an
exchange offer or issuance by Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial
ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in
excess of 85% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company, in each case on terms that the Board of Directors of
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation as to whether such offer
is more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view
than the terms of the Merger) to be more favorable to the Company stockholders
from a financial point of view than the terms of the Merger; provided, however,
that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any
financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is
not committed and is not likely in the judgment of Company's Board of Directors
to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

         5.3  CONFIDENTIALITY; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                  (a)  The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent
have each previously executed and delivered confidentiality agreements dated
June 3, 2000 (each, a "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), which Confidentiality
Agreements will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms; provided, however, that the "standstill" provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement delivered by Parent for the benefit of Company shall
terminate on the date of this Agreement.

                  (b)  Company will afford Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to the properties, books, records and personnel of Company during the period
prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information


                                                                            -36-
<PAGE>

concerning the business, including the status of product development efforts,
properties, results of operations and personnel of Company, as Parent may
reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

                  (c)  Parent will afford Company and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent during the period
prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the business,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
operations and personnel of Parent, as Company may reasonably request. No
information or knowledge obtained by Company in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.

         5.4  NO SOLICITATION.

                  (a)  From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company
and its subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions
with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) subject to
Section 5.2(c), approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v)
enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement
or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction
(as defined below). Company and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing two sentences, the Company may participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish information with respect to the Company pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement (including a standstill agreement therein) with
terms no less favorable to the Company than those in effect between the Company
and Parent to any Person if and only if (x) such Person has submitted an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Company's Board of
Directors, (y) neither the Company nor any of the Company Representatives shall
have violated the foregoing two sentences and (z) the Board of Directors of the
Company (i) determines by a majority vote in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with outside counsel, that such Acquisition proposal is a Superior
Offer and taking such action is necessary to satisfy the fiduciary duties of
such Board under applicable law and (ii) provides prior written notice to Parent
of its decision to so participate or furnish. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
two sentences by any officer or director of Company or any of its subsidiaries


                                                                            -37-
<PAGE>

or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of Company
or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4 by
Company. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall (i) provide Parent with
at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as
provided to the members of Company's Board of Directors but in no event less
than eight hours) of any meeting of Company's Board of Directors at which
Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider a Superior Offer
and (ii) provide Parent with at least one (1) business day prior written notice
of a meeting of Company's Board of Directors at which Company's Board of
Directors is reasonably expected to recommend a Superior Offer to its
stockholders and together with such notice a copy of the definitive
documentation relating to such Superior Offer.

         For purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall mean any
offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION
TRANSACTION" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from the Company by any person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of more than a 20% interest in the total outstanding voting
securities of the Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially
owning 20% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or
any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any sale, lease (other
than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other
than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of more
than 20% of the assets of the Company; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of
the Company.

                  (b)  In addition to the obligations of Company set forth
in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.4, Company as promptly as practicable shall
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request received by Company for
information which Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by Company with
respect to or which Company reasonably should believe would lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making
any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

         5.5  PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Parent and Company will consult with each
other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement
or an Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
law or by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The parties have agreed to the
text of the joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement.


                                                                            -38-

         5.6  REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.

                  (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (iv) the defending of any
suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, (v) lift or rescind the effects of any injunction, judgment
or order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transaction contemplated hereby and (vi) the execution or delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Company and its Board of
Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to require Parent or Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital
stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or
exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

                  (b)  Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement.


                                                                         -39-
<PAGE>

                  (c)  Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of any
representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate, of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such
that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be
satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

         5.7  THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. As soon as practicable following the
date hereof, Parent and Company will each use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its
subsidiaries' respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to
be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

         5.8 STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND RETENTION
BONUSES AND OPTIONS.

                  (a)  STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and any right to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") under
the Company Option Plans, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger
be assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same (but no additional
restrictions on vesting or other requirements) terms and conditions of such
options immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
qualified or nonqualified option status and any repurchase rights or vesting
provisions and provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting on certain
transactions, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

                  (b)  WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, the Warrants will be
assumed by Parent. Each Warrant so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same (but no additional restrictions on
vesting or other requirements) terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
warrant agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each
Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time


                                                                            -40-
<PAGE>

multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the share of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Warrant will be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

                  (c)  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

                           (i) Parent agrees that individuals who are employed
by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become employees of the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries upon the Effective Time (each such employee, a "COMPANY EMPLOYEE");
provided, however, that this Section 5.8(c) shall not be construed to limit the
ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee at any time.

                           (ii) After the Effective Time and on a schedule
determined by Parent in connection with its integration of its business with
that of the Company, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in
the employee benefit plans of Parent (including Parent's employee stock purchase
plan) to the same extent as any similarly situated and geographically located
employee of Parent. The Company Employees will be allowed credit for their
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting,
calculating the number of vacation days to which such employees are entitled,
and participation only and for entitlement and benefit accrual purposes, with
respect to the employee benefit plans in which such Company Employees
participate following the Effective Time.

                           (iii) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be adopted prior to the
Effective Time resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors to cease all
contributions to the any and all 401(k) plans maintained or sponsored by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "401(k) PLANS"), and to
terminate the 401(k) Plans, on the day preceding the Effective Time. Such
resolutions shall provide (to the extent required under Section 411 of the Code)
that all participants shall be fully vested in their account balances under the
401(k) Plans. Such resolutions shall also authorize distributions of 401(k)
Plans balances to participants (to the extent permitted under Section 401(k)(10)
of the Code) as soon as practicable following the termination of each such
401(k) Plan and, if elected by Parent, the Company's receipt from the Internal
Revenue Service of a favorable determination letter regarding the tax-qualified
status of the 401(k) Plans following its termination. The Company shall deliver
to Parent an executed copy of such resolutions as soon as practicable following
their adoption by Company's Board of Directors and shall fully comply with such
resolutions.

                  (d)  RETENTION BONUSES AND OPTIONS. Following the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company will use best efforts
to implement the performance incentives described in Section 5.8(d) of the
Parent Schedule.


                                                                            -41-

         5.9  FORM S-8. Parent agrees to file, if available for use by
Parent, a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options as soon as is
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time.

         5.10  INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and its
directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") and any indemnification provisions under the Company
Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable
to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company Charter Documents
as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or
agents of Company, unless such modification is required by law.

                  (b)  Parent shall cause to be maintained for a period of
three years from the Effective Time the Company's current directors and officers
insurance policy (the "COMPANY'S D&O INSURANCE") to the extent that it provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for all Persons who
are directors and officers of the Company on the date of this Agreement, so long
as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of the lesser of $750,000
or 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement
(such amount, the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"). Upon request by Parent, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to extend coverage under the Company's D&O
Insurance by obtaining a three-year "tail" policy (provided, that the lump sum
payment to purchase such coverage does not exceed three times the Maximum
Premium) and such "tail" policy shall satisfy Parent's obligations under this
Section 5.10(b). Parent's obligations under this Section 5.10(b) shall also be
satisfied if Parent's directors and officers insurance provides (or is amended
to provide) substantially similar coverage for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time for Persons who are directors and officers of the Company on the
date of this Agreement. If the Company's existing directors and officers
insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such three-year period or a
"tail" policy cannot be purchased on the terms set forth above and Parent cannot
or determines not to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.10(b) pursuant
to the preceding sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be obtained as much directors and officers insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Company's
D&O Insurance.

                  (c)  The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder and the heirs and representatives of such Person.


                                                                            -42-

         5.11  NASDAQ LISTING. Parent agrees to cause the listing prior to
the Effective Time on Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and
those required to be reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Options
and Company Warrants, in connection with the Merger, subject to official notice
of issuance.

         5.12  COMPANY AFFILIATE AGREEMENT. Set forth in Section 5.12 of the
Company Schedule is a list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in
Company's reasonable judgment, affiliates of Company within the meaning of Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act (each, a "COMPANY AFFILIATE"). Company
will provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent reasonably
requests for purposes of reviewing such list. Company has caused each Company
Affiliate to enter into a Company Affiliate Agreement concurrently herewith and
each Company Affiliate Agreement will be in full force and effect as of the
Effective Time. Parent will be entitled to place appropriate legends on the
certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by a Company
Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock,
consistent with the terms of the Company Affiliate Agreement.

         5.13  [RESERVED]

         5.14  NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENTS. Following the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and Company will use best efforts to enter into or
confirm the non-competition arrangements as described in Section 5.8(d) of the
Parent Schedule.

         5.15  REGULATORY FILINGS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. As soon as may be
reasonably practicable, Company and Parent each shall file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms
relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as
well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger
notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as
agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent each shall promptly (a) supply the
other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of
any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to agree to any divestiture
by Parent or the Company or any of Parent's subsidiaries or affiliates of shares
of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or its
subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company, its affiliates, or the imposition
of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

         5.16  ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION STRUCTURE. At the election of Parent
and upon the consent of the Company (which shall not be reasonably withheld),
the parties agree to amend the Agreement to provide that the acquisition of
Company by Parent be accomplished by means of an exchange offer of Parent Common
Stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock


                                                                            -43-
<PAGE>

pursuant to a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement filed with the SEC on
Schedule 14D-9; provided, however, that the parties will not adopt such
alternative transaction structure if such structure, by itself, would (i) fail
to result in a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code,
(ii) change the Exchange Ratio, or (iii) otherwise adversely affect the Company
or its stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.


                                   ARTICLE VI

contemplated hereby will have expired or terminated early and all material
foreign antitrust approvals required to be obtained prior to the Merger in

respectively), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to them, to the
effect that the Merger will constitute a tax-free reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and such opinions shall not have been
withdrawn; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the counsel to either Parent or the
Company does not render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed
to be satisfied with respect to such party if counsel to the other party renders
the opinion to such party that the Merger will constitute a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to
this Agreement agree to make such customary representations as requested by such
counsel for the purpose of rendering such opinions.

cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such
date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

                  (c)  by either Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any

nonappealable;

                  (d)  by either Company or Parent if the required approval
of the stockholders of Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have

of Company stockholders duly convened therefor or at any adjournment thereof;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this


                                                                            -46-

shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the Closing Date,
provided, that if such inaccuracy in Parent's and Merger Sub's representations
and warranties or breach by Parent and Merger Sub is curable by Parent through
the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) for thirty (30) days after
delivery of written notice from Company to Parent of such breach, provided

is curable by Company through the exercise of its commercially reasonable
efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f)
for thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice from Parent to Company of
such breach, provided Company continues to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such breach (it being understood that Parent may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (f) if it shall have materially
breached this Agreement or if such breach by Company is cured during such thirty
(30)-day period);

proviso therein is applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery of written
notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of the

Section 7.3 and Article 8 (General Provisions), each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party

         7.3  FEES AND EXPENSES.

                  (a)  GENERAL. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that
Parent and Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than

immediately available funds, within one (1) business day after demand by Parent,
an amount equal to $38.472 million plus any Parent Stipulated Expenses (as
defined below) incurred by Parent in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby (the "Termination Fee") if:

                           (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 7.1(g) or (h).

                           (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) or (d) and any of the
following shall occur (provided, however, that in the case of termination

Expenses immediately after such termination regardless of whether either of the
following shall occur):

                                    a) if following the date hereof and prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting, a third party has announced an Acquisition
Proposal and within twelve (12) months following the termination of this
Agreement a Company Acquisition (as defined below) is consummated; or

                                    b) if following the date hereof and prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting, a third party has announced an Acquisition
Proposal and within twelve (12) months following the termination of this
Agreement the Company enters into an agreement or letter of intent providing for
a Company Acquisition. As used in this Agreement, the term "PARENT STIPULATED

                           (iii) The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a
timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b), the Company shall pay

fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b) at the prime rate of The Chase
Manhattan Bank in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

this Agreement, "COMPANY ACQUISITION" shall mean any of the following
transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i) a

representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market value of the
Company's business immediately prior to such sale or (iii) the acquisition by

issuance by the Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a
right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of
the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

         7.4  AMENDMENT. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of Parent and Company; provided, however, that,
after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment
may be made which would reduce the amount or change the type of


                                      -49-
                                                                          <PAGE>

upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by all of the parties hereto.

         7.5  EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,

hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit

this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

         8.1  NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties of Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time, and only the covenants

         8.3       INTERPRETATION; KNOWLEDGE.

                  (a)  When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
indicated the words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity,
such reference shall be deemed to include the business of all direct and
indirect subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to the subsidiaries of an entity
shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity.


                                                                            -51-

                  (b)  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "KNOWLEDGE"
means with respect to a party hereto, with respect to any matter in question,
that any of the executive officers of such party has actual knowledge of such
matter.

                  (c)  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT" when used in connection with an entity means any change, event,
violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that is materially adverse to the
business, assets (including intangible assets), capitalization, financial
condition or results of operations of such entity and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole; provided, however, that in no event shall a decline in the market price
of an entity's publicly traded securities, general economic conditions or
industry-wide developments generally affecting substantially all comparable
companies constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d)  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "PERSON"
shall mean any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation),
general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint
venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability company or
joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association, organization,
entity or Governmental Entity.

         8.4  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

         8.5  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in
Section 5.10.

         8.6  SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree
to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.


                                                                            -52-

         8.7  OTHER REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

         8.9  RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding
or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

         8.10  ASSIGNMENT. No party may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING

THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
