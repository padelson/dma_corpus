ARTICLE III

 

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(such shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive $6.85 in cash, without interest (the 

 



13  " _Merger Consideration_ "), and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Taxes. All of the Shares that have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3.1(a) shall
be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as
provided herein.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock Units and Other Equity-
Based Awards_.

(a) Each option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase one Share
granted under any employee or director stock option, stock purchase or equity
compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company (the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become an option with
respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each Company Stock
Option, in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and/or stock
option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the
Effective Time, (i) Parent and its compensation committee (the " _Parent
Compensation Committee_ ") shall be substituted for the Company and the
compensation committee of the Company Board administering such Company Stock
Plans, (ii) each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent may be exercised
solely for shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash, if so provided under the
terms of such Company Stock Option), (iii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Options shall be equal to
the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Options immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such
Company Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise
price under each such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding
up to the nearest cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to Company
Stock Options that are unvested, unexercised and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and which have an exercise price greater than the
Merger Consideration, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall automatically
terminate as of the Effective Time if not exercised prior to or as of the
Effective Time. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (iii)
and (iv) of the first sentence of this Section 3.2(a), each Company Stock
Option that is an "incentive stock option" or a nonqualified stock option
held by a US taxpayer shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code
and Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, so as
not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option,

 



14  within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise result in negative
tax treatment or penalties under Section 424 of the Code or Section 409A of
the Code.

(b) Each award of restricted stock units (" _Company RSUs_ ") representing
the right to receive one Share for each Company RSU granted under any Company
Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and
Parent shall assume the Company RSUs, in accordance with the terms of the
Company Stock Plans and/or restricted stock unit agreement by which each
Company RSU is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)
Parent and the Parent Compensation Committee shall be substituted for Company
and the compensation committee of the Company Board administering such Company
Stock Plans, (ii) the Company RSUs assumed by Parent shall represent the right
to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash, if so provided under the
terms of such Company RSU) upon settlement of such Company RSU promptly after
vesting (except to the extent the terms of the applicable restricted stock
unit agreement provide for deferred settlement, in which case settlement
shall be in accordance with the specified terms) and (iii) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each award of Company RSUs shall be
equal to the number of Shares subject to such award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, and in any event Parent shall convert any remaining fractional
share into the right to receive cash based on the terms of Section 3.1
(except that in no event shall any vesting restrictions applicable to a
Company RSU be accelerated unless so provided under the terms of such Company
RSU).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
may be reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2.

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement (in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Companys transfer agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration to which
the Companys shareholders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a).
Promptly after the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to make all payments pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to Section 3.1(a). The Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent, provided that (i) no such investment or losses
thereon shall relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation from making the
payments required by this Article III or affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of the Shares, and following any losses,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent to add to
the Payment Fund for the benefit of the Companys shareholders immediately
prior to the Effective Time in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such
investments shall be in short term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than 30 days and guaranteed by the United States and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States or in commercial
paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or

 



15  better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments
shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not
later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
(i) an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_
") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
Shares or (ii) uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), (A) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the customary procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal)
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.
In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such
Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b), each Share represented by
a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share (in each case other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of each Share theretofore represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.1(a),
without any interest thereon.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and The Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC
Payment.

 



16 (d) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
III, subject to delivery of all documents required hereunder and applicable
Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(e) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any Payment Funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration,
without any interest, payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement. 

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock
Options, Company RSUs or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger and who has properly demanded that the Company purchase such shares in
accordance with Chapter 13 of California Corporation Law (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. At the Effective Time, holders of Dissenting Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment
of

 



17  the "fair market value" of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California Corporation Law. If any
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or withdraws or loses the right
to dissent under Chapter 13 of the California Corporation Law, each such
Dissenting Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become
exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the time that such right under Chapter 13 of the California
Corporation Law has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a). The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any demands under Chapter 13 of the California
Corporation Law and attempted withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or compromise or settle, any such demands.

Section 3.6 _Adjustment in Shares_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Shares shall have been changed into, or exchanged for,
a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted as appropriate to provide the holders of Shares,
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Except (a) as disclosed or reflected in the Company SEC Documents filed prior
to the date of this Agreement (other than (i) any information (other than
historical factual information) in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements" sections of such Company SEC Documents and (ii) other forward-
looking statements in such Company SEC Documents) (it being agreed that any
such information shall be deemed disclosure only with respect to such
sections or subsections of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is reasonably apparent), or (b) as set forth in the disclosure
letter delivered by the Company to Parent concurrent with the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any information in a particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is reasonably apparent), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

(a) Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction

similar power and authority to own, lease

 



18  and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
failures to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or licensed or
in good standing as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) The Company has previously furnished or otherwise made available to Parent
a true and complete copy of the Companys articles of incorporation (the "
_Company Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full
force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of the
Company Charter or the Company Bylaws.

Section 4.2 _Capital Stock_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000
Shares and (ii) 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per

were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and were free of preemptive rights, (B) no Shares were held in

exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options issued pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans.

 

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the

outstanding Company Stock Options, including the number of Shares subject to
such award, the name of the holder, the grant date, the vesting schedule, and
the exercise or purchase price per share and (ii) all outstanding Company
RSUs, including the name of the holder, the grant date and the vesting

its Significant Subsidiaries maintains under which stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights or other compensatory
equity-based awards are outstanding. The Company has made available to Parent
each form of award agreement under the Company Stock Plans.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) and except for changes since June
21, 2013 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options or the
settlement of Company RSUs outstanding on such date, as of the date of this
Agreement, (i) there are no issued, reserved for issuance, outstanding or
authorized (A) Equity Interests of the Company, (B) securities of the Company

or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries is a party and (iv) there are no voting trusts,

or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party. Each outstanding
Equity Interest of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company that is a

each outstanding Equity Interest of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company
that is a limited liability company or a limited partnership is duly
authorized and validly issued, and each such share or other Equity Interest is
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens).

 

Section 4.3 _Authority_. The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and, subject to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the
holders of at least a majority in combined voting power of the outstanding
Shares (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "), to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity). As of the date hereof, the board of directors of the Company (the "
_Company Board_ ") has determined that this Agreement and the

interests of the Company, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement, and (c)
subject to Section 6.4, resolved to recommend that the Companys shareholders
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. The Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote or consent of
the holders of any Equity Interest of the Company necessary to approve this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate the Company Charter or
Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any of the
Companys Significant Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by

 



20  clauses (i) through (vi) of subsection (b) below have been obtained and all
filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or by
which any of their respective properties are bound, or (iii) subject to
obtaining the consents listed on Section 4.4(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default), or
result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any Material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a
party or by which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii), for any such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or
other occurrence that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,

and under state takeover laws, (ii) such filings required under the HSR Act
and the other applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) such filings required under the

the California Secretary of State as required by the California Corporation
Law, and (vi) any such consent, approval, authorization, permit,
action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _Subsidiaries_. The Company has no Subsidiaries other than the

contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or

in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries at the date thereof and the results of their operations
and cash flows for the periods indicated, all in accordance with GAAP. The
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including any
related notes thereto) included in the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q filed with the SEC since December 31, 2012 have been prepared in

likely to adversely affect in any material respect the

 



22  Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. There were no significant

since such date).

Section 4.7  _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be

(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) that could
reasonably be expected, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section

recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger (any of such actions, an "

Proposal, or (iii) publicly propose to take any such actions. Notwithstanding

reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof, and not
relating to any Acquisition Proposal has occurred (such fact, event, change,
development or circumstance, an " _Intervening Event_ ") and the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be a breach of the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board or any committee
thereof may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, or (B) the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal, with respect to which no breach of Section
6.4 has occurred, and that the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not terminate this

 



38  Agreement pursuant to the preceding clause (B) unless the Company has first
complied with the provision of Section 6.4(e) and, after so complying, the
Company Board or any committee thereof determines that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(e) The Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not take any action
set forth in Section 6.4(c) unless the Company Board has first (i) (A) in the
case of Section 6.4(d)(A), provided written notice to Parent (a " _Notice
of Intervening Event_ ") advising Parent of the occurrence of an Intervening
Event, which notice shall specify the facts, events, changes, developments and
circumstances constituting such Intervening Event, or (B) in the case
of Section 6.4(d)(B), provided written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board has received a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, identify the Person making such
Superior Proposal and include a copy of any relevant transaction documents (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal, which shall require a new notice period of two Business
Days, and compliance with this Section 6.4(e) with respect to such new
notice), and (ii) negotiated, and caused the Company and its Representatives
to negotiate, during the three Business Day period following Parents receipt
of the Notice of Intervening Event or Notice of Superior Proposal (or two
Business Day period following an amended proposal), as applicable, or if at
the time received by the Company there are less than three Business Days (or
two Business Days in connection with an amended proposal) before the Company
Shareholders Meeting, as much notice as reasonably practicable (such period,
the " _Notice Period_ "), with Parent to enable Parent to make a counteroffer
or propose to amend the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) after complying
with the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), determined in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial
advisors), in light of any counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms of
this Agreement during the Notice Period, that, in the case of a Notice of
Intervening Event, the failure to do so would continue to be a breach of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law or, in the case of a
Notice of Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from (ii) making any required disclosure to the Companys
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its disclosure obligations under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in either case, any such disclosure
constituting an Adverse Recommendation Change must comply with the provisions
of Section 6.4(d) and Section 6.4(e).

 



39 Section 6.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_. 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this

and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have

practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any
amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information.

Statement by the SEC, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall
(i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") and (ii) except
to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.4(d), include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that the shareholders of
the Company vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening
the Company Shareholders Meeting (but not beyond the Termination Date) only
(A) if and to the extent necessary to provide any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement to the Companys shareholders in advance of a
vote on this Agreement and the Merger, as may be required by applicable Law,

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), additional time is necessary
to solicit additional votes or proxies.

such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would be

 



40  reasonably expected to, in the reasonable judgment of the Company (after
consultation with outside counsel), (i) breach any agreement with any third-
party, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other
privilege held by the Company, or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law,
including the Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case the
Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in
a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or
waive the applicable privilege or protection.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and shall cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

action under Regulatory Laws that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay

person, by telephone or otherwise, any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(iv) consulting and cooperating with each other in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.7(b), in
connection with obtaining any or all (A) expirations of waiting periods under
Regulatory 

 



42  Laws or (B) consents or approvals from any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent
shall not be required to effect or commit to: (i) selling, divesting,
licensing or otherwise conveying particular assets, categories, portions or
parts of assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries; (ii) agreeing to
sell, divest, license or otherwise convey any particular asset, category,
portion or part of an asset or business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Effective Time; (iii) licensing,
holding separate or entering into similar arrangements with respect to the

the Company or its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the
Effective Time; (iv) terminating any and all existing relationships

Section 6.8 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries to offer each employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who continues employment with Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ "), substantially similar compensation and benefits as
are offered to similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing in
this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to continue to employee any particular employee of the
Company or a Subsidiary, or (ii) shall be construed to prohibit the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan or program.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to use reasonable best efforts to, give Continuing
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit
accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plans) under any employee compensation, incentive and benefit
(including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for
the benefit of Continuing Employees as of and after the Effective Time by
Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Parent Plan_
") for the Continuing Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that
is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause there to be
waived any pre-existing condition, waiting period or eligibility limitations
that would have the effect of denying or delaying coverage to any Continuing
Employee or a spouse or dependent of a Continuing Employee (" _Covered
Persons_ ") compared to the rights enjoyed by the Covered Persons under
similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time 

 



43  and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Continuing Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days
thereafter, not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those
terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating
unit or Company Employee employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment of an existing employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates. No Company Employee shall have status as a third party beneficiary
with respect to enforcing a claim hereunder, and it is expressly acknowledged
that the continued employment of each employee of the Company is "at will"
and may be terminated by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, or such employees, at any time and for any or no reason.

Section 6.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or similar takeover Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting Agreements or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and
Parent and their respective board of directors shall take all action necessary
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent (on
behalf of itself and Merger Sub) shall promptly notify each other of (a) any
notice or other communication received by such party or its Representatives
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub or the prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relates to or is reasonably expected to affect the
prompt consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, has
caused or would cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article VII not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions
being materially delayed, (d) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event,
change, circumstance, effect or state of facts, individually or in the
aggregate, that has caused or is reasonably likely to cause any 

 



44  representation or warranty contained in this Agreement of such party to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (e) any material failure of
the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, or any officer,
director, employee, agent or Representative of the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent, as applicable, to comply with any covenant, or agreement to be
complied with under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not (i) cure any
breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or
(ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; 
_provided_ _further_ , that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to this
Section 6.10 shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set
forth in Article VII except to the extent that the underlying fact
or circumstance not so notified would, standing alone, constitute such a
failure.

Section 6.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now
existing in favor of each present (as of the Effective Time) and former
officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on
the date hereof and in the form previously made available to Parent, shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a period of
seven years after the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 2.5, (i) during such seven-year
period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the Surviving Corporation Articles or the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Party to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses, except to the extent required by Law, and (ii) in
connection with current pending Actions, including those listed in Schedule
6.11, expenses consistent with the budgets provided to Parent prior to the
date hereof shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of advancement of
expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this clause (ii) shall be
deemed to limit the Surviving Corporations obligation to advance expenses to
which the Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled or otherwise act as a
presumption that attorneys fees and expenses in excess of such budgets are
not reasonable. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and perform all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of, and all rights of advancement of
expenses to, any Indemnified Party as provided in any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company as in effect on the date hereof and in the
form previously made available to Parent.

(b) For a period of seven years after the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase or cause the Surviving

 



45  Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous in the aggregate to the Indemnified Parties than such policy
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ _further_ , that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 200% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 200% of
such last annual premium. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Company, at its option, may purchase, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, a seven-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and
conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering, without limitation, the transactions contemplated hereby. If such
prepaid tail policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the seventh anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action even if such disposition occurs after
the seventh anniversary of the Effective Time.

(d) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

 

Section 6.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take
such further steps as it determines may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or 

 



46  officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 6.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release
or make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless so
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system, provided that in each such case, the party
required to make such disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to allow the other parties a reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance or public disclosure.

 

Section 6.14 _Shareholder Litigation_. In the event that any shareholder or
derivative claim or Action related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is filed, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company threatened, against the Company or the members of the Company
Board prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
(and in any event within two Business Days) of any such Action or threat and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect to the defense
or settlement of any such Action, and no settlement thereof shall be agreed
to without Parents prior written consent.

 

Section 6.15 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

(b) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii) and (A) at any time after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination under Section 8.1(b)(i) or the
taking of a vote to approve this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or publicly made known to the shareholders of the Company

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii); or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)

$9,400,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or

Injunction) and Section 7.3 are satisfied as of the date of such termination
(and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, such conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were
to occur), then Parent shall pay the Company a termination fee of $17,000,000
(the "Parent Termination Fee"), it being understood that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. 

(d) Payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire

three Business Days after such termination.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails
promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3, the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, shall pay to the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and

part of a party hereto to any such waiver shall be valid only if expressly set
forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any

course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have hereunder.

Section 9.9 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the

delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur and the parties hereto would not have an adequate remedy
at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that following the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1, the parties hereto shall only be entitled to
specific performance of the obligations of the respective parties under
Section 6.6 or Section 8.3. Without limiting the foregoing, in circumstances
where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the
Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger. Any such Action shall be in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law or in equity and
the exercise of such remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. Each of the parties hereto hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any Action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 9.10 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement.

effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is

 



56  held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party (which shall include the Company, on behalf of itself and on behalf
of the holders of Shares as third-party beneficiaries under Section 9.4), such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement
shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO AGENT, ATTORNEY OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (d) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER

this Agreement brought by any party (which shall include any Action by the
Company, on behalf of itself or on behalf of the holders of Shares as third-
party beneficiaries under Section 9.4) against any other party, the prevailing
party in such Action shall be entitled to receive its reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such Action.

Section 9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, have delivered to the other. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by
any other electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the same effect as
physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signatures. 

Section 9.15 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been

 



57  represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.

 

Section 9.16 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all
of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement.
Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete
performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its
respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance and not of collectability. Parent hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any
right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in
connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section
9.15.
