1.02(a)       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 8, 2000
(this "Agreement"), among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), B Acquisition, Inc., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"), and Benjamin Moore and Co., a New Jersey
corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company have each determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective shareholders for Parent to acquire the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS,
in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that Purchaser shall make
a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $3.33 1/3 per share, of the Company
("Shares") for $37.82 per Share (such amount, or any greater amount per Share
paid pursuant to the Offer, being the "Per Share Amount"), net to the seller
in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
the Offer;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has unanimously approved the making of the Offer and resolved to recommend
that holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer;  
WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each approved the merger (the
"Merger") of Purchaser with and into the Company in accordance with the
New Jersey Business Corporation Act, as amended ("New Jersey Law"), following
the consummation of the Offer and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to Parent\'s and
Purchaser\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser
have entered into a Shareholders Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the
"Shareholders Agreement"), with the shareholders named therein (the
"Shareholders"), pursuant to which the Shareholders have, among other things,
(1) agreed to tender all Shares owned by the Shareholders pursuant to the
Offer, (2) granted to Parent an option to purchase all of the Shares owned by
the Shareholders, and (3) agreed to vote all Shares beneficially owned by the
Shareholders in favor of the Merger and this Agreement and against any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein), in each case subject to and on the
conditions set forth therein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser and the Company
hereby agree as follows:     ARTICLE I   THE OFFER    SECTION 1.01.
The Offer. (a) Provided this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act")) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
but in no event later than seven business days after the public announcement
of the execution of this Agreement. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for
payment, and to pay for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that at least
the number of Shares that when added to the Shares already owned by
Parent, Purchaser or any subsidiary of Parent, if any, shall constitute two-
thirds of the then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (on a "fully
diluted basis" meaning the number of Shares outstanding, together with the
Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to options or
obligations outstanding at that date and which do not terminate upon
consummation of the Offer under any employee stock or similar benefit plans
or otherwise, whether or not vested or then exercisable) shall have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer and
to the satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the other conditions set forth
in Annex A hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any such
condition, to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer, and to make
any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided,
however, Purchaser may not (i) waive the Minimum Condition (except under
circumstances whereby the "Option" (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement)
is or, upon the expiration of the Offer, will be, exercisable in accordance
with its terms, provided that such Option is exercised by Parent or Purchaser
as soon as practicable after it becomes so exercisable and, upon any such
exercise, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied), (ii) decrease the
price per Share payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer in
addition to those set forth in Annex A hereto, (v) except as provided below,
extend the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
or (vii) make any other change in the terms or conditions of the Offer that
is otherwise adverse to the Company or the holders of Shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend
the Offer for up to 30 business days beyond the scheduled expiration date,
which shall be 20 business days following the commencement of the Offer, if,
at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to
Purchaser\'s obligation to accept for payment, and to pay for, the Shares,
shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived,
(ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation or
interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or the
staff thereof, applicable to the Offer, or (iii) extend the Offer for an
aggregate period of not more than five business days beyond the latest
applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of
this sentence, if, as of such date, all of the conditions to Purchaser\'s
obligations to accept for payment, and to pay for, the Shares are satisfied
or waived, but the number of Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer equals 75% or more, but less than 90%, of the
outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis, so long as the Purchaser
irrevocably waives the satisfaction of any of the conditions to the Offer set
forth on Annex A hereto (other than the Minimum Condition and the condition
set forth in paragraph (a) of Annex A hereto) that    2   subsequently
may not be satisfied during any such extension of the Offer. If, on the
initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer, (x) the sole
condition remaining unsatisfied is the failure of the waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR Act"), to have expired or been terminated, then Purchaser shall extend
the Offer from time to time until five business days after the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and (y) if the
condition set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of Annex A shall not have been
satisfied, the Purchaser shall, so long as the breach can be cured and the
Company is vigorously attempting to cure such breach, extend the Offer from
time to time until five business days after such breach is cured (provided
that Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond 30 business
days after such initial scheduled expiration date). The Per Share Amount
shall be net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and Section 2.08(e). Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, pay, as promptly as practicable after expiration of the Offer, for all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn. The Company shall not tender
Shares held by it or by any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Offer, except
pursuant to Section 2.07(b).   (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the
related letter of transmittal and all other ancillary offer documents (the
Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together with
all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively
as the "Offer Documents"). Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Shares as soon as practicable
following the commencement of the Offer. The Offer Documents shall comply in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, shall correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents (and shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
practicable) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In addition, Parent
and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any
comments that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such
comments and with copies of any written responses and telephonic notification
of any verbal responses by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel.   SECTION
1.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer and represents that (i) the Board, at a meeting duly called and held,
has unanimously (A) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including each of the Offer and the
Merger (collectively, the "Transactions"), are fair to and in the best
interests of the holders of Shares, (B) approved this Agreement and the
Transactions and (C) recommended that the holders of Shares accept the Offer
and approve this Agreement and    3    the Transactions, and (ii) JP
Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Financial Advisor") has delivered to the Board a
written opinion that the consideration to be received by the holders of
Shares pursuant to each of the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of
Shares from a financial point of view as of the date of such opinion. Except
as required by the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law after
having received advice from outside legal counsel, the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the
Board described in the immediately preceding sentence.   (b) On the date of
commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing, except
as required by the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law after
having received advice from outside legal counsel, the recommendation of the
Board described in Section 1.02(a), and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9
to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and
any other applicable federal securities laws. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply
in all material respect with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall correct promptly any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading, and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given an
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (and shall provide
any comments thereon as soon as practicable) prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel in writing with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of such comments and with copies of any written responses and
telephonic notification of any verbal responses by the Company or its
counsel.   (c) The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with, or
cause Purchaser to be furnished with, mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position
listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date,
together with all other available listings and computer files containing
names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and
beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser with such
additional information, including, without limitation, updated listings and
computer files of shareholders, mailing labels and security position
listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to
holders of the Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. Subject
to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall
hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall    4   deliver
to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or the
possession of their agents or representatives.   ARTICLE II   THE
MERGER    SECTION 2.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with New Jersey
Law, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) Purchaser shall be merged
with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").  
SECTION 2.02. Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable after the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing this Agreement or a certificate of merger or certificate of
ownership and merger (in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Department of Treasury/Division of Commercial Recording, in such form as is
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, New
Jersey Law. The Merger shall become effective on the date on which the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Department of
Treasury/Division of Commercial Recording or such other time as is agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such time
is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time". Prior to the filing of
the Certificate of Merger, a closing shall be held at the offices of Munger,
Tolles and Olson LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071 or
such other place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of confirming
the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth
in Article VII.   SECTION 2.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of
New Jersey Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers, immunities, purposes and franchises of the Company and Purchaser
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and
Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.04.
Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.07, at the Effective Time, the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the "Certificate
of Incorporation"), shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such
certificate of incorporation.   (b) Subject to the provisions of Section
6.07, the by-laws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and such by-laws.    5    SECTION 2.05.
Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   SECTION 2.06. Conversion of
Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities:   (a) Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other than any Shares to be
canceled pursuant to  Section 2.06(b)) shall be canceled and shall be
converted automatically  into the right to receive an amount equal to the Per
Share Amount in  cash (the "Merger Consideration"), payable, without
interest, to the  holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section  2.08, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such
Share. All such  Shares when so converted shall no longer be outstanding and
shall  automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and 
each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease  to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive  the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such  certificate in accordance
with Section 2.08(b) hereof, without  interest;   (b) Each Share held in
the treasury of the Company and each Share  owned by Purchaser, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned  subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no  payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto; and   (c) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of 
Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per  share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.07. Stock Options; ESPP. (a) The Company
shall take all necessary action to ensure that each outstanding stock option
(a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable and whether or not
vested, under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, 1993 Stock Option
Plan, or any stock option agreement or employment agreement (the "Company
Stock Option Plans") shall be canceled by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and each holder of a canceled Company Stock Option shall
be entitled to receive at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable
thereafter from the Company in consideration for the cancellation of such
Company Stock Option an amount (the "Option Spread") equal to the product of
(i) the number of Shares previously subject to such Company Stock Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share previously subject to such Company Stock Option. The Option Spread,
after reduction for applicable tax withholding, if any, shall be paid in
cash. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary
action to approve the disposition of the Company Stock Options and the Shares
in    6   connection with the Transactions to the extent necessary to
exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.   (b) The
Company shall take all actions necessary to pass-through tender rights with
respect to the Shares held on behalf of the participants in the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and to tender those shares for
which instructions are received in accordance with those instructions. The
Company shall receive the proceeds on behalf of the ESPP participants and
shall remit those proceeds to the participants after withholding the balance
of all outstanding amounts due under any promissory notes thereunder from the
proceeds received in respect of the Shares.   (c) The aggregate outstanding
balance with respect to the promissory notes issued under the Company Option
Plans and the ESPP as of October 31, 2000 is approximately $9,300,000.  
SECTION 2.08. Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books. (a) When and as
needed, Purchaser shall deposit or cause to be deposited (and Parent shall
provide all necessary funds and otherwise cause Purchaser to deposit), with a
bank or trust company designated by Parent or Purchaser (and
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the "Paying Agent")
for the holders of Shares, the funds to which holders of Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06(a). Such funds shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   (b) (i)
Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three business
days thereafter, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06(a) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such
Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for
the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment equal to the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on
the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable.    7    (ii) In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
as determined in accordance with this Article II, provided that the person to
whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a condition precedent to the
payment thereof, indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory
to it against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   (c) At any time following the sixth month after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such
Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
other similar law.   (d) At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (e) Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or Merger such amounts as Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code (as defined in
Section 3.10 of this Agreement) or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made.      8    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY    The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Purchaser that, except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent and Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"):   SECTION 3.01. Organization and
Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary (as
defined below) is a corporation or a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where (i) with respect to any Material Subsidiary,
the failure to have such governmental approvals and (ii) with respect to
any Subsidiary other than a Material Subsidiary, the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority and
governmental approvals, does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and each
Material Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. When used in connection with the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company ("Subsidiary"), the term "Material Adverse Effect" means any change,
effect, condition, event or circumstance (x) that is materially adverse to
the business, operations, the results of operations or the financial
condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) that
is materially adverse to the Company\'s ability to consummate the
Transactions, except to the extent that any such change, effect, condition,
event or circumstance that is materially adverse to the Company\'s ability to
consummate the Transactions is caused directly or indirectly by any action or
inaction of Parent or Purchaser in breach of this Agreement;
provided, however, that "Material Adverse Effect" shall not include any
change, effect, condition, event or circumstance arising out of or
attributable to (i) any decrease in the market price of the Shares (but not
any change, effect, condition, event or circumstance underlying such decrease
to the extent that it would otherwise constitute a Material Adverse Effect),
(ii) changes, effects, conditions, events or circumstances that generally
affect the industries in which the Company or the Subsidiaries operate
(including legal and regulatory changes), (iii) general economic conditions
or changes, effects, conditions or circumstances affecting the securities
markets generally or (iv) changes arising from the consummation of the
Transactions or the announcement of the execution of this Agreement.   (b)
Each Subsidiary that is a "Significant Subsidiary," as defined in Rule 405 of
the Securities Act, or is otherwise material to the financial condition or
results of operation of the Company is so identified in Section 3.01(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule and is referred to herein as a
"Material Subsidiary".     9    SECTION 3.02. Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and
the By-laws, each as amended to date, of the Company. Such Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws are in full force and effect. Neither the Company
nor any Material Subsidiary is in material violation of any of the provisions
of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational
documents.   SECTION 3.03. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 120,000,000 Shares and 500,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $10.00 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). As
of the date hereof, (i) 26,469,381 Shares are issued and outstanding, all of
which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) 13,023,555
Shares are held in the treasury of the Company, and (iii) 1,288,906 Shares
are reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock
options granted pursuant to the Company\'s Stock Option Plans. As of the date
hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding.
Except as set forth in this Section 3.03, there are not, and, as of the
Effective Time, there will not be, any shares of capital stock issued and
outstanding (other than the issuance of Shares pursuant to the exercise of
outstanding employee stock options granted prior to the date hereof pursuant
to the Company\'s Stock Option Plans as set forth in this Section 3.03), or
any options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
of the Company or any Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary
to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, the Company or any Subsidiary. All Shares subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any Shares or any capital stock of any Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or any other person.   (b) The Company owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of each of its Material Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens,
charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and security interests
whatsoever which would reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, and all such shares are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.  
SECTION 3.04. Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Company has
all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company
of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of
this Agreement by the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding Shares,
if and to the extent required by applicable law, and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by New Jersey Law).
This Agreement has been    10   duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Purchaser, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including,
without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws, now or hereafter in
effect, affecting creditors\' rights generally and subject to the effect of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).   SECTION 3.05. No Conflict; Required
Filings and Consents. (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any Material
Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any law, statute, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Material
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Material
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under, result in the loss of a material benefit
under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on
any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation, except, with respect to clauses
(ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
other occurrences that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any governmental, administrative or regulatory authority or
agency, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Authority"), except (i) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the pre-merger
notification requirements of the HSR Act, the notification requirements of
the Competition Act (Canada), R.S. 1985, c.C-34, as amended ("Canadian
Competition Act"), the requirements of the Industrial Site Recovery Act of
the State of New Jersey, N.J.S.A. 13:1k-6, et seq. ("ISRA") and filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by New Jersey Law,
and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations
or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under
this Agreement, and do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.06. Compliance. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (i)
any Law applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (ii) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any
property or asset of the Company or any    11   Subsidiary is bound or
affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations
that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses as presently conducted except where the failure
to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such
noncompliance or default would not, when aggregated with all other
such failures, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  
SECTION 3.07. SEC Filings; Financial Statements. (a) The Company has filed
all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC
since January 1, 1998 (collectively, including any exhibits or
schedules thereto, and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "SEC
Reports"). As of their respective dates and, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment, the SEC Reports (i) were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary is required to file any form, report
or other document with the SEC.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC
Reports complies as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto and was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and each
fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (except as otherwise noted therein and
subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments).   (c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Subsidiaries
as at December 31, 1999, including the notes thereto, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be
reflected on a balance sheet, or in the notes thereto, prepared in accordance
with GAAP, except for liabilities and obligations (i) incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
1999 or (ii) that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except
as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since
December 31, 1999 to the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and the
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice, (b) there has not been any
Material Adverse Effect, and no events have occurred that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed in the    12   SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, since June 30, 2000 to the date of this Agreement, none of
the Company or any Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken after the
date of this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set
forth in Section 5.01. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, since December 31, 1999, none of the Company or any
Subsidiary has taken any action referred to in Section 5.01(g).   SECTION
3.09. Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof, there is no litigation, suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary, or any material
property or material asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, before any court
or arbitrator or Governmental Authority that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary nor
any material property or material asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, is
subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
award of any Governmental Authority or arbitral panel that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.10. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Plans and
Material Documents. Section 3.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all bonus, stock
option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation,
retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental executive retirement plans
and excess benefit plan, severance or other benefit plans, programs, trusts,
or arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance, compensation or
other contracts or agreements, whether legally enforceable or not, to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, with respect to which the Company
or any Subsidiary has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to
or sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary,
(ii) each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any Subsidiary could
incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been
or were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or
any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA and (iv)
any material contracts, arrangements or understandings or any change of
control arrangements between the Company or any Material Subsidiary and any
employee of the Company or any Material Subsidiary including, without
limitation, any contracts, arrangements or understandings relating to a sale
of the Company or any Material Subsidiary (collectively, the "Plans"). Each
Plan is in writing and the Company has made available to the Purchaser a true
and complete copy of each Plan and each material document, if any, prepared
in connection with each such Plan, including, without limitation, (i) a copy
of each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary
plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the most
recently filed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500, (iv) the most
recently received IRS determination letter for each such Plan, and (v) the
most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement in connection
with each such Plan. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any express
or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (i) to create or
incur liability with respect to or cause to exist any other employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any contract or agreement to
provide compensation or benefits to any individual or (iii) to   
13   modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended through the date hereof (the "Code").   (b)
Absence of Certain Types of Plans. None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a
"Multiemployer Plan") or a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any
Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a
"Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the Plans (i) provides for the payment of
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person,
(ii) obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to pay separation, severance,
termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) obligates the Company or
any Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit that could fail to
be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of
the Code. None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical,
disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary.   (c) Compliance.
Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws,
regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation,
ERISA and the Code. The Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all
material obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in
material default under or in material violation of, and have no knowledge of
any material default or violation by any party to, any Plan. No action,
claim or proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course), which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, claim or
proceeding.   (d) Qualification of Certain Plans. Each Plan that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the
Code has timely received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and
each trust established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and no
fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or
letters from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such
trust.   (e) Absence of Certain Liabilities. To the knowledge of
the Company, there has not been any prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to
any Plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other
than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
arising in the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability
in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee
benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists
that could give rise to any such liability.     14    SECTION 3.11.
Labor Matters. (i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
persons employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, are there any activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any such employees; (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
breached or otherwise failed to comply with any provision of any such
agreement or contract, and there are no grievances outstanding against
the Company or any Subsidiary under any such agreement or contract; (iii)
there are no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of their respective
employees, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; (iv) there are no unfair labor practice complaints pending against
the Company or any Subsidiary before the National Labor Relations Board or
any current union representation questions involving employees of the Company
or any Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and (v) there is currently no strike, slowdown, work stoppage
or lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threat thereof, by or with
respect to any employees of the Company or any Subsidiary.   SECTION 3.12.
Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement. Neither the Schedule 14D-9
nor any information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer
Documents shall, at the times the Schedule 14D-9, the Offer Documents or any
amendments or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC or are first
published, sent or given to shareholders of the Company, as the case may be,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Neither the proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of the
Company in connection with the Shareholders\' Meeting (as
hereinafter defined) nor the information statement to be sent to such
shareholders, as appropriate (such proxy statement or information statement,
as amended or supplemented, being referred to herein as the "Proxy
Statement"), shall, at the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders of the Company, at the
time of the Shareholders\' Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any
statement which, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it
was made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which
omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any
earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
Shareholders\' Meeting which shall have become false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Purchaser or any
of Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s representatives for inclusion in the foregoing
documents. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement shall comply in all
material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.   SECTION 3.13. Real Property and
Leases. (a) Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, the Company and the Subsidiaries have sufficient title to or
leasehold interest in all their real properties necessary to conduct their
respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such exceptions as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.     15    (b) Each parcel of real property owned or leased by
the Company or any Subsidiary (i) is owned or leased free and clear of all
mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, conditional and installment
sale agreements, encumbrances, charges or other claims of third parties of
any kind, including, without limitation, any easement, right of way or other
encumbrance to title, or any option, right of first refusal, or right of
first offer (collectively, "Liens"), other than (A) Liens for current taxes,
assessments or other governmental charges not yet delinquent or which are
being contested in good faith, (B) inchoate mechanics\' and materialmen\'s
Liens for construction in progress, (C) workmen\'s, repairmen\'s,
warehousemen\'s and carriers\' Liens arising in the ordinary course of
business of the Company or such Subsidiary consistent with past practice, (D)
zoning laws and other land use restrictions that do not materially impair the
present use of the property, (E) Liens arising by reason of deposits to
secure public or statutory obligations in lieu of surety or appeal bonds
entered into in the ordinary course of business, and (F) Liens and other
imperfections of title and encumbrances that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, "Permitted
Liens"), and (ii) is neither subject to any governmental decree or order to
be sold nor is being condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any public
authority with or without payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, has any such condemnation, expropriation or taking
been proposed.   (c) All leases of real property and all amendments
and modifications thereto, are in full force and effect and have not been
modified or amended, and there exists no default under any such lease by the
Company or any Material Subsidiary, nor any event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the Company or any
Material Subsidiary, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.14. Intellectual Property. The
Company or its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all Intellectual
Property that is material to the operation of their businesses ("Company
Intellectual Property"), except for such failures to own or have rights to
use that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except for such infringements as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, to
the knowledge of the Company, the Company Intellectual Property does not
infringe the Intellectual Property of any third party, and no claim has been
asserted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the use of the
Company Intellectual Property infringes the Intellectual Property of any
third party. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of the Company, no person is engaging in any activity that
infringes the Company Intellectual Property. All Company Intellectual
Property is subsisting and in force, except for such failures to be so
subsisting and in force that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes hereof, "Intellectual Property"
means: (i) United States, international and foreign patents and patent
applications, (ii) trademarks, trade names and service marks, including
registrations and applications for registration thereof, (iii) copyrights,
including registrations and applications for registration thereof, (iv)
confidential and proprietary information, including trade secrets and know-
how and (v) domain names.     16    SECTION 3.15. Taxes. The Company
and the Subsidiaries have timely filed or will file all federal, state, local
and foreign Tax returns and reports required to be filed by them and have
paid and discharged all Taxes due whether or not shown thereon or have
adequate provisions in the Company\'s books and records to cover any
liability for such Taxes, other than (i) such payments as are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and (ii) such filings, payments or
other occurrences that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the IRS nor any other taxing authority or
agency, domestic or foreign, is now asserting or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatening to assert against the Company or any Subsidiary
any deficiency or claim for any Taxes or interest thereon or penalties in
connection therewith. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has granted any
waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a
period for the assessment of, any Tax. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code. There are no Tax liens
upon any property or assets of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries except
liens for current Taxes not yet due or for Taxes being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceeding. No audit of any material Tax return of the
Company or any Subsidiary is being conducted or has been threatened by the
IRS or any taxing authority or agency, domestic or foreign. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign
law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, otherwise. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no material
"deferred intercompany transactions" or "intercompany transactions" the gain
or loss in which would be required to be taken into account under the
consolidated return Treasury Regulations as a result of the Merger. As used
in this Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean all income, excise, gross receipts, ad
valorem, sales, employment, franchise, profits, gains, property, transfer,
use, payroll, intangibles or other taxes, fees, stamp taxes, duties, charges,
levies or assessments of any kind whatsoever (whether payable directly or by
withholding), together with any interest and any penalties, additions to tax
or additional amounts imposed by any Tax authority with respect thereto.

such    17   property; and (vi) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries are signatories to, or the subject of, or to the knowledge of
the Company, any of the properties are subject to, any agreement, order,
judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental

liability or obligations pursuant to or under any Environmental Laws.   (b)
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that (i) the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 3.16 are the only representations and warranties
being made with respect to compliance with or liability under Environmental
Laws or with respect to any environmental, health or safety matter, including

or investment banker (other than the Financial Advisor) is entitled to any
brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission in connection with the

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has the requisite power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to

this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to
the Merger, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by New Jersey Law). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser

benefit under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other
encumbrance on any property or asset of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a
party or by which Parent or Purchaser or any property or asset of either of
them is bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii),

hereunder, or prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Purchaser do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Purchaser will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit

Canadian Competition Act, ISRA and filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by New Jersey Law, and (ii) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such

material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to perform
their obligations hereunder, or prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Transactions.   SECTION 4.04. Financing. At or prior to the date that
Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant

Offer Documents shall not, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the
SEC or are first published, sent or given to shareholders of the Company, as
the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders of
the Company, at the time of the Shareholders\' Meeting and at the Effective
Time, contain any statement which, at the time and in light of the
circumstances under which it was made, is false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to

of proxies for the Shareholders\' Meeting which shall have become false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no
representation or warranty with respect to any    20   information
supplied by the Company or any of its representatives for inclusion in any of
the foregoing documents or the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents shall
comply in all material respects as to form with the requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.   SECTION 4.06.
Absence of Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent and Purchaser, threatened against Parent or Purchaser or any of their
respective properties or assets before any court or arbitrator or

or any of their respective affiliates beneficially own any Shares.  
SECTION 4.09. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to

subject to Article VII, to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause
the Merger to become effective, in accordance with Section 14A:10-5.1 of New
Jersey Law, as soon as reasonably practicable after such acquisition, without

at least two-thirds of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the
date of purchase, and (ii) compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, whichever shall occur later, Purchaser
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Board as shall give Purchaser representation on
the Board equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Board
(giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied
by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by
Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser following such purchase bears to the
total number of Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time,
promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchaser\'s designees to be
elected or appointed as directors of the Company, including increasing the

Effective Time, the Company shall retain as members of its Board at least two
directors who are directors of the Company on the date hereof. Following the
election of designees of Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.03, prior to

Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, any termination of this Agreement
by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser, or waiver of
any of the Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder, shall require the
concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who
were not designated by Purchaser.   SECTION 6.04. Access to Information;
Confidentiality. (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and the officers, directors,
employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford
the officers, employees and agents of Parent and Purchaser reasonable access
at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books
and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and shall furnish Parent and
Purchaser with such financial, operating and other data and information as
Parent or Purchaser, through its officers, employees or agents, may
reasonably request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require
either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to disclose any information
to Parent or its representatives if such disclosure would be in violation of
applicable laws or regulations of any Governmental Authority or (ii) disclose
any information about any person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to Parent or its representatives if such disclosure would be in
violation of the terms of any confidentiality agreement or provision in
effect on the date of this Agreement and to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party.   (b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated October 24, 2000 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Parent and the Company.   (c) No investigation or
receipt of information by Parent or Purchaser of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company set forth herein.   SECTION 6.05. No Solicitation
of Transactions. (a) Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties (other
than Parent or any of its affiliates or representatives) that may be ongoing
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. From the date hereof, the Company
shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, or employees or any
affiliate, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other advisor or representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any
inquiries relating to, or the submission of any    25   proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or, in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, furnish to any person any information or data with
respect to or access to the properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or take any other action to facilitate the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and following the receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes, or in the good faith judgment of the
Board would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and the
Company is not in material breach of any of its obligations under this
Section 6.05, the Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal and
subject to compliance with Section 6.05 (c), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement,
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement shall include a provision
prohibiting solicitation of key employees of the Company, such provision
lasting at least three years, and may not include any provision calling for
an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company advises
Parent of all such nonpublic information delivered to such
person concurrently with its delivery to the requesting party, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, provided that, prior to taking any such action, the Company
provides reasonable advance notice to Parent that it is taking such action;
provided, however, that as to each of clauses (x) and (y), the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable
Law. It is agreed that any material violation of the restrictions set forth
in the second sentence of this Section 6.05(a) by any officer of the Company
or any Subsidiary or any affiliate, director or investment banker, attorney
or other advisor or representative of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.05(a) by the Company except where
such violation of the restrictions set forth in the second sentence of this
Section 6.05(a) by any such person is not related to the transaction,
proposal or offer constituting a Superior Proposal which the Company engages
in discussions or enters into any agreement with respect thereto pursuant to
the terms of this Section 6.05(a). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer from any
person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of (A) 15%
or more of the assets of the Company or (B) over 15% of any class of equity
securities of the Company; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer as defined
pursuant to the Exchange Act that, if consummated, would result in any person
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company; or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, sale of all or a substantial part of the assets,   
26   recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
Transactions. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means (i) a
bona fide written proposal or offer from any person for a direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of (A) 50% or more of the assets of the Company or
(B) over 50% of any class of equity securities of the Company; (ii) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
person beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of equity securities of
the Company; or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, sale of all or a substantial part of the assets, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, other
than the Transactions, (x) which, if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders than the Offer and
the Merger (taking into account all relevant factors, including the
likelihood of such offer resulting in a consummated transaction), and (y) for
which there is no financing contingency and the third party has
demonstrated that financing is reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case
as determined by the Board in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel). Any Superior Proposal is an
Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Neither the Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval, determination of
advisability or recommendation by the Board or any such committee of the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement unless the Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
counsel, that the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement is no longer in the
best interests of the Company\'s shareholders and that such withdrawal or
modification is, therefore, required in order to satisfy its fiduciary duties
to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal (an "Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the Board determines (after consultation with
its outside counsel), prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law and the Company is
not in material breach of any of its obligations under this Section 6.05, the
Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and made
after the date hereof, take any of the actions described in clauses (ii)
or (iii) above; provided, however, that in no event may the Board take any
such action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) above earlier than the third
business day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice of the intention
of the Board to do so, including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal, and with respect to the action described in clause
(iii) only, attaching the most current version of any such Acquisition
Proposal or any draft of an Acquisition Agreement.   (c) The Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or
any request for confidential information, the material terms and conditions
of such request or the Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person
making such request or the Acquisition Proposal. The Company thereafter shall
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such
Acquisition Proposals or inquiries and the status of any discussions or
negotiations relating thereto.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05
shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders required by
applicable law.   SECTION 6.06. Employee Benefits Matters. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all
contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and   
27   commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or
former employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the bonus awards under the
Company\'s Long Term Bonus Plan will vest and become payable immediately
prior to the Effective Date in accordance with the terms of the plan in the
approximate aggregate amount of $4.63 million in accordance with the terms
set forth on Schedule 6.06(a). In addition, the annual bonus payable under
the Company\'s 2000 Incentive Award Plan shall be paid out as soon as
practicable after December 15, 2000 and otherwise in accordance with the
plan\'s terms.   (b) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of two
years immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide employee benefit and
compensation plans, programs, contracts and arrangements for the benefit of
current or former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries which, in the
aggregate, will provide benefits and compensation that provide substantially
comparable benefit levels and aggregate compensation value to those provided
to such employees as a group under the employee benefit and compensation
plans, programs, contracts and arrangements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that Parent shall not have any obligation to continue the stock
option, stock purchase or other plans involving the potential issuance of
securities of the Surviving Corporation or Parent but shall provide
alternative benefits with substantially comparable value; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall limit any reserved right to amend,
modify, suspend, revoke or terminate any such plan; and provided further,
however, that changes may be made to the extent necessary to comply with
applicable law.   (c) Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but
not for benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective
Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit.   SECTION 6.07. Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation as its sole shareholder to exculpate
and indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless any person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent (the "Indemnified
Party") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation (each, a "Claim") to the extent that any such Claim is based
on, or arises out of, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) this Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the extent that any
such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing, or
occurring prior to or at the    28   Effective Time, regardless of
whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the full extent permitted under applicable Law or the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or indemnification agreements in effect
at the date hereof, including provisions relating to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any action or suit; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for or otherwise be required to
indemnify an Indemnified Party with respect to any amounts paid in settlement
of any Claims without the written consent of Surviving Corporation (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any
capacity in any Claim of the type described above, then from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as its sole
shareholder to periodically advance (such advancement to be mandatory rather
than permissive) to such Indemnified Party its legal and other expenses
(including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred
in connection therewith), subject to the provision by such Indemnified Party
of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a
final non-appealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 6.07, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Corporation. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one
law firm to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict of interest or
a potential conflict of interest on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.   (b) All rights to
indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the
Indemnified Party as provided under applicable Law or the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws or indemnification agreements in effect
at the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in the event any Claim or Claims are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of any such Claim or Claims shall continue until disposition of
any and all such Claims; provided further, however, that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party\'s conduct
complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law, the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws or such agreements, as the case may
be, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party and reasonably acceptable to Parent.   (c) For a period of six years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as its
sole shareholder to maintain in effect the current policies of directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that
Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured parties) with
respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at
or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such
200% amount, the "Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage   
29   cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors\' and
officers\' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium; provided further, if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at
all, Parent shall purchase all available run-off insurance policies with
respect to pre-existing insurance in an amount that, together with all other
insurance purchased pursuant to this Section 6.07(c), does not exceed the
Maximum Premium. The Company acknowledges that policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance provided by National Indemnity Company upon
the terms set forth in this Section 6.07(c) may be substituted for the
current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained
by the Company. The Company represents to Parent that the current annualized
premium on current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company is no more than $142,700 in the aggregate.   (d)
In the event the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07. This Section
6.07 is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties.   SECTION 6.08. Further Action; Consents; Filings. (a) Each
party hereto will use its reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as possible, (ii)
to make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions required
under applicable Law and (iii) to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary
in connection with its execution and delivery of, and for the performance of
its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement. The Company and Parent each
agree to use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any action,
including legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order that is in
effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of any of
the Transactions.   (b) Each party will cooperate fully with the other party
in promptly taking the actions referred to in Section 6.04(a), including,
without limitation, by (i) making an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and the Canadian Competition Act with
respect to the Transactions within seven business days of the date hereof and
by supplying promptly any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) providing copies of
all filings and similar documents to the other party and its advisors prior
to filing and, if requested, by accepting all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested in connection therewith. The parties hereto will not
take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required approvals.     30    SECTION 6.09. Public
Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Company. Thereafter, until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or any Transaction and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by Law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange
to which Parent or the Company is a party.   SECTION 6.10. Minority Shares
of Benjamin Moore and Co., Limited. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than ten business days after the Effective Time,
Parent shall offer to acquire or shall cause any of its affiliates,
including, without limitation, the Surviving Corporation, to offer to
acquire, through a merger, tender offer or other transaction ("Minority
Purchase Transaction"), all outstanding shares of Benjamin Moore and Co.,
Limited, a Canadian corporation (the "Canadian Sub"), not owned by the
Surviving Corporation ("Minority Shares") for cash in an amount per share
equal to CDN$93.55 ("Canadian Per Share Price"). In addition, simultaneously
with the consummation of the Minority Purchase Transaction, Parent shall
cause Surviving Corporation to take all necessary action to ensure that each
outstanding stock option (a "Canadian Sub Stock Option"), whether or not
exercisable and whether or not vested, under the Canadian Sub\'s Stock
Option Plan, any stock option agreement or employment agreement, shall be
canceled by the Surviving Corporation simultaneously with the consummation of
the Minority Purchase Transaction, such that each holder of a canceled
Canadian Sub Stock Option shall be entitled to receive at the time of such
consummation or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Canadian Sub in
consideration for the cancellation of such Canadian Sub Stock Option an
amount (the "Canadian Sub Option Spread") equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Canadian Sub previously subject to such Canadian Sub
Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Canadian Per Share Price
over the exercise price per share of the Canadian Sub previously subject to
such Canadian Sub Stock Option. The Canadian Sub Option Spread, after
reduction for applicable tax withholding, if any, shall be paid in cash. The
aggregate purchase price for the purchase of the Minority Shares and the
cash-out of the Canadian Sub Stock Options is equal to approximately
CDN$17,542,673.   SECTION 6.11. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any material
failure of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; provided
further that this Section 6.11 shall not constitute a covenant or agreement
for the purpose of clause (c) or (d) of Annex A.     31    ARTICLE
VII   CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER    SECTION 7.01. Conditions to the Merger.
The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be

the HSR Act and the  Canadian Competition Act shall have expired or been
terminated;   (c) No Order. No Governmental Authority of competent

any Law or  injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is
then  in effect and has the effect of making the Merger illegal or
otherwise  prohibiting, precluding, restraining or enjoining consummation of
the  Transactions; and   (d) Offer. Purchaser or its permitted assignee
shall have  purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the  Offer; provided, however, that this condition shall not be
applicable  to the obligations of Parent or Purchaser if, in breach of this 
Agreement, Purchaser fails to purchase any Shares validly tendered and  not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.   SECTION 7.02. Conditions to Obligations
of Parent and Purchaser to Effect the Merger. The obligations of Parent and
Purchaser to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of the further
condition (which may be waived in whole or in part by Parent) that the
Company shall have performed in all material respects all material
obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement on or before
the earlier of (i) such time as Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s designees shall
constitute at least a majority of the Board pursuant to Section 6.03 and (ii)
the Closing held pursuant to Section 2.02; provided, however, that Parent or
Purchaser shall waive this condition if Parent or Purchaser shall not
designate their nominees as directors on the Board promptly after the
purchase of and payment for any Shares by Purchaser or any of its affiliates
pursuant to Section 6.03.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND
WAIVER    SECTION 8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated

this clause (i) shall not  be available to any party whose failure to perform
or fulfill any  obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted  in, the failure to complete the Offer on or prior to such date; 
provided further that the passage of such period shall be tolled  for any
part thereof during which any party shall be subject to a  nonfinal
injunction, order, decree, ruling or other action  restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation  of the Offer and the Outside Date
shall be extended day-by-day for  each day tolled; provided further, however,
that the Outside Date  shall not be extended past May 7, 2001; or   (ii)
any Governmental Authority or court of competent  jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or  entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling which is then in  effect and has the effect of making
consummation of the Merger  illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of
the Merger, which  injunction, order, decree or ruling has become final and 
non-appealable; provided, however, that the party seeking to  terminate this
Agreement shall have used its reasonable best  efforts to remove or lift such
injunction, order, decree or  ruling; or   (iii) the Offer shall have
expired, terminated or been  withdrawn pursuant to its terms without any
Shares being purchased  therein; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this  agreement under this clause (iii) shall not be available to
any  party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement  has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of Parent or  Purchaser to
purchase Shares in the Offer.   (c) By Parent if:   (i) due to an
occurrence or circumstance that, if occurring  after the commencement of the
Offer, would result in a failure to  satisfy any condition set forth in Annex
A hereto, Parent and  Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer on or
prior to  the seventh business day after the public announcement of the 
execution of this Agreement; provided that Parent may not  terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) if Parent or  Purchaser is in material

written request to do so, or (II) approved or  recommended, or proposed
publicly to approve or recommend, to the  shareholders of the Company an
Acquisition Proposal; or (B) the  Board or any committee thereof shall have
resolved to take any of  the foregoing actions; or   (d) By the Company
if:   (i) Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer within  seven
business days after the public announcement of the execution  of this
Agreement provided that the Company may not terminate this  Agreement
pursuant to this clause (i) if the Company is in  material breach of this
Agreement; or   (ii) it concurrently enters into a definitive agreement 
providing for a Superior Proposal entered into in accordance with  Section
6.05; provided that (A) prior thereto or simultaneously  therewith, the
Company shall have paid the Fee pursuant to Section  8.03, and (B) the
Company shall have complied with the provisions  of Section 6.05(b) and

of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement (other than Sections 6.04, 8.02, 8.03, 9.02, 9.04, 9.05, 9.07 and
9.08) shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability on the
part of any party hereto, provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any breach hereof.   SECTION 8.03.
Fees and Expenses. (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii), the Company shall pay Parent a fee of $25
million (the "Fee"), which amount shall be payable in immediately available

agreement as specified in such Section 8.01(d)(ii). In the event that (i) (x)
(I) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii), (II) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or
(III) the Offer has remained open for at least 20 business days and
the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied (and none of the events
described in paragraphs (a), (e) or (f) of Annex A shall have occurred so as
to result in a condition to the Offer not being satisfied and Parent shall
not have theretofore invoked any of the other conditions set forth in Annex
A) and this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section

have been made to the Company, and (z) on the date of such termination,
Parent is not in material breach of this Agreement and the Minimum Condition
has not been satisfied and (ii) a definitive agreement is entered into
providing for an Acquisition Proposal within one year of the date of
such    34   termination pursuant to clause (i), then the Company shall
pay Parent promptly (but in no event later than three business days after the
entering into of such agreement referred to in clause (ii) above) the Fee,
which amount shall be payable in immediately available funds.   (b) In the
event that the Company shall fail to pay the Fee when due, the Company shall
reimburse Parent and the Purchaser for the costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by Parent and Purchaser (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this Section 8.03, together with interest on such
unpaid Fee, commencing on the date that the Fee became due, at a rate equal
to the prime rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., from time
to time, in The City of New York, as such bank\'s Base Rate.   (c) Except as
set forth in this Section 8.03, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such expenses, whether or not any transaction is consummated.   SECTION
8.04. Amendment. Subject to Section 6.03, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards
of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that, after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the
Company, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the

consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   SECTION 8.05. Waiver.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (i) extend the

hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of

thereby.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS    SECTION 9.01. Non-
Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and
warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other document

policy, the application of such term or provision to other persons
or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect

parties further agrees that in any proceeding seeking specific performance
such party will waive (a) the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b)
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond.   SECTION 9.10.
