creditor, shareholder or other third party.

receipts, sales, use, ad valorem, franchise, profits, license, withholding,
payroll, employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, value
added, property or windfall profits taxes, customs, duties or similar fees,
assessments or charges of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest and

governmental authority with respect to Taxes.

Environmental Laws in all material respects. The Company has not received any

holds all Permits and authorizations required under applicable Environmental
Laws, unless the failure to hold such Permits and authorizations would not

material respects. No releases of Hazardous Materials have occurred at, from,

Parent's reliance upon such exemption is predicated in part upon the Company's
and the Shareholders' representations herein and upon the representations

accurate copies of the original documents. The schedules, certificates, and
any and all other statements and information, whether furnished in written or
electronic form, to Parent or its representatives by or on behalf of any of
the Company or its Affiliates in connection with the negotiation of this

ARTICLE 4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

 

Parent represents and warrants to the Company, the Shareholders that, except
as set forth in Parent Disclosure Schedule:

 



 

4.1. Organization, Standing, Corporate Power and Quotation of Common Stock.
Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has
the requisite corporate power and authority and all government licenses,
authorizations, Permits, consents and approvals required to own, lease and
operate its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted. Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate)
would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent. Parent has
taken all steps required to qualify shares of common stock of Parent, par
value $0.001 (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), to become quoted on the OTCBB under
the corporate name and symbol described in Section 8.3(i), including filing of
Form 211, and submission of all materials required by the OTC Bulletin Board
for such quotation. If the Parent has no Subsidiaries, all other references to
the Subsidiaries or any of them in this Agreement, shall be disregarded.

 

4.2. Subsidiaries. The Subsidiaries of the Parent, and the authorized and
outstanding capital stock of each are set forth on _Schedule 4.2_. All of the
outstanding capital stock of the

of Parent Common Stock will be issued and outstanding, and no shares of Parent
Common Stock will be issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants,
convertible notes, options or otherwise (except as described below). All

all shares which may be issued pursuant to this Agreement will be, when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, not
subject to preemptive rights, and issued in compliance with all applicable
state and federal Laws concerning the issuance of securities. Except for the
Parent Common Stock, there are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness or other securities of Parent having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote).
There are no outstanding securities, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or other equity securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations, commitments, understandings or arrangements of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or make
any payment in respect of any shares of capital stock of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no agreements or arrangements pursuant to which the
Parent is or could be required to register shares of Parent Common Stock or
other securities under the Securities Act or other agreements or arrangements
with or among any security holders of the Parent with respect to securities of
the Parent.

 

4.4. Corporate Authority; Noncontravention. Parent has all requisite
corporate and other power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been (or at Closing will have been) duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent. This Agreement has been duly executed
and when delivered by Parent, shall constitute a valid and binding obligation
of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general
principles of equity. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not,
and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions
hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any breach or violation of, or
Default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of or "put" right with
respect to any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or Assets of Parent under,
(i) the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, or other charter documents of

arbitration award applicable to Parent, its properties or Assets, other than,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, breaches,
violations, Defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the
aggregate could not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or
could not prevent, hinder or materially delay the ability of Parent to
consummate the Transactions.

Government Authorization

 

. No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity, is required
by or with respect to Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of

4.6. SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Financial Statements

 

.

 

(a) Parent has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents as required
under the Exchange Act and Parent has delivered or made available to the
Company all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed
with the SEC (collectively, and in each case including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents. Except to the extent revised or superseded by a subsequent filing
with the SEC (a copy of which has been provided to the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement), none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
consolidated financial statements of Parent included in such Parent SEC
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
financial position of Parent as of the dates thereof and the results of
operations and changes in cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments as determined by Parent's independent accountants). Except as set
forth in the Parent SEC Documents, at the date of the most recent financial
statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents, Parent has not
incurred any liabilities or monetary obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), which, individually, or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

 

(b) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date

Parent and, has not granted or agreed to grant any option, warrant or other
right to subscribe for or to purchase any capital stock or any other security
of Parent or has incurred or agreed to incur any indebtedness for borrowed
money.

event which, if it had taken place following the execution of this Agreement,

disposition of any Assets) or any relinquishment by the Parent or any Contract
or other right, in either case, material to the Parent, other than
transactions and commitments in the ordinary course consistent with past
practices and those contemplated in this Agreement; or 

 

(l) agreement or commitment to do any of the foregoing.

Parent to consummate the Transactions, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or Order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding
against Parent having, or which, insofar as reasonably could be foreseen by
Parent, in the future could have, any such effect.

 

(b)

Parent is not a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement,
Contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor
organization, nor is it the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has
committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any
labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment nor is there any
strike, work stoppage or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to its
Knowledge, threatened, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Parent.

 

(c) The conduct of the business of Parent complies with all statutes, Laws,
regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, Orders, decrees or arbitration
awards applicable thereto.

 

4.10. Benefit Plans

 

. Parent is not a party to any Benefit Plan under which Parent currently has
an obligation to provide benefits to any current or former employee, officer
or director of Parent.

 

4.11. Tax Returns and Tax Payments

 

.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed with the appropriate
taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by it (taking into
account all applicable extensions). All such Tax Returns are true, correct
and complete in all respects. All Taxes due and owing by Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries has been paid (whether or not shown on any Tax Return and
whether or not any Tax Return was required). Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return or pay any Tax. No claim has ever been made in
writing or otherwise addressed to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by a
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Parent does not file Tax Returns that
it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The unpaid Taxes of
Parent did not, as of the Parent Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for
Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
financial statements (rather than in any notes thereto). Since the Parent
Balance Sheet Date, Parent has not incurred any liability for Taxes outside
the ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice. As
of the Closing Date, the unpaid Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries will not
exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the books and records of Parent.

 

(b) No material claim for unpaid Taxes has been made or become a Lien against
the property of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or is being asserted against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, no audit of any Tax Return of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is being conducted by a tax authority, and no extension of
the statute of limitations on the assessment of any Taxes has been granted by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and is currently in effect. Parent has
withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party.

 

4.12. Environmental Matters

 

. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all requisite
Environmental Laws in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice regarding any violation of any
Environmental Laws, including any investigatory, remedial or corrective
obligations, which, if determined adversely to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries
holds all Permits and authorizations required under applicable Environmental
Laws, unless the failure to hold such Permits and authorizations would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and is compliance with all terms,
conditions and provisions of all such Permits and authorizations in all
material respects. No releases of Hazardous Materials have occurred at, from,
in, to, on or under any real property currently or formerly owned, operated or
leased by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof and no
Hazardous Materials are present in, on, about or migrating to or from any such
property which could result in any liability to Parent or any of its

 _Ref. 09-1809-14-305_

 

 _ No. 158849_001_

 



 

Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has not transported or
arranged for the treatment, storage, handling, disposal, or transportation of
any Hazardous Material to any off-site location which could result in any
liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries has no liability, absolute or contingent, under any Environmental
Law that if enforced or collected would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no past, pending or threatened
claims under Environmental Laws against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and
each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is not aware of any facts or circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to result in a liability or claim against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Environmental Laws.

 

4.13. Material Contract Defaults

 

. The Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Parent for the year ended December
31, 2013 and the Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 29, 2014 list the
Parent's Material Contracts. Parent is not, or has not received any notice or
has any Knowledge that any other party is, in Material Contract Default under
any Parent Material Contract; and there has not occurred any event that with
the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute such a
Material Contract Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent
Material Contract_ " means any Contract that is effective as of the Closing
Date to which the Parent is a party (i) with expected receipts or expenditures
in excess of $5,000, (ii) requiring the Parent to indemnify any person, (iii)
granting exclusive rights to any party, (iv) evidencing indebtedness for
borrowed or loaned money in excess of $5,000, including guarantees of such
indebtedness, or under which a security interest has been imposed on any of
its Assets, tangible or intangible; (v) any agreement (or group of related
agreements) for the lease of real or personal property, including capital
leases; (vi) any licensing agreement, or any agreement forming a partnership,
strategic alliances, profit sharing or joint venture; (vii) any profit
sharing, deferred compensation, severance, or other material plan or
arrangement for the benefit of its current or former officers, directors and
managers or any of the Parent's employees; (viii) any employment or
independent contractor agreement providing post-termination or severance
payments or benefits or that cannot be cancelled without more than thirty (30)
days' notice; (ix) any agreement with any current or former officer, director,
shareholder, members, manager or affiliate of the Parent; (x) any agreements
relating to the acquisition (by merger, purchase of units or assets or
otherwise) by the Parent of any operating business or material assets or the
capital stock of any other person; (xi) any agreements for the sale of any of
the Assets of the Parent, other than in the ordinary course of business; (xii)
any outstanding agreements of guaranty, surety or indemnification, direct or
indirect, by the Parent; (xiii) any royalty agreements, licenses or other
agreements relating to Intellectual Property (excluding licenses pertaining to
"off-the-shelf" commercially available software used pursuant to shrink-wrap
or click-through license agreements on reasonable terms for a license fee of
no more than $5,000); and (xiv) any other agreement under which the
consequences of a default or termination could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent. 

 

4.14. Accounts Receivable

 

. All of the accounts receivable of Parent that are reflected in the Parent
SEC Documents or the accounting records of Parent as of the Closing
(collectively, the " _Parent Accounts Receivable_ ") represent or will
represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made or services
actually performed in the ordinary course of business and are not subject to
any defenses, counterclaims, or rights of set off other than those arising in
the ordinary course of business and for which adequate reserves have been
established. The Parent Accounts Receivable are fully collectible to the
extent not reserved for on the balance sheet on which they are shown.

 

4.15. Properties

 

. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has valid land use rights for all real
property that is material to its business and good, clear and marketable title
to all the tangible properties and tangible Assets reflected in the latest
balance sheet as being owned by Parent or acquired after the date thereof
which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent's business
(except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business), free and clear of

all Material Liens, encumbrances, claims, security interest, options and
restrictions of any nature whatsoever. Any real property and facilities held
under lease by Parent or its Subsidiaries are held by them under valid,
subsisting and enforceable leases of which each of Parent and its Subsidiaries
is in compliance, except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.16. Intellectual Property

 

. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries owns or has valid rights to use the
Trademarks, trade names, domain names, copyrights, patents, logos, licenses
and computer software programs (including, without limitation, the source
codes thereto) that are necessary for the conduct of its business as now being
conducted. All of Parent's and its Subsidiaries' licenses to use Software
programs are current and have been paid for the appropriate number of users.
To the Knowledge of Parent, none of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' Intellectual
Property infringe upon the rights of any third party that may give rise to a
cause of action or claim against Parent or each of its successors.

performance of the obligations of any other Shareholder party to this
Agreement (or, for the avoidance of doubt, the performance of the obligations
of the Company or the Parent under this Agreement). Nothing contained herein
and no Shareholder action taken by any Shareholder pursuant hereto, shall be
deemed to constitute such Shareholder as a party to or member of a
partnership, an association, a joint venture, or any other kind of entity, or
create a presumption that any Shareholder is in any way acting in concert or
as a group with any of the other parties hereto with respect to such
