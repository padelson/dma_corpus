SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
21st day of December, 2012, among AssuraMed, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), Invacare Corporation, an Ohio corporation ("Seller"), and Invacare
Supply Group, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company").

RECITALS:

A. Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company (as more particularly defined in Section 4.2, the "Shares").

B. Buyer shall purchase from Seller, and Seller shall sell to Buyer, the
Shares, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the "Share Purchase").

Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, Seller and the
Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

Definitions

1.1 Definitions. Certain terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings
set forth in Article 11, or elsewhere herein as indicated in Article 11.

1.2 Accounting Terms. Accounting terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them under
GAAP, except as may otherwise be specified herein.

ARTICLE 2

Purchase and Sale

2.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free
and clear of all Liens, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, all of Seller's
right, title and interest in and to the Shares.

2.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for
the Shares shall be an amount equal to:

(a) One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000);

(b) plus an amount equal to the Closing Cash;

(c) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Working Capital Target;

(d) minus an amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness; and 

(e) minus the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the
Closing Working Capital.

2.3 Estimated Purchase Price; Payment of Indebtedness. On the third (3rd)
Business Day before the Closing Date, the Company shall estimate in good faith
the amount of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing
Working Capital, respectively, as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date and
deliver to Buyer a certificate (the "Closing Certificate") setting forth such
estimates and the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price. The Closing
Certificate shall be subject to the reasonable review and comment by Buyer,
but if the Company does not agree with any comments provided by Buyer, the
positions on the Closing Certificate shall be used for purposes of calculating
the Estimated Purchase Price and Buyers may assert any of its objections in
accordance with Section 2.4. As used herein, "Estimated Closing Cash,"
"Estimated Closing Indebtedness" and "Estimated Closing Working Capital" mean
the estimates of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing
Working Capital, respectively, set forth in the Closing Certificate, and
"Estimated Purchase Price" means an amount equal to the Purchase Price
calculated as set forth in Section 2.2, assuming for purposes of such
calculation that the Closing Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, that
the Closing Indebtedness is equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and
that the Closing Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Closing Working
Capital. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Buyer shall: (a) pay and deliver the Estimated Purchase Price (as
calculated based upon the Closing Certificate) to Seller by means of a wire
transfer of immediately available cash funds to an account as directed by
Seller prior to the Closing (the "Seller's Account"); and (b) on behalf of the
Company, (i) pay the Indebtedness of the Company identified on Schedule
2.3(b)(i) (collectively, the "Repaid Closing Indebtedness"), and (ii) arrange
for the replacement of those surety bonds issued and outstanding as of the
Closing listed on Schedule 2.3(b)(ii).

2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) Adjustment Statement Preparation. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to Seller
an adjustment statement setting forth the amount of the Closing Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital, respectively, as of
11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement") and,
based on the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working
Capital, Buyer's written calculation of the Purchase Price, and the adjustment
necessary to reconcile the Estimated Purchase Price to the Purchase Price, if
any (the "Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment"). The Preliminary Adjustment
Statement and the Final Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with, and using the same accounting methods, policies, practices
and procedures as used in the preparation of, the Interim Financial Statements
(including the policies and procedures described on Schedule 4.5(a)), except
that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Final Adjustment Statement
shall only reflect those items necessary to calculate the Closing Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital. In preparing the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement: (i) any and all effects on the assets or
liabilities of the Company of any financing or refinancing arrangements
entered into by Buyer at any time on or after the Closing Date shall be
entirely disregarded; (ii) it shall be assumed that the Company and its lines
of business shall be continued as a going concern; and (iii) there shall not
be taken into account (A) any of the plans, 

transactions or changes that Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be
initiated or made after the Closing Date with respect to the Company or its
businesses or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or
particular to Buyer or any assets or liabilities of Buyer, or any obligation
for the payment of the Purchase Price hereunder or (B) any adjustments for
Buyer's use of purchase accounting.

(b) Adjustment Statement Review. Seller shall review the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment and, if
Seller believes that either was not prepared in accordance with Section
2.4(a), Seller shall so notify Buyer in writing no later than thirty (30) days
after Seller's receipt thereof, setting forth in such notice, Seller's
objection or objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement or the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with reasonable particularity of the
adjustments which Seller claims are required to be made thereto in order to
conform the same to the terms of Section 2.4(a). Buyer shall cause the Company
and its officers, employees, agents and representatives to cooperate with all
representatives of Seller in the review of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall cause
the books and records of the Company to be made available during normal
business hours to such representatives, and shall cause the necessary
personnel of the Company to assist such representatives in their review of the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement, including granting such persons access to
the facilities and other assets of the Company, in each case, upon reasonable
advance notice.

(c) Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution. If Seller timely notifies Buyer
in accordance with Section 2.4(b) of an objection to the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, then Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations
within fifteen (15) days after Seller's delivery of such written notice of
objection, then, the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to,
and the same shall be finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement by the Cleveland, Ohio office of Deloitte LLP, or if such firm
is unable to act in such capacity, an accounting firm of national reputation
mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "Independent Accountants"). Buyer
and Seller shall have the opportunity to present their positions with respect
to such disputed matters in writing to the Independent Accountants in
accordance with the requirements of Section 2.4. The Independent Accountants
shall determine and report in writing to Buyer and Seller as to the resolution
of all disputed matters submitted to the Independent Accountants and the
effect of such determinations on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment within twenty (20) days after such
submission or such longer period as the Independent Accountants may reasonably
require, and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as to
Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates. In resolving any disputed item,
the Independent Accountants shall: (i) be bound by the provisions of this
Article 2 and the definitions pertaining hereto; (ii) select either the
position of Buyer or Seller as a resolution for each item or amount disputed
and may not impose an alternative resolution with respect to any item or
amount disputed, and (iii) restrict its decision to such items which are then
in dispute. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Buyer and Seller a
written report setting forth the resolution of any disagreement determined in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accountants shall be borne by the party (i.e., Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand) that assigned an 

aggregate amount to items in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in
amount from the amount finally determined by the Independent Accountants.

(d) Final Adjustment Statement and Post-Closing Adjustment. The Preliminary
Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment shall become
the "Final Adjustment Statement" and the "Final Post-Closing Adjustment,"
respectively, and as such shall become final, binding and conclusive upon
Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates for all purposes of this
Agreement, upon the earliest to occur of the following:

(i) the mutual acceptance by Buyer and Seller of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, with such
changes or adjustments thereto, if any, as may be proposed by Seller and
consented to by Buyer;

(ii) the expiration of thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment,
respectively, without timely written objection thereto by Seller in accordance
with Section 2.4(b); or

(iii) the delivery to Buyer and Seller by the Independent Accountants of the
report of their determination of all disputed matters submitted to them
pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

(e) Adjustment of Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price, as finally determined
in accordance with Section 2.4(d), is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then Buyer shall pay the amount of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment to
Seller by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Seller's Account. If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance
with Section 2.4(d), is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller
shall pay the amount of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment to Buyer by means of
a wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer. The Final Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, shall be due and payable
pursuant to this Section 2.4(e) no later than two (2) Business Days after the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment
become the Final Adjustment Statement and the Final Post-Closing Adjustment,
respectively, pursuant to Section 2.4(d). For Tax purposes, any payment by
Buyer or Seller under this Agreement, including pursuant to Article 9, shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless another treatment is
required by Law.

Statements"), and as of and for the nine (9) month period ended September 30,
2012 and the ten (10) month period ended October 31, 2012 (collectively, the
"Interim Financial Statements," and together with the Annual Financial
Statements, 

the "Financial Statements") are attached to Schedule 4.5(a). The Financial
Statements (i) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, subject to the exceptions to GAAP set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)
(including any non-GAAP policies and procedures described therein), and (ii)
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of the date indicated and the results of operations for the period

Balance Sheet."

the Ordinary Course of Business or valid claims as to which full performance
has been rendered by the Company. There are no disputes with respect to any of
the accounts receivable reflected on the Acquisition Balance Sheet that have
not been reserved for in the Acquisition Balance Sheet. No counterclaims,
defenses or offsetting claims with respect to the accounts receivable of the

5.1 Organization; Authorization. Buyer is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its state of
incorporation. Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other agreement,
instrument and document to be executed and delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto
(collectively, the "Buyer Ancillary Agreements"), and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein and therein. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and
the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly and validly authorized by corporate action on the part of
Buyer.

5.2 Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. This Agreement has been, and each
Buyer Ancillary Agreement, will upon such delivery be, duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and constitutes, or will upon such delivery constitute, the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions.

5.3 Governmental Authorities; Consents.

(a) Except for the applicable requirements of the HSR Act (including the HSR
Filing), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Buyer
Ancillary Agreement, nor the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Buyer with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof, will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach by
Buyer of any provisions of the Charter Documents of Buyer; (ii) contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation of, or constitute a failure to comply
with, any Law or Order applicable to Buyer or by which any properties or
assets owned or used by Buyer is bound or affected; except, in the case of
clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(a), as would not materially impair the ability
of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Other than the applicable requirements of the HSR Act (including the HSR
Filing), no consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Person is required to be obtained or made by Buyer in
connection with: (i) the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreement in connection herewith; or (ii) the
compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof or thereof or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

5.4 Brokerage. No Person is or will become entitled, by reason of any
agreement or arrangement entered into or made by or on behalf of Buyer, to
receive any commission, brokerage, 

finder's fee or other similar compensation in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.5 Investment Intent; Restricted Securities. Buyer is acquiring the Shares
solely for Buyer's own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a
view to, or with any present intention of, reselling or otherwise distributing
the Shares or dividing its participation herein with others. Buyer has
sufficient experience in business, financial and investment matters to be able
to evaluate the purchase of the Shares and to make an informed investment
decision with respect to such purchase. Buyer is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501 promulgated under the 1933 Act. Buyer has had
such opportunity as it has deemed adequate to obtain from the management of
the Company such information about the business of the Company as is necessary
to permit Buyer to evaluate the merits and risks of investment in the Company.
Buyer understands and acknowledges that: (a) none of the Shares have been
registered or qualified under the 1933 Act, or under any securities Laws of
any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, in reliance upon
specific exemptions thereunder for transactions not involving any public
offering; (b) all of the Shares constitute "restricted securities" as defined
in Rule 144 under the 1933 Act; (c) none of the Shares are traded or tradable
on any securities exchange or over-the-counter; and (d) none of the Shares may
be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of unless a registration statement
under the 1933 Act with respect to such Shares and qualification in accordance
with any applicable state securities Laws becomes effective or unless such
registration and qualification is inapplicable, or an exemption therefrom is
available. Buyer will refrain from transferring or otherwise disposing of any
of the Shares acquired hereunder or any interest therein in any manner that
may cause Seller to be in violation of the 1933 Act or any applicable state
securities Laws.

5.6 Financing. Buyer has and will continue to have readily available funds
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each Buyer Ancillary Agreement.

5.7 Solvency. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer and the Company: (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair
value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its liabilities and that
the present saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount
required to pay its probable liabilities as they become absolute and matured),
(b) will have adequate capital with which to engage in its business, and (c)
will not have incurred and will not plan to incur liabilities beyond its
ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

5.8 Due Diligence Investigation. Buyer has had an opportunity to discuss the
business, management, operations and finances of the Company with its
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates, and
has had an opportunity to inspect the facilities of the Company. Buyer has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Company. In making its
decision to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely upon the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article 3 of this
Agreement and in the Seller Ancillary Agreements and of the Company and Seller
set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement and in the Company Ancillary
Agreements (and acknowledges that such representations and warranties are the
only representations and warranties made by Seller and the Company, as the
case may be) and has not relied upon any other information provided by, for or
on behalf of Seller or the Company, or their respective agents or
representatives, 

to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Buyer has entered into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
the understanding, acknowledgement and agreement that no representations or
warranties, express or implied, are made with respect to any projection or
forecast regarding future results or activities or the probable success or
profitability of the Company. Buyer acknowledges that no current or former

whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,

access shall not permit any representatives of Buyer to conduct any
environmental testing or sampling without the prior written consent of Seller,
and (ii) be furnished such additional financial, operating and other data and
information as Buyer may reasonably request and shall be kept generally
informed as to all material matters involving the operations and business of
the Company. Any inspection pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) will be conducted
in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the Company, and in no event will any provision hereof be
interpreted to require the Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose
any information that the Company determines in good faith may violate any Law,
any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality, or that would result
in the loss of an attorney-client or other privilege. Seller acknowledges that 

Buyer and its representatives will require contact with the employees, and may
require contact with landlords, customers or suppliers of the Company or other
third parties, including for purposes of planning Buyer's integration of the
Company's business into Buyer's business. Accordingly, Buyer and its
representatives will be afforded access to the premises and employees of the
Company during normal business hours to facilitate such integration, arranging
such access with the Company. Additionally, contacts with landlords, customers
or suppliers of the Company or other third parties with whom Buyer does not
currently have a relationship will be arranged by the Company upon the request
of Buyer, such contacts not to be unreasonably conditioned or delayed,
provided, that, the Company shall be entitled to have its representatives
participate in any or all such contacts where Buyer does not currently have a
relationship.

(c) Satisfaction of Closing Conditions; HSR.

(i) During the Pre-Closing Period and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Company and Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause to be done all
things necessary under the terms of this Agreement or under applicable Laws to
cause the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 6 and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to provide all notices to,
and to obtain all authorizations, consents, Permits, waivers or other
approvals of, all Persons that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement, and the parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to
each of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of this
sentence shall include the Company after the Closing) shall be required to pay
any amounts in connection with obtaining any such authorizations, consents,
Permits, waivers or other approvals.

(ii) Buyer and the Company agree to file a Notification and Report Form and
documentary materials in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice as soon as practicable,
and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof (the "HSR
Filing"). All filing fees payable with respect to such filing shall be paid by
Buyer. Buyer and the Company agree to promptly file any other report required
by any other Governmental Authority relating to antitrust matters, and to
promptly make any filings or submissions required under any applicable foreign
antitrust or trade regulation Law. Buyer and the Company shall request early
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable foreign antitrust or trade regulation Law. The Company and Buyer
shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission which is necessary under any other applicable antitrust
regulation. Each of the Company and Buyer shall promptly inform the other
party of any material communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in respect of the HSR Filing or any foreign 

antitrust or competition filing. Each of the Company and Buyer shall (a) use
its respective commercially reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as
possible with all requests of any Governmental Authority for additional
information and documents, including information or documents requested under
the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust regulation; (b) not (i) extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or any applicable antitrust regulation or
(ii) enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each
case, with the prior consent of the other parties; and (c) cooperate with the
other and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
action, including legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that no party shall be required to commence or defend any litigation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of this sentence includes the
Company) shall be required, in connection with the matters covered in this
Section 8.1(c), to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or sell,
divest or dispose of such assets or businesses of itself or the Company (or
otherwise take any action that limits the freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of its businesses, product lines, or assets or
those of the Company) as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent), which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:

(i) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller at any time prior to the
Closing;

(ii) by Buyer or Seller, upon notice to the other party, if a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an Order permanently enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and such Order has become final and non-appealable; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision
of this Agreement results in or causes such Order or who is not in compliance
with its obligations under Section 8.1(c)(i);

(iii) by (i) Buyer if it is not then in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and if (x) any of the representations and warranties of
Seller or the Company in this Agreement are or become untrue or inaccurate
such that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(c)(i) would not be satisfied
or (y) there has been a breach on the part of Seller or the Company of any of
their covenants or obligations in this Agreement such that the condition set
forth in Section 6.1(c)(ii) would not be 

satisfied and, in either case, such breach or inaccuracy is not waived or
cured within ten (10) days after being notified of the same or is incapable of
being cured; or (ii) Seller if neither the Company nor Seller are then in
material breach of their respective obligations under this Agreement and if
(x) any of the representations and warranties of Buyer in this Agreement are
or become untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section
6.2(c)(i) would not be satisfied or (y) there has been a breach on the part of
Buyer of any of its covenants or obligations in this Agreement such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(c)(ii) would not be satisfied and, in
either case, such breach or inaccuracy is not waived or cured within ten (10)
days after being notified of the same or is incapable of being cured;

(iv) by (i) Buyer if any of the conditions in Section 6.1 has not been
satisfied as of March 1, 2013 or if satisfaction of such a condition is or
becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement) and Buyer has not waived such condition; or
(ii) Seller if any of the conditions in Section 6.2 has not been satisfied as
of March 1, 2013 or if satisfaction of such a condition is or becomes
impossible (other than through the failure of Seller or the Company to comply
with their respective obligations under this Agreement) and Seller has not
waived such condition; or

(v) by Buyer or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred (other than through
the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply fully
with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before March 1, 2013.

Each party's right of termination hereunder is in addition to any other rights
it may have under this Agreement or otherwise and the exercise of a right of
termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to this Section 8.1(d), then all provisions of this
Agreement shall thereupon become void without any liability on the part of any
party hereto to any other party hereto except that (x) this Section 8.1(d) and
Sections 8.2(b), 8.2(d) and Article 12 shall survive any such termination and
(y) nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability for any breach
hereof occurring prior to such termination.

(e) Notice of Events; Updating of Disclosure Schedules. From time to time
prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Buyer with prompt notice of
(i) by way of a supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedules with
respect to such matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of
the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to this Agreement, the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event the occurrence or failure to occur of which
would be likely to cause any of its or Seller's representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate, (ii) any failure on
its or Seller's part to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it or Seller hereunder, and (iii) the occurrence
of any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in Article 6
impossible or unlikely; provided, that no such notice shall have any effect on
the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in Section 6.1(c) or
the remedies available to Buyer hereunder.

(f) Pre-Closing Publicity. During the Pre-Closing Period, any public
disclosures or announcements relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby will be made 

only as may be agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer, except as may be
required by Law or by any Governmental Authority or the rules of any stock
exchange or trading system. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any
disclosure or announcement required by Law or by any Governmental Authority or
the rules of any stock exchange or trading system, Seller may disclose the
financial and other material terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Purchase Price and the effect the transaction will
have on the earnings of Seller as a whole, if such disclosure is within the
conventions of disclosures made by publicly-traded companies for transactions
similar (on a relative basis) to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) Releases of Guarantees and Letters of Credit.

(i) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall cause (x) to be unconditionally
released, extinguished, replaced, assumed or cash-collateralized, in full the
guarantees or sureties (whether or not of Indebtedness) set forth on Schedule
2.3(c)(ii), together with any ancillary obligations thereto, issued by Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) on behalf of the Company,
without further recourse to Seller or its applicable Affiliate, and (y) Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Company) to be unconditionally released in
full from any liability or obligation in respect of any letter of credit
issued for the account of or in connection with any liability or obligation of
the Company, without further recourse to Seller or its applicable Affiliate.
Buyer and the Company shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any of the foregoing guarantees, sureties,
liabilities or obligations.

(ii) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall or shall cause (x) to be
unconditionally released, extinguished, replaced, assumed or cash-
collateralized, in full all guarantees or sureties (whether or not of
Indebtedness) other than those arising by operation of Law with respect to
Taxes, together with any ancillary obligations thereto, issued by the Company
on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates, without further recourse to the
Company, and (y) the Company to be unconditionally released in full from any
liability or obligation in respect of any letter of credit issued for the
account of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than letters of credit
issued for the account of the Company or in connection with any liability or
obligation of the Company), without further recourse to the Company. Seller
and its Affiliates shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any Losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any of the foregoing guarantees, sureties,
liabilities or obligations

(h) Settlement of Intercompany Payables. Prior to the Closing, all amounts
owed by the Company to any of its Affiliates or to the Company by any of its
Affiliates, including, in each case, Seller, shall be settled such that the
Company has no further liability with respect thereto or any adverse Tax
consequence with respect thereto.

(i) Consent Decrees or Orders. Prior to the Closing or the earlier termination
of this Agreement, Seller and the Company shall not enter into any consent
decree or other Order 

with any Governmental Authority that binds, restricts or otherwise adversely
affects the Company or the Company's business or assets (other than to the
extent any such decree or Order affects Seller's ability to sell certain
products to the Company). Seller shall not enter into any consent decree or
other Order with any Governmental Authority after the Closing with respect to
the publicly announced and currently pending Food and Drug Administration
investigation that would have the effects described in the immediately
preceding sentence.

8.2 Miscellaneous Covenants.

(a) Post-Closing Publicity. Following the Closing, no party shall issue any
press releases or public announcements setting forth the specific terms of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein without the prior
approval of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by Law or by any Governmental
Authority or the rules of any stock exchange or trading system or as may be
reasonably necessary to enforce any rights under this Agreement; provided,
that Buyer may issue a "tombstone" or similar advertisement without obtaining
such prior consent. Each party shall be entitled to disclose or comment to any
Person that a transaction has been consummated. In addition, nothing herein
shall preclude communications or disclosures reasonably necessary to implement
the provisions of this Agreement, and Buyer, Seller and their respective
Affiliates may make such disclosures as they may reasonably consider necessary
in order to satisfy their legal or contractual obligations to their lenders,
shareholders or investors, without the prior written consent of Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be.

(b) Expenses. Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses incident to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are incurred by Buyer or its
representatives or are otherwise expressly allocated to Buyer hereunder, and
Seller or the Company (with the Company only being obligated for payment of
any expenses of Seller and the Company if such payment is made prior to the
Closing or such expenses are accrued on the Final Adjustment Statement) shall
pay all fees and expenses incident to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which are incurred by Seller or the Company or their respective
representatives or are otherwise expressly allocated to Seller hereunder.

(c) No Assignments. No assignment or transfer of all or any part of this
Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder may be made by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of all other parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment or transfer without such consent shall be void and of no
force or effect; provided, that (a) Buyer may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer,
provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder; (b) Buyer may assign its rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement to any of its financing sources; and (c)
Buyer or (after the Closing) the Company may assign its rights or delegate any
of its duties to any purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets or
business of Buyer or the Company; provided, further, that no such assignment
shall relieve Buyer or the Company of its obligations hereunder.

(d) Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the execution of this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge that the confidentiality agreement relating
to confidential information of the Company executed by Buyer and Seller, dated
September 4, 2012 (the 

"Confidentiality Agreement"), remains in full force and effect pursuant to the
terms thereof, except to the extent reasonably necessary for Buyer to enforce
any of its rights under this Agreement, but shall terminate at the Closing.

(e) Access. Subject to any retention requirements relating to the preservation
of Tax records, Seller and Buyer shall (and Buyer shall cause the Company to),
for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, provide the other party and its
designees and representatives with such access to the books and records
relating to the Company as may be reasonably requested by Seller or Buyer
(including with respect to any capital markets transaction contemplated by
Buyer or its Affiliates), who shall be entitled, at its expense, to make
extracts and copies of such books and records. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees
that it shall not, during such five (5) year period, destroy or cause or
permit to be destroyed any such books or records without first obtaining the
consent of the other party (or providing to the other party notice of such
intent and a reasonable opportunity to copy such books or records, at the
other party's expense, at least thirty (30) days prior to such destruction).

(f) Continuation of Indemnification. For a period of six (6) years following
the Closing, Buyer agrees to cause the Company to indemnify and hold harmless
each of the present and former directors and officers of the Company, in their
capacities as such, from and against all damages, costs and expenses actually
incurred or suffered in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit
or proceeding at Law or in equity by any Person or any arbitration or
administrative or other proceeding relating to the business of the Company or
the status of such individual as a director or officer prior to the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted by the Charter Documents of the Company as
they exist on the date of this Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for
the Company\'s officers and directors in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer
that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage and have other
terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company or, in lieu of the foregoing, Seller may obtain such other
insurance product that has a comparable effect. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Company to maintain such policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder. This Section is intended to
benefit each director and officer who has held such capacity on or prior to
the Closing Date and is now or at any time during the six (6) year period
following the Closing Date entitled to indemnification or advancement of
expenses pursuant to any provisions contained in the Charter Documents as of
the date hereof.

(g) Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing, at the request of
any party hereto, each other party hereto shall execute and deliver any
further instruments and take such other action as such party may reasonably
request to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby.

(h) Invacare Name. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company
not to utilize the names or marks "Invacare," "ISG," or any variant thereof,
whether on signage, letterhead or otherwise, except in compliance with the
Transition Services Agreement. 

8.3 Acknowledgment. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Article 3 or
Article 4 (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules) hereof or in any Seller
Ancillary Agreement or Company Ancillary Agreement, Seller and the Company
expressly disclaim any representations or warranties of any kind or nature,
express or implied, as to the Shares or the condition, value or quality of the
Company or the Company\'s assets, and Seller and the Company specifically
disclaim any representation or warranty of merchantability, usage, suitability
or fitness for any particular purpose with respect to the Company\'s assets,
or as to the workmanship thereof, or the absence of any defects therein,
whether latent or patent, it being understood that such subject assets are
being acquired "as is, where is" on the Closing Date, and in their present
condition, and Buyer shall rely on its own examination and investigation
thereof and the representations and warranties of Seller in Article 3 and any
Seller Ancillary Agreement and of the Company in Article 4 and any Company
Ancillary Agreement. Except for the representations and warranties contained
in Article 3 and Article 4 (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules) hereof or
in any Seller Ancillary Agreement or Company Ancillary Agreement, Seller and
the Company hereby disclaim all liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, statement, or information made, communicated, or
furnished (orally or in writing) to Buyer or its Affiliates or representatives
(including, without limitation, those regarding cost estimates, projections or
other predictions, and information in any memorandum or offering materials or
presentations, that may have been or may be provided to Buyer by any director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant, or representative of the Company or any
of its Affiliates).

8.4 No Shop. Seller and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives
or agents of the Company (collectively, the "Representatives") to, directly or
indirectly, (i) negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend, propose
or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or
acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any material
amount of the assets of the Company or any capital stock or other ownership
interest in the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (ii) solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of
an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished to any
Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction, or (iv)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of
the foregoing. Seller shall notify Buyer orally and in writing promptly (but
in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by Seller or any of the
Representatives of any proposal or offer from any Person other than Buyer to
effect an Acquisition Transaction or any request for non-public information
relating to the Company by any Person other than Buyer. Seller and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Buyer) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction. Seller and the Company shall not release any third
party from the confidentiality provisions of any agreement to which Seller or
the Company is a party. 



8.5 Company Engagements; Privileged Information.

(a) Calfee, Halter and Griswold LLP ("Calfee") has acted as counsel for Seller
and the Company (collectively, the "Calfee Clients") in connection with this
Agreement (the "Sale Engagement") and in that connection Calfee has not acted
as counsel for any other Person, including Buyer. Upon the Closing, only the
Calfee Clients shall be considered clients of Calfee in the Sale Engagement.
All communications between the Calfee Clients and Calfee in the course of the
Sale Engagement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to Seller and not the Company. Accordingly, neither the Company nor
Buyer shall have access to any such communications, or to the files of Calfee
relating to the Sale Engagement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) Seller and Calfee shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Sale Engagement,
and neither the Company nor Buyer shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the
extent that files of Calfee in respect of the Sale Engagement constitute
property of a Calfee Client, only Seller shall hold such property rights, and
(iii) Calfee shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Company or Buyer by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Calfee and the Company or otherwise.

(b) Without the need for any consent or waiver by the Company or Buyer, Calfee
shall be permitted to represent Seller after the Closing in connection with
any matter, including anything related to the transactions contemplated herein
or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Calfee shall be permitted to
represent Seller, any of its agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of
them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute (including
litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Buyer, the Company
or any of their agents under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims for
indemnification and disputes involving employment or noncompetition or other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement.

(c) Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-
client relationship with Calfee, unless Calfee is specifically engaged in
writing the Company, to represent the Company after Closing and either such
engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to Seller, or Seller
consents in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of
the Company by Calfee after Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions
of this Section 8.5. For example, and not by way of limitation, even if Calfee
is representing the Company after Closing, Calfee shall be permitted
simultaneously to represent Seller in any matter, including any disagreement
or dispute relating thereto. Furthermore, Calfee shall be permitted to
withdraw from the representation of the Company in order to be able to
represent or continue so representing Seller, even if such withdrawal causes
the Company or Buyer additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel
"up to speed"), delay or other prejudice.

8.6 Release. Effective as of the Closing, Seller by and on behalf of itself,
and on behalf of its successors, assigns and Affiliates, voluntarily,
knowingly and irrevocably releases and forever discharges the Company and its
officers, directors, managers and employees from any and all actions, 

agreements, amounts, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities and obligations of
every kind, nature or description, known or unknown, arising or existing prior
to the Closing, except for any rights of Seller under this Agreement or any
Company Ancillary Agreement or Seller Ancillary Agreement.

ARTICLE 9

Indemnification

9.1 Indemnification of Buyer. From and after the Closing and subject to the
limitations contained herein, Seller shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless,
pay and reimburse Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
Affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees"),
from and against any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by (a) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties made by
Seller or the Company herein (the amount of Losses calculated in each case
without regard to any qualification with respect to materiality, material
adverse effect or similar qualification); (b) any breach or nonperformance of
any of the covenants made by Seller or the Company herein; (c) any
Indebtedness or Bonus Amounts not fully paid on the Closing Date or, with
respect to Indebtedness, not included in the computation of Purchase Price;
(d) (1) all Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and any Losses resulting from the nonpayment thereof; (2) all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, combined or unitary group of which the
Company is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local or foreign Law and any Losses resulting from the nonpayment thereof; or
(3) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company) imposed on the
Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law,
which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or before the
Closing Date; and (e) the items set forth on Schedule 9.1.

Buyer's right to indemnification under this Section 9.1 is not adversely
affected by whether or not the possibility of any Loss was disclosed to Seller
on the date of this Agreement or whether or not Seller could have reasonably
foreseen the possibility of the Buyer Indemnitees incurring such Loss. The
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company shall not be affected
or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of Buyer
(including by any of Buyer's representatives) or by reason of the fact that
Buyer or any of its representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is or might be inaccurate.

9.2 Indemnification of Seller. From and after the Closing and subject to the
limitations contained herein, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless,
pay and reimburse Seller and its officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
Affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees"),
from and against any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties, or
breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants, made by Buyer herein. Buyer
does not make and shall not be deemed to have made, nor is Seller relying
upon, any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, other than those
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations that are expressly set
forth in this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreement. 

9.3 Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the indemnification obligations provided for in this Agreement
shall be subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Section
9.3.

(a) Any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1(a) shall be required to be made by delivering notice to Seller no later
than the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except (i) any
claim for indemnification based upon, arising out of or caused by any

Section 3.3 Execution and Delivery; Enforceability, Section 4.1 Organization
and Good Standing; Authority; Enforceability, Section 4.2 Capital Stock of the

Representations") may be made no later than the seven (7) year anniversary of
the Closing Date; and (ii) any claim for indemnification based upon, arising
out of or caused by any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in Section 4.7 Taxes may be made no later than the date that is

Section 8.1 Pre-Closing Covenants and Agreements shall be required to be made
by delivering notice to Seller no later than the twelve (12) month anniversary
of the Closing Date; and (iv) all covenants and agreements that contemplate
performance thereof following the Closing Date will survive the Closing Date
in accordance with their respective terms. Any claim pending on any of the
foregoing expiration dates for which a notice of claim has been given on or
before such expiration date may continue to be asserted until finally
resolved.

(b) Except for claims for indemnification with respect to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Fundamental Representation or any representation or warranty
contained in Section 4.7 Taxes, (i) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising under Section 9.1(a) until
the aggregate amount of all of the Buyer Indemnitees' claims for
indemnification exceeds the Indemnification Threshold and thereafter the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for all of the Buyer
Indemnitees' claims for indemnification without regard to the Indemnification
Threshold, and (ii) no Buyer Indemnitee may make a claim for any Losses
arising under Section 9.1(a) other than such Losses in excess of Fifteen
Thousand Dollars ($15,000) which result from a single claim or series of
related claims that arise out of the same facts, events or circumstances,
provided that all Losses, regardless of amount, shall be included in
calculating the aggregate amount of Losses for purposes of determining whether
the Indemnification Threshold has been exceeded.

(c) Except for claims for indemnification with respect to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Fundamental Representation or any representation or warranty
contained in Section 4.7 Taxes, the maximum aggregate indemnification amount
to which the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled under Section 9.1(a) shall be
the Indemnification Cap. The maximum aggregate indemnification amount to which
the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled under this Agreement for inaccuracy in
or breach of the Fundamental Representations or any representation or warranty
contained in Section 4.7 Taxes shall be the Purchase Price. 

(d) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement if, and to the extent that, the Losses are reflected on the Final
Adjustment Statement and the Buyer Indemnitees have been compensated therefor.

(e) The Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees shall, to the extent
required by Law, take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss
subject to Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, as the case may be, upon becoming aware
of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does give rise thereto.

(f) The Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue viable claims under available insurance policies
to recover, reduce, mitigate or offset any Loss indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, as the case may be; provided, however, that (i)
this sentence shall not require any party hereto to initiate or pursue
litigation in respect of such Loss or to pursue insurance policies prior to
seeking indemnification under this Article 9, and (ii) the Buyer Indemnitees
shall only be required to pursue available insurance policies purchased by the
Company prior to the Closing Date.

9.4 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) Third-Party Claims. In order for a party (the "indemnitee") to be entitled
to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement with respect to,
arising out of, or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the
indemnitee (a "Third-Party Claim"), such indemnitee must notify the party from
whom indemnification hereunder is sought (the "indemnitor") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim no later than thirty (30) days after such claim or demand is
first asserted. Such notice shall state in reasonable detail the amount or
estimated amount of such claim, and shall identify the specific basis (or
bases) for such claim, including the representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations in this Agreement alleged to have been breached. Failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder,
except and only to the extent the indemnitor shall have been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnitee shall
deliver to the indemnitor, without undue delay, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers received by the indemnitee) relating to the
Third-Party Claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on the attorney-client or any other
privilege that may be available to the indemnitee in connection therewith.

The indemnitor has the right to elect to assume and control the defense of a
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnitor by providing written
notice thereof to the indemnitee within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
notice of such Third-Party Claim from the indemnitee; provided, however, that
(i) defense of such Third-Party Claim by the indemnitor does not, in the
reasonable judgment of the indemnitee, have a material adverse effect on the
indemnitee; (ii) the indemnitor expressly agrees in writing to be fully
responsible for all Losses relating to such Third-Party Claim and (iii) such
Third-Party Claim solely seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages and
not include criminal charges (the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
are, collectively, the "Litigation Conditions"). If the indemnitor assumes
such defense, the indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the indemnitor, it being understood that the indemnitor
shall control such defense and that the indemnitor will not be liable for any
legal expenses subsequently 

incurred by the indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third-Party
Claim; provided, however, that if (x) any of the Litigation Conditions ceases
to be met or (y) the indemnitor fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend diligently such Third-Party Claim, the indemnitee may assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, and the indemnitor will be liable for all
expenses paid or incurred in connection with such defense (subject to the
limitations in this Article 9). If the indemnitor does not assume the defense
of any Third-Party Claim, the indemnitee may continue to defend such claim and
the indemnitor may still participate in, but not control, the defense of such
Third-Party Claim at the indemnitor's sole cost and expense. If the indemnitor
so assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the indemnitee shall
reasonably cooperate with the indemnitor in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include, at the expense of the indemnitor, the
retention and (upon the indemnitor's request) the provision to the indemnitor
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

The indemnitee (A) may settle, compromise or discharge in good faith any
Third-Party Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed or is no longer
being conducted by the indemnitor, without the indemnitor's prior written
consent; and (B) shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third-Party Claim that the indemnitor may recommend and that satisfies the
criteria set forth in the following sentence. The indemnitor shall not,
without the written consent of the indemnitee, enter into any settlement,
compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of any judgment that may be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business of
indemnitee or that imposes any obligation or restriction upon the indemnitee
(including with respect to any injunctive or equitable relief) or does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to such indemnitee of a release from all liability with respect to
such Third-Party Claim. The indemnitor may settle, compromise or discharge in
good faith any Third-Party Claim, the defense of which has been assumed by it,
without the indemnitee's prior written consent so long as such settlement,
compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of any judgment would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business of
indemnitee or would not impose any obligation or restriction upon the
indemnitee (including with respect to any injunctive or equitable relief) and
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to such indemnitee of a release from all liability with respect to
such Third-Party Claim

(b) Other Claims. In the event any indemnitee should have a claim against any
indemnitor under this Agreement that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim to the indemnitor promptly
following discovery of any indemnifiable Loss, but in any event, in the case
of the Buyer Indemnitees, not later than the last date set forth in Section
9.3(a) for making such claim. Failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnitor shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Such notice shall state in reasonable detail the amount or an estimated amount
of such claim, and shall specify the facts and circumstances which form the
basis (or bases) for such claim, and shall further specify the
representations, warranties or covenants alleged to have been breached. Upon
receipt of any such notice, the indemnitor shall notify the indemnitee as to
whether the indemnitor accepts liability for any Loss. If the indemnitor
disputes 

its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the indemnitor
and the indemnitee shall attempt to resolve such dispute in accordance with
the terms and provisions of Section 12.4.

(c) Tax Matters. The provisions of Section 9.4(a) and 9.4(b) shall not apply
to Tax Matters, which shall be governed by Section 10.3.

9.5 Limitation of Remedies. Each party acknowledges and agrees that, should
the Closing occur, the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article 9\. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller hereby waives on behalf of itself all other Persons who might claim by,
through or under him, her or it, from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud or intentional misrepresentation) that any such other
Person may have arising under or based upon any Law and that relates to the
transactions contemplated herein or to any aspect of the business of the
Company (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article 9). Nothing in this Section 9.5 shall limit any Person's right to seek
and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person may be entitled.

9.6 Contribution and Waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no Seller Indemnitee may seek indemnification or
contribution from the Company for any breaches of or in respect of any other
payments required to be made by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the
Seller Ancillary Agreements.

ARTICLE 10

Tax Matters

10.1 Apportionment of Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of
Tax with respect to the income, property or operations of the Company that is
attributable to any Tax period that begins on or before the Closing Date and
ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") will be apportioned between
the period of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and the period of the
Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the end of
the Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period") in accordance with
this Section 10.1. The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period will (a) in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use
taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle
Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-
added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or
measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended
on and included the Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle
Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a
Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by
income, on the other hand, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing 

Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period will be determined based
on the foregoing and based on the manner in which the actual Tax liability for
the entire Straddle Period is determined. In the case of a Tax that is (i)
paid for the privilege of doing business during a period (a "Privilege
Period") and (ii) computed based on business activity occurring during an
accounting period ending prior to such Privilege Period, any reference to a
"Tax period," a "tax period," or a "taxable period" shall mean such accounting
period and not such Privilege Period.

10.2 Tax Returns; Refunds.

(a) Seller shall provide Buyer with drafts of pro forma Tax Returns relating
solely to the Company (each, a "Pro Forma Tax Return") that relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date for review and comment
at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of each Tax
Return of Seller to which each such Pro Forma Tax Return relates, including
extensions, or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the timely
filing of such Tax Return. Not later than fifteen (15) days after Seller has
provided such Pro Forma Tax Return, or such shorter period as is necessary to
allow for the timely filing of the Tax Return of Seller to which the Pro Forma
Tax Return relates, Buyer shall notify Seller of the existence of any
objection, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such
objection that Buyer may have to any item set forth on such draft Pro Forma
Tax Return. Buyer (on behalf of itself, and following the Closing, the
Company) and Seller agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such
objection. To the extent that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such
objection, the parties shall refer such objection to the Independent
Accountants for resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.4(c). Except as otherwise required by Law, all Pro Forma Tax Returns
of the Company that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or before
the Closing Date shall be prepared consistent with past practices.

(b) Buyer shall cause the Company to provide Seller with drafts of all Tax
Returns of the Company that relate to any Straddle Period allocable or
apportioned to Seller pursuant to Section 10.1 for review and comment at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of each such Tax Return,
including extensions, or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the
timely filing of such Tax Return. Not later than fifteen (15) days after the
Company has provided such Tax Return, or such shorter period as is necessary
to allow for the timely filing of such Tax Return, Seller shall notify the
Company of the existence of any objection, specifying in reasonable detail the
nature and basis of such objection that Seller may have to any item set forth
on such draft Tax Return. Buyer (on behalf of itself, and following the
Closing, the Company) and Seller agree to consult and resolve in good faith
any such objection. To the extent that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve
any such objection, the parties shall refer such objection to the Independent
Accountants for resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.4(c). Except as otherwise required by Law, all Tax Returns of the
Company that relate to any Straddle Period allocable or apportioned to Seller
shall be prepared consistent with past practices and, for the avoidance of
doubt, will provide for a refund, in cash, in accordance with Section 10.2(d),
whenever possible for the overpayment of Taxes or otherwise, rather than a
credit for Taxes due for any Post-Closing Tax Period. 

(c) Except as otherwise required by Law or a Taxing Authority, without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), none of Buyer, the Company, or any
Affiliate thereof shall, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period file any
amended Tax Return.

(d) If the Company receives a Tax refund for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such
refund (net of any expenses or costs, including Taxes, incurred in seeking or
obtaining such refund) shall be paid to Seller; provided, however, that Seller
shall not be entitled to any refund either (i) reflected in the Closing
Working Capital, or (ii) attributable to any carryback of an item from a Post-
Closing Tax Period.

10.3 Controversies. Buyer shall cause the Company to notify Seller in writing
within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Company of any notice of any
inquiries, assessments, proceedings or similar events received from any Taxing
Authority with respect to Taxes of the Company for which Seller may be
required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement (any
such inquiry, assessment, proceeding, litigation, audit or similar event, a
"Tax Matter"). Seller may, at its own expense, participate in any Tax Matter
and, upon notice to Buyer, assume the defense of any Tax Matter that relates
solely to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. If Seller assumes such defense, Seller
shall have the authority, with respect to any Tax Matter, to represent the
interests of the Company before the relevant Taxing Authority and have the
right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax
Matter subject to the limitations contained herein, including responding to
inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, such Tax Matter. Buyer has the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Seller. Seller shall not
enter into any settlement of, or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter
without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Seller shall keep Buyer
informed with respect to the commencement, status, and nature of any such Tax
Matter, and will, in good faith, allow Buyer to consult with it regarding the
conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding. If Seller does not
assume the defense of such Tax Matter, Buyer shall keep Seller informed of the
progress of such Tax Matter from time to time and shall consult with Seller
with respect to such Tax Matter. Seller shall have the right (but not the
duty) to participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel,
at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Company. The Company
shall not have the right to settle (or to consent to the settlement or
compromise of) such Tax Matter without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if
such settlement or compromise would cause Seller to be liable for actual
payment of a majority of the settlement amount to be paid with respect to such
Tax Matter.

10.4 Cooperation. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed on the Company for all Tax periods, Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other,
including, without limitation, the furnishing or making available during
normal business hours of records, information, personnel (as reasonably
required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials reasonably
relevant or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, 

the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing
Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax Authorities. Seller agrees
to (A) retain all books and records with respect to income, franchise and
payroll Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations and any extension thereof for the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority, and (B) to give Buyer reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
Buyer so requests, Seller shall allow Buyer to take possession of such books
and records. Buyer agrees to (A) retain all books and records with respect to
all Tax matters (other than income, franchise and payroll Taxes) pertinent to
the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and any
extension thereof for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (B) to
give Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if Seller so requests, Buyer shall
allow Seller to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller
shall, upon request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

10.5 Consolidated Return Election. Seller shall make or cause to be made (and
shall refrain from making or causing to be made, as applicable) Tax elections
(including on a protective basis) so that the Company shall not suffer any
reduction in tax basis or other attributes pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-3.

10.6 Conflict. To the extent there is any conflict between the provisions of
this Article 10 and Article 9, the provisions of this Article 10 shall
control.

10.7 Successors. For purposes of this Article 10, references to any of the
Company, Seller, or Buyer shall include successor entities.
