This Voting and Support Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July

_Omnicom_ "), and each of the persons listed on _Annex I_ (each, a "
_Shareholder_ " and, collectively, the " _Shareholders_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in
the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _BCA_
"), by and between Omnicom and Publicis Groupe S.A., a French societe anonyme
(" _Publicis_ ").

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Omnicom and Publicis are entering into the BCA, which provides, among other
things, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
BCA: (a) Publicis and Holdco shall adopt the Cross-Border Merger Terms (the "
_Cross-Border Merger Terms_ ") for the merger between Publicis and Holdco (the
" _Publicis Merger_ ") in accordance with Directive 2005/56/EC of 26 October
2005 on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, pursuant
to which each issued and outstanding share, par value â‚¬0.40 per share, of
Publicis (the " _Publicis Shares_ ") shall be exchanged for 1.000000 Holdco
Share; and (b) immediately following consummation of the Publicis Merger,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into Omnicom (the " _Omnicom Merger_ " and,
together with the Publicis Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), with Omnicom surviving
the Omnicom Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, pursuant to which
each share of common stock, par value $0.15 per share, of Omnicom shall be
converted into the right to receive the Omnicom Exchange Ratio of a Holdco
Share;

  

WHEREAS, Omnicom and the Shareholders are executing this Agreement
concurrently with the execution of the BCA;

  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Shareholder is the owner, of record or
beneficially, of the number of Publicis Shares (with the corresponding voting
percentage) set forth opposite his or her name on _Annex I_ (the " _Existing
Shares_ " and, together with any Publicis Shares of which a Shareholder
acquires record or beneficial ownership during the period from the date hereof
until the Expiration Date, whether by purchase, dividend or distribution,
stock split or other recapitalization, issuance upon the exercise of any
equity awards or warrants, conversion of any convertible securities or
otherwise, but excluding any Publicis equity awards for so long as such
Publicis equity awards remain unexercised, the " _Subject Shares_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Shareholders have expressed their personal support to the
entering into the BCA and the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the BCA which, according to their judgment, are
in the best interest of Publicis;

  

WHEREAS, the Omnicom Board has, for purposes of Section 912 of the NYBCL,

permitted by applicable law), inapplicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby;
