                           SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES

     1.1    SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, on the Closing Date each Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from
each Seller, the Shares held by such Seller as set forth next to such Seller's
name on Annex A hereto. The purchase and sale of such Shares pursuant to this

A hereto (the "FRENCH SHARES"). Although Purchaser desires to purchase the
French Shares, IFS does not propose to transfer the French Shares pursuant to

unless and until the consultation process provided by the relevant French
legislation has been complied with in respect of the Council of Workers in place

PROCESS"). Without prejudice to the foregoing, (i) Sellers agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Works Council Consultation
Process, and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with such efforts, and (ii)
Purchaser and Sellers agree to negotiate in good faith with respect to the
purchase and sale of the French Shares on the basis of the terms and conditions
set forth herein at an initial purchase price of Thirteen Million Dollars
($13,000,000) (the "INITIAL FRENCH PURCHASE PRICE"). The parties agree that
following completion of the Works Council Consultation Process and negotiation
of the terms of the purchase and sale of the French Shares the parties will
enter into an addendum to this Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit 1
hereto (the "FRENCH ADDENDUM"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until
the French Addendum has been executed and delivered, (i) the term "Companies"
shall not be deemed to include the Excluded French Company for any of the
purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) in the event that the Closing of the
purchase and sale of the Shares (other than the French Shares) occurs prior to
the purchase of the French Shares, upon closing of the purchase and sale of the
French Shares pursuant to the French Addendum, the Initial French Purchase Price
shall be adjusted to give effect to the adjustments contemplated in Section 2.1
and Section 2.2 with respect to the Excluded French Company.

                           PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT

     2.1    PURCHASE PRICE.

            2.1.1    The unadjusted purchase price for the Shares (the "INITIAL
PURCHASE PRICE") shall be an amount equal to the sum of Eight Hundred Fifty Four
Million Seven Hundred Seventy Thousand Dollars ($854,770,000) plus the Estimated
External Cash/Debt Balance, less the Estimated Netting Tax Amount. The Initial
Purchase Price is subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 2.2, 2.5, 3.1(iv)
and 6.17 (as adjusted, the "FINAL PURCHASE PRICE"). The Initial Purchase Price
and the Final Purchase Price shall be payable as provided in Section 2.3. All
amounts set forth in this Agreement shall be in United States Dollars, unless
otherwise stated.

            2.1.2    Sellers shall provide written notice of the Estimated
External Cash/Debt Balance to Purchaser at least five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date.

            2.1.3    Sellers shall provide written notice of the Estimated Final
Intercompany Payables and the Estimated Final Intercompany Receivables to
Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date. The parties agree
and acknowledge that written notice of the Estimated Final Intercompany Payables
and Estimated Final Intercompany Receivables shall be set forth in sufficient
detail to permit Purchaser to determine Estimated Netting Tax Amount as set
forth in the following sentence. Based on the Estimated Final Intercompany
Payables and Estimated Final Intercompany Receivables, Purchaser shall estimate
the amount of Taxes in respect of periods other than Pre-Closing Tax Periods to
be paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including each Company and Subsidiary)
in connection with netting Final Intercompany Receivables and Final Intercompany
Payables pursuant to Section 2.2.2.3 of this Agreement (e.g., as a result of the
deemed distribution of cash or deemed distribution of Intercompany Receivables
from any Company or Subsidiary to Purchaser or its Affiliates, including each
Company and Subsidiary) and provide Sellers with written notice of such estimate
(the "Estimated Netting Tax Amount") at least two (2) days prior to the Closing
Date.

     2.2    ADJUSTMENT OF INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE.

            2.2.1    Final Trade Working Capital, Final External Cash/Debt
Balance, Final Intercompany Payables, Final Intercompany Receivables and Final
Netting Tax Amount shall be determined as set forth in this Section 2.2.1.

                   2.2.1.1  Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers,
within thirty (30) days after the Closing, the Closing Management Accounts,
which shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

                   2.2.1.2  Purchaser also shall prepare and deliver to Sellers,
within forty-five (45) days after the Closing, a post-Closing purchase price
adjustment statement (the "ADJUSTMENT STATEMENT") detailing Purchaser's
determination of: (i) Final Trade Working Capital, (ii) Final External Cash/Debt
Balance, (iii) Final Intercompany Payables and Final Intercompany Receivables
and (iv) Final Netting Tax Amount. The Adjustment Statement shall be prepared
based upon the Closing Management Accounts, adjusted as necessary in accordance
with the Accounting Principles, and including, but not limited to, the following
adjustments:

                            2.2.1.2.1  the Final External Cash/Debt Balance
shall be calculated converting the cash/debt balances of each Company or
Subsidiary, in respect of which the management accounts are not expressed in
U.S. dollars, into U.S. dollars at the closing mid-point U.S. dollar spot rate
shown in the Financial Times published on the first Business Day following
Closing; and

                            2.2.1.2.2  the Final Intercompany Payables and Final
Intercompany Receivables and Final Netting Tax Amount in respect of each Company
or Subsidiary, the management accounts of which are not expressed in U.S.
dollars, shall be converted into U.S. dollars at the closing mid-point U.S.
dollar spot rate shown in the Financial Times published on the first Business
Day following Closing.

                                        3
<Page>

            Any adjustments to the Closing Management Accounts other than those
described above shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be applied in a mutually
consistent manner to the calculation of: (i) the Final External Cash/Debt
Balance and (ii) Final Trade Working Capital. Prior to the delivery to Sellers
of the Closing Management Accounts and the Adjustment Statement, Sellers shall
give Purchaser and its accountants and other appropriate personnel such
assistance and access to the assets and books and records of Sellers and their
Affiliates (to the extent relevant to the preparation of the Closing Management
Accounts) as Purchaser or its accountants or other personnel may reasonably
request during normal business hours in order to enable Purchaser to prepare the
Closing Management Accounts and the Adjustment Statement. The Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to the Sellers all such workpapers and other data used in the
preparation of the Closing Management Accounts as may reasonably be requested by
the Sellers.

                   2.2.1.3  The Adjustment Statement shall be final and binding
on Purchaser and Sellers unless Sellers shall, within forty-five (45) days
following the delivery of the Adjustment Statement, deliver to Purchaser written
notice of objection (the "OBJECTION NOTICE") with respect to the Adjustment
Statement. The Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the disputed
items on the Adjustment Statement and describe in reasonable detail the basis
for the disputed items.

                   2.2.1.4  If the Objection Notice is delivered, the parties
shall consult with each other with respect to the disputed items and attempt in
good faith to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to reach agreement
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Objection Notice, either Purchaser
or Sellers may refer any unresolved disputed items to an accounting firm of
national reputation selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Sellers, or if
Purchaser and Sellers are unable to so agree, to Deloitte & Touche LLP (the
"UNRELATED ACCOUNTING FIRM"). The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be directed to
render a written report as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within
thirty (30) days on the unresolved disputed items and to resolve only those
issues of dispute set forth in the Objection Notice. The Unrelated Accounting
Firm shall resolve such issues of dispute in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. The resolution of the dispute by the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall
be final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the Unrelated
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Sellers and Purchaser.

            2.2.2    In order to determine the Final Purchase Price, the Initial
Purchase Price shall be adjusted in respect of (i) the Final Trade Working
Capital, (ii) the Final External Cash/Debt Balance, (iii) the Final Net
Intercompany Amount, and (iv) the Final Netting Tax Amount as set forth in this
Section 2.2.2:

                   2.2.2.1  FINAL TRADE WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

                            2.2.2.1.1  If the amount of Final Trade Working
Capital determined in accordance with Section 2.2.1 is less than the Baseline
Trade Working Capital, the Initial Purchase Price shall be decreased by an
amount equal to such deficit.

                            2.2.2.1.2  If the amount of the Final Trade Working
Capital is greater than the Baseline Trade Working Capital, the Initial Purchase
Price shall be increased by

                                        4
<Page>

an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such excess or (ii) Twelve Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12.5 million).

                   2.2.2.2  FINAL EXTERNAL CASH/DEBT BALANCE ADJUSTMENT.

                            2.2.2.2.1  If the amount of the Final External
Cash/Debt Balance determined in accordance with Section 2.2.1 is less than the
Estimated External Cash/Debt Balance, the Initial Purchase Price shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the difference.

                            2.2.2.2.2  If the amount of the Final External
Cash/Debt Balance determined in accordance with Section 2.2.1 is greater than
the Estimated External Cash/Debt Balance, the Initial Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the difference.

                   2.2.2.3  Final Intercompany Amount Adjustment. Final
Intercompany Receivables and Final Intercompany Payables shall be netted as of
the Closing, and the resulting amount shall be referred to herein as the "Final
Net Intercompany Amount." If the Final Net Intercompany Amount is a payable (ie,
such netting results in a payable owing by the Company and the Subsidiaries to
Invensys and its Affiliates other than the Company and the Subsidiaries), it
shall be deducted from the Initial Purchase Price and such amount shall be paid
at Closing by Purchaser in satisfaction of such payable. If the Final Net
Intercompany Amount is a receivable (ie, such netting results in a payable owing
by Invensys or its Affiliates, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
the Company and Subsidiaries), it shall be added to the Initial Purchase Price
and such amount shall be paid at Closing by Seller in satisfaction of such
receivable. The parties acknowledge that the netting of Final Intercompany
Receivables and Final Intercompany Payables, the payment of the Final Net
Intercompany Amount (whether a payable or a receivable), and the resulting
adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price, will always be non-cash adjustments,
and, by means of the process referred to in this Section 2.2.2.3, as of the
Closing, the Final Intercompany Payables and Final Intercompany Receivables
shall be extinguished and released.

                   2.2.2.4  FINAL NETTING TAX AMOUNT.

                            2.2.2.4.1  if the Final Netting Tax Amount
determined in accordance with Section 2.2.1 is less than the Estimated Netting
Tax Amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to
the difference.

                            2.2.2.4.2  if the Final Netting Tax Amount
determined in accordance with Section 2.2.1 is greater than the Estimated
Netting Tax Amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount
equal to the difference.

     2.3    PAYMENT OF INITIAL AND FINAL PURCHASE PRICE.

            2.3.1    At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Invensys (as agent
for Sellers) an amount equal to the Initial Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Invensys in
writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

                                        5
<Page>

            2.3.2    Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
Final Trade Working Capital, Final External Cash/Debt Balance and the Final
Netting Tax Amount in accordance with Sections 2.2.2.1, 2.2.2.2 and 2.2.2.4
Invensys (as agent for Sellers) shall pay to Purchaser, or Purchaser shall pay
to Invensys (as agents for Sellers), as the case may be, the net amount of any
adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price required pursuant to such Sections (the
"ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT").

            2.3.3    Payment of the Adjustment Amount shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a single account designated in
writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to such payment by Invensys or
Purchaser, as the case may be, and shall be accompanied by a payment of interest
determined by computing simple interest on the sum of the adjustments determined
pursuant to Section 2.2.2.1 and Section 2.2.2.2, from the Closing Date to the
date of payment(s), at the rate of interest announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase
Bank from time to time as its "reference rate" (on the basis of a 360-day year)
("Applicable Rate").

     2.4    ALLOCATION OF FINAL PURCHASE PRICE.

            2.4.1    Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate the Initial
Purchase Price as adjusted for any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.1(iv)
among the Companies at or prior to the Closing, including allocating a portion
of the Initial Purchase Price to the Excluded French Company if the French
Shares are transferred at the Closing. Within thirty (30) days following the
determination of the Adjustment Amount, or the determination that any adjustment
must be made pursuant to Section 2.5 or 6.17, Sellers and Purchaser shall agree
upon a revised purchase price allocation to reflect the Adjustment Amount and/or
any adjustment which must be made pursuant to Section 2.5 or 6.17 in accordance
with the character of each such adjustment and in a manner that is consistent
with the allocation of the Initial Purchase Price.

            2.4.2    Neither Sellers, Purchaser nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall file any Tax Return or other document or otherwise take, or
agree to take, any position on any Tax Return which is inconsistent with the
allocation determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, unless otherwise required by
Law.

     2.5    ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. In addition
to the purchase price adjustments described in Section 2.2, the Initial Purchase
Price shall be adjusted as follows:

            2.5.1    The parties acknowledge that if the Retiree Welfare Benefit
Modification is implemented on the Closing Date effective January 1, 2003 as
provided in Section 6.3.10, the Companies will achieve the reduction in the
projected accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as defined in
FASB No. 106 ("APBO") as calculated according to the assumptions and methodology
set forth on Schedule 6.3.10 as of December 31, 2002 of $34,600,000 (the
"ANTICIPATED SAVINGS"). To the extent that the Sellers have not taken all
necessary actions to implement the Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification
described on Schedule 6.3.10 on the Closing Date, effective January 1, 2003, the
Purchase Price will be reduced, on the Closing Date, by an amount which is equal
to sixty and seven tenths percent (60.7%) of the Anticipated Savings not
achieved by the Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification. For purposes of

                                        6
<Page>

calculating the adjustment in the Initial Purchase Price actually paid on the
Closing Date, the Anticipated Savings not achieved shall be calculated in good
faith by an actuary selected by Purchaser ( the "Closing Date Calculation").
Thereafter the Anticipated Savings not achieved shall be calculated pursuant to
the methodology set forth in Section 6.3.10 (the "Final Calculation") and the
parties shall make a subsequent compensating payment (together with simple
interest at the Applicable Rate to reflect any difference between the Closing
Date Calculation and the Final Calculation. The parties acknowledge and agree
that, in the event that any litigation is instituted against any Seller, the
Companies, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates on or prior to the
Closing Date that arises out of or relates to any portion of the Retiree Welfare
Benefit Modification, and, as a result of such litigation, an Order has been
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the implementation or
effectiveness of such Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification, and such Order is in
effect as of the Closing, Sellers shall, for purposes of this Section 2.5, be
deemed not to have effected such portion of the Retiree Welfare Benefit
Modification; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if no such Order is in effect on the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "NOTE DATE") and the
Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification is thereupon made in whole or in part
effective as of January 1, 2003, then on the Note Date Purchaser shall cause the
entity holding 100% of the capital stock of Purchaser on the Closing Date to
issue to Sellers a promissory note containing the terms set forth in Schedule
2.5.1, in principal amount equal to the reduction in the Initial Purchase Price
resulting from such an Order being in effect as of the Closing to the extent of
the additional portion of the Anticipated Savings realized subsequent to such
Order on or prior to the Note Date.

            2.5.2    In the event the fair market value of the assets of
Sellers' Salaried Trust transferred to Purchaser's Salaried Trust pursuant to
Section 6.3.7 (as finally determined pursuant to Section 6.3.7) exceeds 85% of
the ABO as calculated according to the assumptions set forth on Schedule 6.3.7.3
of the Salaried Pension Transferees as of January 1, 2003 (the "PENSION
DETERMINATION DATE") (together with the adjustment as set forth in Section
6.3.7.5), the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by the lesser of the
amount of (i) such excess or (ii) $4,000,000. In the event that 85% of the ABO
of the Salaried Pension Transferees as of the Pension Determination Date
(together with adjustment as set forth in Section 6.3.7.5) exceeds the fair
market value of the assets of Sellers' Salaried Trust transferred to Purchaser's
Salaried Trust pursuant to Section 6.3.7 (as finally determined pursuant to
Section 6.3.7), the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of
such excess. The purchase price adjustment shall be effected on the date of
final determination of the fair market value of the assets of Seller's Salaried
Trust transferred to Purchaser's Salaried Trust pursuant to Section 6.3.7 by
wire transfer of the amount of the adjustment by the party required to pay such
adjustment.

     3.2    TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the Closing as follows:

            3.2.1    at the election of either Sellers or Purchaser on or after
February 15, 2003, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of
business on such date, provided that the terminating party is not in default of
any of its obligations hereunder;

            3.2.2    by mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchaser; or

pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence).

     3.3    PROCEDURE UPON TERMINATION. In the event Purchaser or Sellers, or
both, elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.2, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties, and this

shall be without liability to Purchaser, the Companies or any Seller; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 3.4, and
in Section 6.5 and Section 10.3, shall survive any such termination and shall be
enforceable hereunder; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that nothing in this Section 3.4 shall

                                    ARTICLE 4

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

            Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Purchaser that:

     4.1    ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. Each Company and each Seller is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization as set forth
above or on Annex A and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.
Each Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation under the
laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property and each
other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
assets requires such qualification and where the failure to be so qualified
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     4.2    AUTHORIZATION OF AGREEMENT. Each Seller has all requisite power,
authority and legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated by this
Agreement or to be executed by such Seller in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with this
Agreement, the "SELLER DOCUMENTS"), and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of the Seller
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized and approved by each Seller and no
other proceeding on any Seller's part is necessary to authorize the Seller
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. This Agreement has been, and each of the other Seller Documents will be
at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed and delivered by each
Seller party thereto and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
by the other parties hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and each of
the other Seller Documents when so executed and delivered will constitute,
legal, valid and binding obligations of each Seller, enforceable against each
Seller in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness,
good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

     4.3    CAPITALIZATION.

            4.3.1    The (i) authorized capital stock, (ii) par value per share,
and (iii) number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of
the Companies are as set forth on Annex A. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.3.1, no shares of capital stock of any Company are held by such Company as
treasury stock. Sellers are the record and beneficial

                                        9
<Page>

owners of the Shares in the amounts set forth on Annex A, free and clear of any
and all Liens, and, except as shown on Annex A, the Shares constitute all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Companies. There is no other class
or series of capital stock authorized under any Company's certificate of
incorporation or comparable organizational document.

            4.3.2    All of the Shares were duly authorized for issuance, are
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, were not issued in violation of
any preemptive rights created by statute, the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or comparable organizational document of any Company or any contract and
are not subject to any such preemptive right.

            4.3.3    There is no existing option, warrant, call, right,
commitment or other agreement of any character to which any Seller or Company is
a party requiring, and there are no securities of any Company outstanding which
upon conversion or exchange would require, the issuance, sale or transfer of any
additional shares of capital stock or other equity securities of a Company or
other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to
subscribe for or purchase shares of capital stock or other equity securities of
a Company. None of Sellers or any Company is a party to any voting trust,
stockholder agreement, proxy or other voting agreement with respect to any of
the Shares or to any agreement relating to the issuance, sale, redemption,
transfer or other disposition of the capital stock of any Company.

     4.4    SUBSIDIARIES AND REXNORD AFFILIATES.

            4.4.1    Schedule 4.4.1 hereto sets forth the name of each
Subsidiary and, with respect to each Subsidiary, the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, the number of shares of its authorized capital stock,
the number and class of shares thereof duly issued and outstanding, the names of
all stockholders or other equity owners and the number of shares of stock owned
by each stockholder or the amount of equity owned by each equity owner. The
outstanding shares of capital stock or equity interests of each Subsidiary are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and all such
shares or other equity interests represented as being owned (directly or
indirectly) by any Company are owned by it free and clear of any and all Liens,
except as set forth in Schedule 4.4.1 hereto. No shares of capital stock are
held by any Subsidiary as treasury stock. There is no existing option, warrant,
call, commitment or agreement to which any Subsidiary is a party requiring, and
there are no convertible securities of any Subsidiary outstanding which upon
conversion would require, the issuance of any additional shares of capital stock
or other equity interests of any Subsidiary or other securities convertible into
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary or other

            4.4.2    Schedule 4.4.2 hereto sets forth the name of each entity in
which a Company or a Subsidiary owns less than a majority of the outstanding
voting securities or other voting equity interests (each a "REXNORD AFFILIATE")

incorporated or organized, the number of shares of its authorized capital stock
and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, the number and class of shares thereof duly
issued and outstanding, the names of all stockholders or other equity owners and
the number of shares of stock owned by each stockholder or the amount of equity
owned by each equity owner. The shares of capital stock or equity interests of
each Rexnord Affiliate held by a Company or a Subsidiary have been validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and all such shares or other equity
interests represented as being owned by any Company or Subsidiary are owned by
it free and clear of any and all Liens, except as set forth in Schedule 4.4.2
hereto. With respect to the voting securities or other voting equity interests
in a Rexnord Affiliate owned by a Company or a Subsidiary, there are no existing
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements requiring the issuance of
any additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests of such Rexnord
Affiliate or other securities convertible into shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of such Rexnord Affiliate. The voting securities or other
voting equity interests in the Rexnord Affiliates owned by a Company or a
Subsidiary are not subject to any voting trust, stockholder agreement, proxy or
other voting agreement. To the Knowledge of Sellers, without any investigation,
there is no existing option, warrant, call, commitment or agreement to which any
Rexnord Affiliate is a party requiring, and there are no convertible securities
of any Rexnord Affiliate outstanding which upon conversion would require, the
issuance of any additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
any Rexnord Affiliate or other securities convertible into shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of any Rexnord Affiliate or other equity
security of any Rexnord Affiliate and no such Rexnord Affiliate is a party to
any agreement relating to the issuance, sale, redemption, transfer or other
disposition of the capital stock of any such entity.

            4.4.3    To the Knowledge of Sellers, without any investigation,
each Rexnord Affiliate is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization as set forth on Schedule 4.4.2 and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted. Each Rexnord Affiliate is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation under the laws of each jurisdiction in which
it owns or leases real property and each other jurisdiction in which the conduct
of its business or the ownership of its assets requires such qualification.

reflect in all material respects the combined financial condition and results of
operations of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, subject to normal recurring
year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or in the
aggregate, be materially adverse to the Companies and the Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole) and the absence of notes. For the purposes hereof, the combined balance

            Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15, all of the Material Contracts

a Company and/or a Subsidiary, enforceable against it/them and, to the Knowledge
of Sellers, against the other third parties thereto, in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether

on Schedule 4.15, no Company and no Subsidiary is in material breach or material
default under any Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no

other party thereto, and no Company or Subsidiary has received any written
notice that it is in default in any material respect under any Material
Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of Sellers, is any other party to any Material
Contract in default thereunder in any material respect.

            Sellers have delivered or otherwise made available to Purchaser
true, correct and complete copies of the Material Contracts.

     4.16   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

            4.16.1   Schedule 4.16.1 sets forth all written and material oral
"employee benefit plans," (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and all other
plans, agreements, programs or arrangements including, without limitation, stock
option, stock purchase, or other equity-based compensation plans or
arrangements, in each case providing compensation or other benefits with respect
to any current or former employee, director, officer or consultant of any
Company or Subsidiary of any Company, or of any employees of Sellers whose
employment relates primarily to a Company or a Subsidiary or a Rexnord Business
which are or within the past six plan years preceding the Closing Date have been
maintained or contributed to by Seller, any Company, or any Subsidiary, or with
respect to which Seller, any Company, or any Subsidiary is or was obligated to
contribute thereunder or has any obligation or liability (the "INVENSYS PLANS")
which are the only plans, programs, or arrangements covering any such current or
former employee, director, officer or consultant of any Company or Subsidiary of
any Company or Seller. Schedule 4.16.1 separately identifies each Invensys Plan
sponsored or which will be maintained by any Company or any Subsidiary after the
Closing Date (the "COMPANY PLANS"). Schedule 4.16.1 separately identifies each
Invensys Plan which is a plan that is maintained outside the United States
primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens ("NON-U.S. PLANS").

            4.16.2   True, correct and complete copies of the following
documents, with respect to each of the Invensys Plans, if applicable, have been
made available or delivered to

                                       20
<Page>

Purchaser: (i) any plans and related trust documents, and amendments thereto;
(ii) Forms 5500 for the past two years; (iii) the last Internal Revenue Service
determination letter, if applicable; (iv) the most recent actuarial report; (v)
summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications, and any other
written communications which have been distributed to such Invensys Plan's
participants; (vi) written description of any unwritten plans; and (vii) all
annuity contracts or other funding instruments.

            4.16.3   The Invensys Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of
the Code have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so
qualified, and the trusts maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal
income taxation under Section 501 of the Code, and nothing has occurred since
the date of the most recent such determination (other than the effective date of
certain amendments to the Code the remedial amendment period of which has not
yet expired) which is reasonably likely to cause the loss of such qualification
or exemption or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under
ERISA or the Code.

            4.16.4   The Company Plans, other than Non-U.S. Plans, (including
after giving effect to the Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification) have been
maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms and with all
provisions of the Code and ERISA (including rules and regulations thereunder)
and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations and can be amended
or terminated at any time other than as precluded by any collective bargaining
agreement or the National Labor Relations Act.

            4.16.5   With respect to each Company Plan that is a Non-U.S. Plan,
all employer and employee contributions required by law or by the terms of such
Non-U.S. Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with the
Company's normal accounting practices and each Non-U.S. Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities.

            4.16.6   Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.16.6, with respect to
each Company Plan which is not a Non-U.S. Plan and which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (each, a "PENSION PLAN"):

                   4.16.6.1 The funding method used in connection with each
Pension Plan which is subject to the minimum funding requirements of ERISA is
acceptable and the actuarial assumptions used in connection with funding each
such plan are reasonable. Schedule 4.16.6 sets forth as of the last day of the
last plan year the "fair market value of assets" and the "amount of unfunded
current liability" as defined in Section 412(l) of the Code. No "accumulated
funding deficiency" (for which an excise tax is due or would be due in the
absence of a waiver) as defined in Section 412 of the Code or as defined in
Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA, whichever may apply, has been incurred with respect
to any Pension Plan with respect to any plan year, whether or not waived. None
of any Seller, any Company, nor any Subsidiary has failed to pay when due any
"required installment", within the meaning of Section 412(m) of the Code and
Section 302(e) of ERISA, whichever may apply, with respect to any Pension Plan.
None of any Seller, any Company, nor any Subsidiary is subject to any lien
imposed under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA, whichever
may apply, with respect to any Pension Plan. None of any Seller, any Company,
nor any Subsidiary has any liability for unpaid contributions with respect to
any Pension Plan or employee benefit plan of any foreign government.

                                       21
<Page>

                   4.16.6.2 None of any Seller, any Company, nor any Subsidiary
is required to provide security to a Pension Plan under Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code.

                   4.16.6.3 Each Company (or Sellers, if applicable) has paid
all premiums (and interest charges and penalties for late payment, if
applicable) due the PBGC with respect to each Pension Plan for each plan year
thereof for which such premiums are required. None of any Seller, any Company,
nor any Subsidiary has engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an
entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA.
There has been no "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA and
the PBGC regulations under such Section) with respect to any Pension Plan and no
such reportable event is expected to occur as a result of consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and none of any Seller, any
Company, nor any Subsidiary is subject to Section 4043(b) of ERISA and no
analogous event has occurred under applicable foreign law. No filing has been
made by any Seller, any Company, nor any Subsidiary with the PBGC, and no
proceeding has been commenced by the PBGC, to terminate any Pension Plan. No
condition exists and no event has occurred that could constitute grounds for the
termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC. None of any Seller, any Company,
nor any Subsidiary has, at any time, (i) ceased operations at a facility so as
to become subject to the provisions of Section 4062(e) of ERISA or analogous
foreign law, (ii) withdrawn as a substantial employer so as to become subject to
the provisions of Section 4063 of ERISA or analogous foreign law, or (iii)
ceased making contributions on or before the Closing Date to any Pension Plan
subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA or analogous foreign law to which any
Seller, any Company, or any Subsidiary made contributions during the six years
prior to the Closing Date.

                   4.16.6.4 No Company or Subsidiary has incurred or will incur
any actual or contingent liability with respect to any Invensys Plan or
otherwise, including any withdrawal liability, or be required to make any
contributions to a multiemployer plan, as a result of any of them being members
of a "controlled group" of corporations, or treated as a single employer with,
Seller within the meaning of Section 414(b), 414(c), 414(m) or 414(n) of the
Code arising from or incurred with respect to any period prior to the Closing
Date.

            4.16.7   With respect to each Company Plan which is not a Non-U.S.
Plan and which is a "Multiemployer Plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA (each, a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN"):

                   4.16.7.1 None of any Seller, any Company, nor any Subsidiary
has, within the six (6) years preceding the Closing, withdrawn from a
Multiemployer Plan in a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as
defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, respectively, so as to result in a
liability, contingent or otherwise (including without limitation the obligations
pursuant to an agreement entered into in accordance with Section 4204 of ERISA),
of any Seller, any Company, or any Subsidiary. None of any Seller, any Company,
nor any Subsidiary has engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an
entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

                   4.16.7.2 All contributions required to be made by any Seller,
any Company, nor any Subsidiary of each to each Multiemployer Plan have been
made when due.

                                       22
<Page>

                   4.16.7.3 If, as of the Closing Date, Sellers, the Companies,
and all Subsidiaries were to withdraw from all Multiemployer Plans, they would
incur no liabilities to such plans under Title IV of ERISA or analogous foreign
law.

                   4.16.7.4 To the Knowledge of Sellers, with respect to each
Multiemployer Plan: (i) no such Multiemployer Plan has been terminated or has
been in reorganization under ERISA so as to result, directly or indirectly, in
any liability, contingent or otherwise, of any Seller, any Company, nor any
Subsidiary under Title IV of ERISA; (ii) no proceeding has been initiated by any
person (including the PBGC) to terminate such Multiemployer Plan; (iii) a "mass
withdrawal", as defined in PBGC Reg. Section 2640.7, with respect to such
Multiemployer Plan has not occurred; (iv) none of any Seller, any Company, nor
any Subsidiary has any reason to believe that such Multiemployer Plan will be
terminated or will be reorganized under ERISA or that a "mass withdrawal", as
defined in PBGC Reg. Section 2640.7, will occur with respect to such
Multiemployer Plan; and (v) none of any Seller, any Company, nor any Subsidiary
or expects to withdraw in a "complete withdrawal" or "partial withdrawal" from
such Multiemployer Plan.

            4.16.8   Except as disclosed in Schedules 4.16.6, none of Purchaser,
any Company, nor any Subsidiary shall incur any actual or contingent liability
for any "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as defined in Sections
4203 and 4205 of ERISA, respectively, from any Invensys Pension Plan which is a
Multiemployer Plan or any liability under Sections 4062, 4063 or 4201 of ERISA
as a result of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

            4.16.9   As of and including the Closing, Sellers, the Companies and
the Subsidiaries shall have made all contributions and payments required to be
made by each of them up to and including the Closing with respect to each
Invensys Plan, or adequate accruals therefor will have been provided for and
will be reflected on the Financial Statements provided to Purchaser by Sellers.

            4.16.10  Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16.10 hereto, none of any
Seller, any Company, or any Subsidiary of each, or any Invensys Plan has any
present or future obligation to make any payment to, or with respect to, any
present or former employee of any Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any
retiree medical benefit plan or other retiree welfare plan.

            4.16.11  None of any Company nor any Subsidiary of any Company, nor
any plan fiduciary of any Company Plan has engaged in any transaction in
violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or any "prohibited transaction," as
defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, for which no exemption exists under
Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(2) or (d) of the Code, or has otherwise
violated the provisions of Part 4 of Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA. None of any
Company nor any Subsidiary of any Company has knowingly participated in a
violation of Part 4 of Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA by any plan fiduciary of any
Company Plan nor been assessed any civil penalty under Section 502(l) of ERISA.

            4.16.12  There is no action, order (except Qualified Domestic
Relations Orders), writ, injunction, judgment or decree outstanding or claim,
suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitrable action, governmental audit or
investigation relating to or seeking benefits under any Company

                                       23
<Page>

Plan that is pending, threatened or anticipated against any Seller, any Company
or any Subsidiary or any Company Plan, and to the Knowledge of Sellers, there
exist no facts or circumstances that could give rise to any such action, writ,
injunction, judgment, decree, claim, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitrable
action, audit or investigation.

            4.16.13  None of any Seller, any Company nor any Subsidiary of each
has any announced plan or legally binding commitment to create any additional
Invensys Plan or to amend or modify any existing Invensys Plan, except as
provided herein or as required by law.

            4.16.14  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in the
acceleration or creation of any rights of any person to benefits under any
Company Plan (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the vesting or
exercisability of any stock options, the acceleration of the vesting of any
restricted stock, the acceleration of the accrual or vesting of any benefits
under any Company Plan or the acceleration or creation of any rights under any
employment, retention, severance, parachute or change in control agreement).

            4.16.15  Each Invensys Plan which is not a Non-U.S. Plan and which

reasonable likelihood of leading to the imposition of any material liability,
penalty or Tax.

employment contracts or the forms of employment contracts with respect to all
Non-U.S. Employees whose annual cash compensation exceeds sixty thousand dollars

            4.16.20  Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16.20, all Non-U.S. Plans
are maintained by and apply to a Company or a Subsidiary exclusively. All
funding vehicles (including trusts, escrow accounts or any other source of

<Page>

            6.3.1    Sellers shall or shall cause an Affiliate (other than the
Companies and the Subsidiaries) to employ prior to the Closing Date each
employee of any Company or any Subsidiary employed in the United States who was
absent from active employment on the Closing Date due to long term disability or
who is a former employee receiving severance benefits (an "INACTIVE EMPLOYEE"),
and such Inactive Employees shall be deemed to have transferred their employment
from the Companies and the Subsidiaries to Sellers or any such Affiliate prior
to the close of business on the Closing Date. Purchaser acknowledges that by
purchasing the Shares, it shall, through the Companies and the Subsidiaries,
employ all of the employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries (other than
Inactive Employees) and any employees of Sellers whose employment relates
primarily to a Company or a Subsidiary or the Rexnord Business at the close of
business on the Closing Date ("EMPLOYEES"). All Employees of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries who are actively at work (including Employees on vacation and
on any Approved Absence, as defined below) as of the Closing Date shall continue
to be employed on and after the Closing Date. All other Employees of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries employed in the United States who are not
actively at work on the Closing Date due to an approved leave of absence
(including active military service), short term disability (including employees
on workers' compensation) or a layoff with active recall rights in place
pursuant to the terms of applicable Company policy or labor agreement ("APPROVED
ABSENCE"), shall continue to be eligible for active employment by the Companies
and the Subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of such
leave of absence, short term disability or layoff. All Employees of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries employed outside the United States ("NON-U.S.
EMPLOYEES") shall continue to be employed on and after the Closing Date by
Purchaser on terms and conditions required by and in accordance with the
provisions of applicable foreign, federal or state Law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall (x) prevent Purchaser from altering the terms, salary, wages or
benefits after the Closing Date of any Employee except as specifically provided
herein or (y) create any obligation on the part of Purchaser to continue the
employment of any Employee for any definite period of time following the Closing
Date.

            6.3.2    For a period of at least 12 months immediately following
the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees to provide, and shall cause the Companies and
the Subsidiaries to provide the Employees with compensation and benefits
substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided
to such Employees prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide, and shall
cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to provide, severance pay to any
Employee who is terminated by any of the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries
during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending 12 months following
the Closing Date or, in the case of Non-U.S. Employees, for such other period of
time as determined by applicable Law. The amount of such severance payable to
any Employee terminated within 12 months of the Closing Date shall be the amount
of severance determined pursuant to Schedule 6.3.2 with respect to such
individual or, in the case of Non-U.S. Employees, as determined by applicable
Law.

            6.3.3    Purchaser agrees to honor, or assume where applicable, and
shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to honor, or assume where
applicable, the obligations of Sellers, Companies and the Subsidiaries under the
provisions of any Company Plan, employment, retention, severance (whether
pursuant to individual contract as set forth on Schedule 6.3.3 (with respect to
all Non-U.S. Employees whose annual cash compensation is in excess of Sixty
Thousand Dollars ($60,000), the names of such employees have been set forth on

                                       34
<Page>

Schedule 6.3.3), or Company Plan, program or policy or mandated by Law),
indemnification, collective bargaining agreements (including any benefit plans
maintained pursuant to such collective bargaining agreements and any trust
agreements or other funding mechanisms established to fund such benefit plans),
and "social plans" between or among any of Sellers, the Companies or any
Subsidiary and any Employee, which agreements and plans are set forth on
Schedule 6.3.3. Sellers and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary so that,
effective immediately following the Closing Date, Purchaser has assumed (i) all
obligations and liabilities of Sellers under any employment agreements relating
to Employees and (ii) all collective bargaining agreements with respect to the
Employees, and Sellers shall have no further obligation or liability with
respect to any such agreements.

            6.3.4    Purchaser agrees that, with respect to all of its employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements covering or otherwise benefiting any of
the Employees on or after the Closing Date, service with the Companies and the
Subsidiaries shall be counted for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and level of benefits (with respect to vacation and severance) and
benefit accruals (with respect to any defined benefit pension plan), to the same
extent such service was counted under the corresponding employee benefit plans,
programs, or arrangements of the Companies and the Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date and, in the case of Non-U.S. Employees, further to the extent and
in the manner provided for under applicable Law, except to the extent that such
credit would result in duplication of benefits for such period of service.

            6.3.5    Purchaser shall provide welfare benefit of the type
described in Section 3(1) of ERISA and in accordance with this Section 6.3, as
of the Closing Date so as to ensure uninterrupted coverage of all Employees
employed in the United States ("U.S. EMPLOYEES"). Such plans shall grant credit
for amounts paid by the U.S. Employees during the applicable plan year preceding
the Closing Date (including applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits) and shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability provisions, waiting period requirements or any similar provision to
the extent such U.S. Employees had satisfied these requirements and provisions
and paid these amounts under similar Sellers' plans as of the Closing Date.

            6.3.6    Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cover, or
cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to cover, the U.S. Employees under one
or more defined contribution plans and trusts intended to qualify under Section
401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code (the "PURCHASER DC PLAN"). Sellers shall
permit U.S. Employees to make a "direct rollover" of such U.S. Employees' vested
account balances (including loans to U.S. Employees) of U.S. Employees under any
of the Company Plans which is a defined contribution plan ("SELLERS' DC PLAN")
to Purchaser DC Plan. In connection with any such direct rollover elected by any
such U.S. Employee, Purchaser shall allow any such U.S. Employee's outstanding
loan and related promissory note under Sellers' DC Plan to be directly rolled
over into Purchaser DC Plan. Sellers and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in
good faith to effect such distributions as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date.

            6.3.7

                   6.3.7.1  Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
establish one (1) or more qualified defined benefit plans ("PURCHASER'S SALARIED
PLANS") and a trust to fund

                                       35
<Page>

Purchaser's Salaried Plans ("PURCHASER'S SALARIED TRUST") to assume the
liabilities attributable to the salaried, non-union, current and former, U.S.
Employees of the Rexnord Business (collectively, the "SALARIED PENSION
TRANSFEREES") as of the Closing Date entitled to a benefit under the Invensys
Pension Plan applicable to such Salaried Pension Transferees ("ASSUMED SALARIED
PENSION PLAN LIABILITIES"). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
assume all defined benefit and defined contribution plans sponsored by the
Companies and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

                   6.3.7.2  As soon as administratively practicable following
the Closing Date but no later than one hundred twenty (120) days post-Closing,
Purchaser: (i) shall file an application with the IRS for a determination letter
on the qualification under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code of all
Purchaser's Salaried Plans or (ii) shall supply Sellers with an opinion of legal
counsel that Purchaser's Salaried Plans qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a)
of the Code. If Purchaser files with the IRS for a determination letter,
Purchaser agrees to take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain a favorable
determination.

                   6.3.7.3  Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date, but in no event prior to the confirmation (as set forth in Section
6.3.7.2) that Purchaser's Salaried Plans comply with Sections 401(a) and 501(a)
of the Code, Sellers shall cause the transfer of an amount of assets equal to
the product of (x) the fair market value of all of the assets of Sellers'
Salaried Trust (as defined below) as of the Pension Determination Date and (y) a
fraction with the numerator equal to the ABO (as defined below) of the Salaried
Pension Transferees and the denominator equal to the ABO of all participants in
the Invensys Pension Plan as of the Pension Determination Date from Sellers'
qualified pension trust for the Invensys Pension Plan (the "SELLERS' SALARIED
TRUST"), and Purchaser shall cause Purchaser's Salaried Trust to accept such
transfer of assets. Such transfer shall be subject to the provisions of Section
6.3.7.4 below. For purposes of this Section, "ABO" shall be calculated using the
actuarial assumptions for determining the amount of the accumulated benefit
obligations of Sellers' Salaried Plan in accordance with FASB 87 and set forth
on Schedule 6.3.7.3 attached hereto.

                   6.3.7.4  Any transfer of assets from Sellers' Salaried Trust
to Purchaser's Salaried Trust shall comply with Sections 414(l) and 411(d)(6) of
the Code and applicable PBGC regulations and assumptions, as described in PBGC
regulation appendix B to Part 4044, Table I, as of the Pension Determination
Date, and to the extent a transfer of assets in accordance with Section 6.3.7.3
above, would not be permitted under the PBGC regulations the amount of transfer
shall be accordingly adjusted.

                   6.3.7.5  The transfer, when made from Sellers' Salaried Trust
to Purchaser's Salaried Trust, shall be in cash and shall reflect such assets,
and their proportional amount of any increase (or decrease) in the actual rate
of return earned on the actual investments in Sellers' Salaried Trust from the
Pension Determination Date to the actual date of transfer to Purchaser's
Salaried Trust.

                   6.3.7.6  Upon the receipt of the assets by Purchaser's
Salaried Trust in accordance with this Section 6.3.7, Purchaser and Purchaser's
Salaried Plans shall be solely responsible for the Assumed Salaried Pension Plan
Liabilities.

                                       36
<Page>

                   6.3.7.7  Purchaser and Sellers shall take such other actions
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the assumption of the Assumed Salaried
Pension Plan Liabilities including, without limitation, the timely filing of IRS
Forms 5310-A and the timely filing of any necessary PBGC filings.

                   6.3.7.8  The amount to be transferred under this Section 6.3
shall initially be calculated by Sellers' actuary and shall be subject to review
and agreement by Purchaser's actuary. If Purchaser's and Sellers' actuaries
cannot agree on the amount to be transferred, Purchaser and Sellers shall
appoint a third mutually acceptable actuary whose decision on the amount to be
transferred shall be binding on the parties. Sellers and Purchaser shall
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to such actuary all information the actuary
shall reasonably request for purposes of making this determination. Sellers and
Purchaser shall cause the actuary to act promptly to resolve the issues in
dispute. The fees and expenses of such actuary shall be borne equally (i.e., on
a 50/50 basis) by Sellers and Purchaser.

                   6.3.7.9  Effective on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
assume all liability for providing retiree health and life insurance benefits to
all Employees and all former employees of the Rexnord Business entitled to such
benefits under any plan, program or arrangement provided by Sellers, the
Companies or the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

                   6.3.7.10 As soon as practical following the Closing Date,
certain assets and liabilities relating to Non-U.S. Employees and former
Non-U.S. Employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries with accrued pensions
under Invensys Pension Scheme in the U.K. shall be transferred to a pension
scheme designated by Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser shall comply with the
provisions of Schedule 6.3.7.10 with respect to such transfer.

                   6.3.7.11 Purchaser and Sellers agree that as soon as
practical following the Closing Date certain assets and liabilities relating to
Non-U.S. Employees and former Non-U.S. Employees of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries (with the exception of Non-U.S. Employees described in Section
6.3.7.10, above) shall be transferred to a pension scheme designated by
Purchaser in accordance with an agreement entered into on or prior to the
Closing Date which agreement shall be negotiated in good faith based on
commercially reasonable best efforts.

                   6.3.7.12 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                   6.3.7.13 Except as set forth in this Section 6.3.7 or as
disclosed on Schedule 6.3.3, Purchaser shall not assume any obligations or
liabilities with respect to any Invensys Plan.

            6.3.8    Sellers shall provide promptly to Purchaser, dates of
birth, dates of hire and dependent information relating to the Employees or
relating to the service of Employees with Sellers prior to the Closing Date.
Sellers and Purchaser shall each cooperate with the other and shall provide to
the other such documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably
necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 6.3.

            6.3.9    Sellers and Purchaser shall each cooperate with the other
to effectuate the provisions of this Section 6.3 including, but not limited to,
distributing all necessary notices

                                       37
<Page>

to the Employees after such notices to the Employees have been approved by the
non-distributing party which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, and
making all necessary governmental notices and filings with respect to any
changes in any company Plans including any notices required with respect to any
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) which may occur as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Promptly after the Closing, in
addition to any other actions required to be taken by Sellers under this Section
6.3, Sellers shall furnish Purchaser with any and all data, reports,
compilations, calculations, and working papers not then in the possession of
Purchaser that relate to the Company Plans and other liabilities that are being
assumed by Purchaser hereunder and that are reasonably necessary to enable
Purchaser to fulfill any and all obligations it has assumed under this Section
6.3.

            6.3.10   Between the date hereof and the Closing, Sellers shall use
their reasonable commercial efforts to amend the retiree health and life
insurance benefits provided to the current, active and former employees of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries, such that such benefits are modified as set
forth on Schedule 6.3.10 (the "RETIREE WELFARE BENEFIT MODIFICATION"). On or
before October 21, 2002, Sellers shall provide written notice to each affected
employee and former employee of the Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification
resulting from any such amendment. The amount of Anticipated Savings achieved
shall be calculated by comparing the APBO as of December 31, 2002 reflecting the
Retired Welfare Benefit Modification to the APBO as of December 31, 2002 prior
to the Retiree Welfare Benefit Modification utilizing the assumption and
methodologies set forth in Schedule 6.3.10. Such calculations shall initially be
made by an actuary selected by Sellers but shall not be deemed conclusive until
agreed by an actuary selected by Purchaser. If the actuaries cannot agree after
a reasonable period, they shall agree on a third actuary whose decision shall be
binding and whose fee shall be equally divided between Sellers and Purchaser.

            6.3.11   To the extent required by Law, Purchaser agrees that it
shall, or shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries, to maintain any
voluntary employee beneficiary association qualifying as a tax exempt trust
pursuant to Section 501(c)(9) of the Code ("VEBA") for the sole purpose for
which such VEBA was created and to the extent required by Law the assets of any
VEBA existing at the Closing Date at the Companies or the Subsidiaries shall be
expended or distributed solely to or for the benefit of such Employees and their
beneficiaries who contributed such assets as employee contributions to fund such
VEBA prior to the Closing Date.

     6.4    PRESERVATION OF RECORDS. Subject to Section 9.6.2.3 (relating to the
preservation of Tax records), Sellers and Purchaser agree that each of them
shall preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the business of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries for a period of five (5) years from the Closing
Date and shall make such records and personnel available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings against or governmental investigations of
Sellers or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable Sellers or
Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and
each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In
the event Sellers or Purchaser wish to destroy such records within five (5)
years of the Closing Date, such party shall first give ninety (90) days prior
written notice to the other and such other party shall have the right at its
option and expense, upon prior

                                       38
<Page>

written notice given to such party within that ninety (90) day period, to take
possession of the records.

     6.5    PUBLICITY. Neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall issue any press
release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless, based upon advice of their respective legal counsel, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Purchaser or the parent company of Sellers list securities,
provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party intending to
make such release shall use its reasonable efforts consistent with such
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

     6.6    [Intentionally Omitted].

     6.7    USE OF NAME. Purchaser agrees that it shall cause the Companies and
the Subsidiaries to (i) as soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in any
event within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, cease to make any use
of the name "Invensys" or "BTR" or any service marks, trademarks, trade names,
identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or

similar thereto (collectively, the "SELLER MARKS"), (ii) immediately after the
Closing, cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with any Seller or
any of their Affiliates and (iii) effective as of the Closing, in the case of
any Company or any Subsidiary whose name includes the name "Invensys" or "BTR",
change its corporate name to a name that does not include the name "Invensys" or
"BTR" and make any necessary legal filings with the appropriate Governmental
Body to effect such change. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Companies and their Affiliates to remove, strike over
or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks from all materials owned by any Company
or Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any vehicles, business cards,
schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional
materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other materials; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Company or the Subsidiary may during the period that is one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date continue to use any such
material containing a Seller Mark to the extent that it is not practicable to
remove or obliterate such Seller Mark. Use of the names "Invensys" or "BTR" by
the Companies, the Subsidiaries and/or their Affiliates, during such one hundred
eighty (180) day period shall be governed by the Trademark and Trade Name
License Agreement.

     6.8    INSURANCE.

            6.8.1    Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, upon Closing, all
insurance coverage provided in relation to the Rexnord Business pursuant to
policies maintained by any Seller or its Affiliates (other than any Company or
Subsidiary) (whether such policies are maintained with third party insurers or
with Seller or its Affiliates (other than any Company or Subsidiary) shall cease
and no further coverage shall be available to any Company or Subsidiary as an
Affiliate under any such policies that are "claims made" basis policies but
(subject to the terms of any relevant policy) without prejudice to any accrued
claims which a Company or a

                                       39
<Page>

Subsidiary or any Seller or Affiliate (in the latter case in relation to the
Rexnord Business) may have at Closing, provided that the Rexnord Business shall
retain the benefit of "occurrence" based policies of insurance in relation to
events occurring prior to Closing but in respect of which no claim has yet
arisen at the time of Closing.

            6.8.2    Purchaser and Sellers agree that any claims made under the
insurance policies referred to in Section 6.8.1 in respect of the Rexnord
Business (other than any Aircraft Liability Policy) shall be administered and
collected by Sellers (or by a claims handler appointed by Sellers) on behalf of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall cooperate fully with Sellers to enable Sellers to
comply with the requirements of the relevant insurer, and Purchaser shall
provide such information and assistance as Sellers may reasonably request in
connection with any such claim. Sellers shall pursue claims on behalf of
Purchaser and/or the Rexnord Business for recovery in respect of the policies
attributable to the Rexnord Business as requested by Purchaser. Any monies
received by Sellers as a result of such claims shall be paid over to Purchaser,
net of all reasonable costs and expenses of recovery (including, without
limitation, all reasonable handling and collection charges by any claims handler
appointed by Sellers). Sellers shall continue to maintain the "occurrence" based
policies described in Section 6.8.1 in full force and effect until their current
expiry date following the Closing. Sellers shall take any and all action
necessary (including, without limitation, obtaining any consent or authorization
of any insurer) to enable Purchaser, the Companies and the Subsidiaries to
obtain the benefit of any Aircraft Liability Policy in effect on the date hereof
with respect to any occurrences covered by such policies occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date.

     6.9    REASONABLE COMMERCIAL EFFORTS. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its
reasonable commercial efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in

effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions

Purchaser and Sellers will promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days after execution of this Agreement, make all filings or submissions as are

                                       40
<Page>

term "Foreign Governmental Approval" shall mean any consent or Order of, with or
to any foreign Governmental Body set forth on Schedule 4.6.2 or Schedule 5.3.2.
Each of Purchaser and Sellers will promptly furnish to the other such necessary

with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the
HSR Act or to obtain any Foreign Governmental Approval. Each of Purchaser and
Sellers will promptly provide the other with copies of all written
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of all oral
communications) between each of them or their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Body, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Purchaser and Sellers will promptly notify the other of the
receipt and content of any inquiries or requests for additional information made
by any Governmental Body in connection therewith and shall promptly (i) comply
with any such inquiry or request and (ii) provide the other with a description
of the information provided to any Governmental Body with respect to any such

other apprised of the status of any such inquiry or request.

     6.11   CONTACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS. Without the prior
written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,

Company or Subsidiary in connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of
this Agreement.

     6.12   INVENSYS COMMITMENTS. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify Seller for any amounts actually paid by Seller following the Closing
in respect of any obligations of any Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to
Commitments listed on Schedule 6.12 made by Invensys and its Affiliates (other
than a Company or a Subsidiary) with respect to the activities (financial or
otherwise) of a Company or a Subsidiary (other than any fee or other cost
related to any letter of credit, performance bond, bid bond or bank guarantee).
Within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser agrees that it will (i)
cause to be issued by a nationally recognized financial institution letters of
credit (the "REPLACEMENT LETTERS OF CREDIT") with face amounts equal to the
letters of credit listed on Schedule 6.12 (the "REPLACED LETTERS OF CREDIT") and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Replaced Letters of Credit
to be replaced with the Replacement Letters of Credit and cause the parties
holding the Replaced Letters of Credit to be released to Sellers and/or cancel
the Replaced Letters of Credit. In the event that Purchaser is unable to cause
any Replaced Letters of Credit to be so released or cancelled within ninety (90)
days of the Closing Date, and with respect to any bid bonds or performance bonds
listed on Schedule 6.12, Purchaser and Sellers shall enter into such reasonable
arrangements as shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers pursuant
to which Purchaser shall cause to be issued to Sellers a letter of credit issued
by a nationally recognized financial institution with a face amount equal to the
aggregate of the Replaced Letters of Credit not so released or cancelled and the
face amount of any bid bonds or performance bonds listed on Schedule 6.12
entitling the Sellers to draw on such letter of credit in the event that any
party draws on such Replaced Letter of Credit, bid bonds, or performance bonds.
At its option, Purchaser may obtain a bid bond or performance bond to back a bid
bond or performance bond listed on Schedule 6.12 (instead of a letter of
credit), upon arrangements reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller,
provided that the credit quality of the new bond is equal to or better than the
credit quality of the bond it backs. For purposes of the foregoing, "Commitment"

                                       41

similar instruments.

Business or is necessary to the conduct of the business of Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries) as conducted up to
and through the Closing Date, after written notice by a Seller to Purchaser,
Purchaser agrees to grant Sellers and/or their Affiliates a perpetual,
nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, fully paid-up license to use

Affiliates, the Companies and the Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Purchaser (and use commercially reasonable efforts to

financings undertaken by Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with the preparation of written offering
materials used to complete such financings, to the extent information contained
therein relates to Sellers, the Companies or the Subsidiaries. In connection
with the foregoing, Sellers shall promptly deliver to Purchaser such combined
interim financial statements (including notes thereto) of the Rexnord Business
as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser for inclusion in such offering
materials. Unless otherwise agreed, such interim financial statements shall be
in Useable Form. Sellers specifically acknowledge that they shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Requisite June Financial

its best efforts to cause Ernst & Young LLP to provide Purchaser, at Purchaser's
expense, with all opinions and consents (including, without limitation, audit

Subsidiaries necessary for inclusion in any offering memoranda prepared in
connection with any offering of securities pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated
under the Securities Act, or for the completion of filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act and the Securities

reasonable efforts to cause any Excluded Cash to be distributed to Purchaser (or

At the end of the Excluded Cash Period, Purchaser shall pay to Invensys an
amount in cash equal to (i) the aggregate amount of Excluded Cash distributed by
the Companies and the Subsidiaries to Purchaser during the Excluded Cash Period
in compliance with Law and without the incurrence of any Tax or subjecting
Purchaser, any Company or any Subsidiary to any adverse Tax consequence and
without repaying any Post-Closing Intercompany Debt (expressed in U.S. Dollars),

expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants and other advisors) incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates in
complying with its obligations under this Section 6.17. The distribution of any

Price in the amount of such Excluded Cash.

     6.18   DELAYED TRANSFER OF CHINA SHARES. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge
and agree that in the event necessary regulatory approvals for the transfer of
the shares of Changzhou Hansen Jianglang Transmission Co. Ltd. (China) are not
obtained by the date all other conditions to Closing are satisfied or able to be
satisfied pursuant to Article 7, (i) the inability to effect such transfer shall
not be deemed to be the failure of a condition precedent to the obligations of
Purchaser or Sellers pursuant to Article 7 and (ii) at Closing, Purchaser and
Sellers shall enter into a Transition Agreement for China, substantially in the
form attached hereto as Annex B.

     6.19   PRE-CLOSING REORGANIZATIONS.

Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve a
resolution of this matter which would operationally and economically achieve the
objectives of such assignment.

            6.23.1   The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
acquire title to the property located at Ohsener Strasse 79-83, Hameln, Germany

Companies and the Subsidiaries for all Losses incurred by such Persons as a
result of the failure of a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller to acquire title
to the Stephan Drives Property prior to the Closing Date and enter into the
lease transaction contemplated by Section 6.23.2.

            6.23.2   If any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller acquires title
to the Stephan Drives property at any time, the Sellers will lease the Stephan
Drives Property to Rexnord-Stephan GmbH and Co KG or an Affiliate designated by
Purchaser (the "STEPHAN DRIVES LESSEE") on terms no less favorable to the
Stephan Drives Lessee than those in effect as of the date hereof under the Lease
Agreement, dated March 11, 1993, between Rexnord-Stephan GmbH & Co KG and
Immobilien Development und Beteiligungsgesellschaft Niedersachsen GmbH, and
otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, provided
that the lease payments

                                       44

shall be made on a monthly basis and that the term of the lease will be fifteen
(15) years or such other term as may mutually be agreed between Purchaser and
Invensys.

     6.24   COMPLETION OF SCHEDULE TO TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT. Purchaser
and Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to agree upon
the scope and pricing of services to be performed and received under the
Transition Services Agreement as promptly as practicable, and complete the
schedules thereto (that have not already been agreed to by the parties as of the
date hereof, as attached to the form of Transition Services Agreement attached
as Annex C hereto) on or prior to the Closing Date.

     6.25   NONSOLICITATION AND NONHIRE. Invensys covenants and agrees that the
provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the Form on Non-Competition Agreement attached
hereto as Annex D are incorporated by reference herein and shall be in full
force and effect as of the date hereof.

            9.1.1    Subject to Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4, Sellers hereby agree
to jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser, the Companies and
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, successors

and against:

                   9.1.1.1  any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or
resulting from the failure of any representation or warranty of Sellers set

behalf of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, to be true and correct in all
respects as of the date made and as of the Closing Date;

                   9.1.1.3  any Excluded Liability; and

                   9.1.1.4  any Pre-Closing Environmental Liability.

            9.1.2    Subject to Section 9.2 and Section 9.4, Purchaser hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Sellers, and their respective Affiliates,
agents, successors and assigns harmless from and against:

                   9.1.2.1  any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or

            9.2.1    An indemnifying party shall not have any liability for
breaches of representations and warranties under Section 9.1.1.1 or Section
9.1.2.1 (other than with respect to the representations and warranties set forth

Environmental Liabilities under Section 9.1.1.4:

                                       48
<Page>

            (i)    with respect to any individual claim, unless and until the
Losses claimed exceed Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) (the "DE MINIMIS
AMOUNT");

            (ii)   with respect to any claim for indemnification under Section
9.1.1.1 or Section 9.1.2.1, unless and until the total amount of Losses to the
indemnified parties finally determined to arise thereunder based upon,
attributable to or resulting from the breach of all representations and
warranties of the Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, exceed(s), in the
aggregate, Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the "DEDUCTIBLE"), disregarding
any individual claim that does not exceed the De Minimis Amount; and then only
to the extent that such Losses exceed the Deductible;

            (iii)  with respect to any claim for indemnification under Section
9.1.1.4, unless and until the total amount of Losses to the indemnified parties
resulting from Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, exceeds, in the aggregate,
Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the "BASKET"), disregarding any individual
claim that does not exceed the De Minimus Amount; provided, that if the total of
such Losses of all Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceed the amount of the
Basket, then each Purchaser Indemnified Party shall, subject to Section
9.2.1(iv), be entitled to recover the entire amount of such indemnified party's
Losses; and

            (iv)   for any Losses in excess of Ninety Million Dollars
($90,000,000) (the "CAP") once the total amount of Losses to the indemnified
parties indemnifiable under Section 9.1.1.1 and Section 9.1.1.4, as applicable,
exceed, in the aggregate, the Cap.

            9.2.2    An indemnifying party shall not have any liability for
Losses attributable to Downers Grove Liabilities in excess of an amount equal to
the Final Purchase Price once the total amount of such Losses exceeds the Final
Purchase Price.

            9.2.3    An indemnifying party shall not have any liability for
Losses attributable to Asbestos Liabilities in excess of an amount equal to the
Final Purchase Price once the total amount of such Losses exceeds the Final

            9.2.4    An indemnifying party shall not have any liability for
Losses attributable to the General Electric Transportation Dispute in excess of
Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) once the total amount of such Losses
exceeds Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000).

            9.2.5    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in no event shall the aggregate amount of all Losses indemnifiable by the
Sellers to the indemnified parties under Sections 9.1.1.1 and 9.1.1.4, and under
Section 9.1.1.3 with respect to Losses attributable to Downers Grove
Liabilities, Asbestos Liabilities and the General Electric Transportation
Dispute exceed the Purchase Price.

     9.3    SPECIAL LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES.

            9.3.1    Sellers shall have no obligation under Section 9.1.1.1 with
respect to a breach of a representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.20,
and no obligation under Section 9.1.1.4 with respect to a Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses arising in connection

                                       49
<Page>

therewith ("ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES") to the extent that such Environmental Losses
(a) result from (i) any change in the use of real property to non-industrial
purposes or (ii) an investigation of environmental conditions at any Company
Properties, involving physically invasive testing procedures such as soil and
groundwater sampling, undertaken by or for the Purchaser Indemnified Parties,
other than any such investigation (A) affirmatively required under applicable
Law, (B) required by any Order, (C) reasonably determined by Purchaser in good
faith to be necessary in connection with any BONA FIDE construction or material
maintenance activity (including expansion of any facility) at any Company
Property where such construction, maintenance or repair does or would reasonably
be expected to require access to, or disturbance of, soil or groundwater or (D)
approved by Sellers in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or (b) result from Remedial Actions that are inconsistent with the
standard of care set forth in Section 9.3.2.

            9.3.2    Remedial Actions shall be conducted in a reasonable and
cost effective manner, to standards applicable to industrial use properties,
and, to the extent applicable to that particular site, may include the use of
risk-based cleanup standards, natural attenuation, and deed restrictions to
obtain closure where appropriate and available.

            9.3.3    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.2, Sellers shall (a) manage
and control the Remedial Action and resolution of any claim arising out of or
relating to the Downers Grove Liabilities and (b) have the right, but not the
obligation, to manage and control any Remedial Action for which indemnification
is provided under Section 9.1.1.1 or 9.1.1.4 of this Agreement if the cost of
any such Remedial Action would either individually or in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to exceed the Basket in Section 9.2.1(iii). To this end,
Sellers shall have ten (10) days after receipt of notice of a claim for
potential Remedial Action from Purchaser to accept responsibility for such
Remedial Action. Until such time that the Basket is reached or expected to be
reached, Purchaser may take all reasonable actions to the extent consistent with
Section 9.3.2. If Sellers has or takes responsibility for any Remedial Action,
including Downers Grove Liabilities, Purchaser shall provide Sellers and its
contractors and subcontractors with reasonable access to the affected properties
for the purpose of implementing any such Remedial Action, and Purchaser shall
cooperate with Sellers' activities, including signing necessary documentation
for the implementation, monitoring and completion of such Remedial Action,
provided that Sellers indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser from all
Losses that result from such cooperation that are not attributable to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Purchaser or the Companies. The party
implementing the Remedial Action shall control any and all communication with
Governmental Bodies having jurisdiction over the Remedial Action; provided the
party implementing the Remedial Action shall provide the other party with the
opportunity to review and comment on new or materially revised plans for the
Remedial Actions and shall incorporate such reasonable comments to the extent
consistent with section 9.3.2 of this Agreement; provided that the party
controlling the Remedial Action shall make the final determination as to the
content of the filing, provided that such content is reasonably acceptable to
the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party implementing the
Remedial Action shall provide the other party with periodic reports on the
progress of the Remedial Action. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in
undertaking such Remedial Action and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Seller in obtaining no further action determination or similar
determination from the applicable Governmental Body indicating that no
additional

                                       50
<Page>

Remedial Action is required; provided Seller will reimburse Purchaser for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with providing such cooperation
and assistance. Seller shall coordinate any Remedial Action with Purchaser and
shall ensure that any such Remedial Action does not unreasonably interfere with
Purchaser's use and operation of the property.

     9.4    SURVIVAL OF CLAIMS.

            9.4.1    The representations and warranties of Purchaser and Sellers
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of
Article 9 and such representations and warranties shall terminate at the close
of business on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.7 and 4.16.16, shall survive the Closing and remain in
effect indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.20 shall terminate on the date that is seven (7) years after the
Closing Date, and (iii) the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.11 and Section 4.16 (other than the representations contained in Section
4.16.16) shall survive the Closing and any investigation by the parties with
respect thereto until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions thereof) plus sixty (60) days. Any claim for
indemnification with respect to any of such matters which is not asserted by
notice given as herein provided within such specified period of survival may not
be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after such time. Any claim for
indemnification of a Loss asserted within such period of survival as herein
provided will be timely made for purposes hereof.

            9.4.2    Unless a specified period is set forth in this Agreement
(in which event such specified period will control), the covenants in this
Agreement will survive the Closing and remain in effect indefinitely.

            9.4.3    Any claim for indemnification under Section 9.1.1.3 with
respect to Losses attributable to Downers Grove Liabilities which is not
asserted by notice given as herein provided within ten (10) years of the Closing
Date may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after such time. Any
claim for indemnification of a Loss asserted within such period of survival as
herein provided will be timely made for purposes hereof.

            9.4.4    Any claim for indemnification under Section 9.1.1.4 with
respect to Losses attributable to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities which is
not asserted by notice given as herein provided within seven (7) years of the
Closing Date may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after such
time. Any claim for indemnification of a Loss asserted within such period of
survival as herein provided will be timely made for purposes hereof.

     9.5    GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

            9.5.1    In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted
or any claim or demand ("CLAIM") shall be asserted by any third party in respect
of which payment may be sought under Section 9.1 (regardless of the De Minimis
Amount or the Basket referred to above), the indemnified party shall reasonably
and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of which it has
knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying
party. Such notice shall identify specifically the basis under which

                                       51
<Page>

indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 9.1 and enclose true and correct
copies of any written document furnished to the indemnified party by the Person
that instituted the Claim. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its
sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must
be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the indemnifying party shall
not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the indemnifying party
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall within ten
(10) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Claim so requires) notify the
indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the
indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
such Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Claim, then the indemnifying
party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable expenses of
defending such Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Claim, the indemnified party may
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Claim; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party (i)
if so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) if, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that
would make such separate representation advisable; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such
counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any Claim. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Claim. The indemnified party shall
promptly supply to the indemnifying party copies of all correspondence and
documents relating to or in connection with such Claim and keep the indemnifying
party reasonably informed of all developments relating to or in connection with
such Claim (including, without limitation, providing to the indemnifying party
on request updates and summaries as to the status thereof).

            9.5.2    After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered
by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction
and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement
shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Claim
hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice
of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be required to pay
all of the sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such
notice; PROVIDED, that expenses incurred by an indemnified party with respect to
any Claim for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party
promptly upon receipt of a written request for reimbursement therefore from the
indemnified party.

                                       52
<Page>

            9.5.3    The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably
prompt notice of any Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that
the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual Loss and prejudice as a result of
such failure.

     9.6    TAX MATTERS.

            9.6.1    TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

                   9.6.1.1  Sellers hereby agree to jointly and severally
indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties and defend and hold them harmless from
all Losses based upon, related to or resulting from (i) any liability for
Excluded Taxes, (ii) the failure of any representation or warranty of Sellers
contained in Section 4.11 to be true and correct, (iii) any liability for
Transfer Taxes imposed on Sellers pursuant to Section 10.2, and (iv) any
liability for Taxes that arises in connection with netting Final Intercompany
Receivables and Final Intercompany Payables pursuant to section 2.2.2.3 of this
Agreement (e.g., as a result of the deemed distribution of cash or the deemed
distribution of Intercompany Receivables from any Company or Subsidiary to
Purchaser or its Affiliates, including each Company and Subsidiary) that is not
included in the calculation of Final Netting Tax Amount provided in the case of
(i) and (ii), except to the extent Taxes are taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2. Taxes as used
in clause (iv) above shall be determined without regard to reference to any
reduction in Taxes attributable to any Tax asset (e.g., any item of loss or
credit or any carryforward of any loss or credit) of Purchaser or its Affiliates
other than any foreign Tax credit attributable to netting Final Intercompany
Receivables and Final Intercompany Payables pursuant to section 2.2.2.3 of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser Indemnified Parties from any liability for Taxes attributable
to any action taken not in the ordinary course of business after the Closing on
the Closing Date or after the Closing Date by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) or any transferee of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (other than any such action expressly required by
applicable Law or by this Agreement including, without limitation, those
required pursuant to Section 2.2.2.3 of this Agreement.) (a "PURCHASER TAX ACT")
or attributable to a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                   9.6.1.2  Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Companies and
Subsidiaries to, indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, successors or
assigns and representatives and defend and hold them harmless from all Losses
based upon, related to or resulting from (i) any liability for Taxes of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending after the Closing
Date (except to the extent such taxable period began before the Closing Date, in
which case Purchaser's indemnity will cover only that portion of any such Taxes
that are not for the Pre-Closing Tax Period), (ii) any liability for Transfer
Taxes imposed on Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.2, (iii) any liability for
Taxes that are taken into account in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.2, and (iv) any liability for Taxes attributable to a
Purchaser Tax Act or to a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                   9.6.1.3  In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"):

                            9.6.1.3.1  real, personal and intangible property
Taxes ("PROPERTY TAXES") of the Companies and Subsidiaries allocable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period; and

                            9.6.1.3.2  the Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of
the Companies or the Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number
of days in each period.

            9.6.2    PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS.

                   9.6.2.1  If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes
pursuant to Section 9.6.1 (the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), and the other party
(the "TAX INDEMNIFIED PARTY") receives notice of any deficiency, proposed
adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX
CLAIM") with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. If notice of a
Tax Claim is not given to the Tax Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period
of time to allow such party effectively to contest such Tax Claim, or in
reasonable detail to apprise such party of the nature of the Tax Claim, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party (or any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives) to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying
Party position is actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

                   9.6.2.2  With respect to any Tax Claim for which the Tax
Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that it is liable for indemnity
payments under this Article 9, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and
control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole
discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative proceedings with any
taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) in the case of a Tax Claim
relating to Taxes of a Company or Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any
such Tax Claim and (ii) if any Tax Claim could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on (A) Purchaser, any Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates in any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, the Tax Claim
shall not be settled or resolved without Purchaser's consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or (B) Sellers or any of their Affiliates in
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, the Tax Claim shall not
be settled or resolved without Sellers' consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                                       54
<Page>

                   9.6.2.3  The Tax Indemnified Party and each of its respective
Affiliates shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in contesting any Tax
Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Tax
Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

                   9.6.2.4  In no case shall the Tax Indemnified Party, any
Company or Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives settle or otherwise compromise a Tax
Claim without the Tax Indemnifying Party's prior written consent if the Tax
Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing that it is liable for the Tax
Claim. Neither party shall settle a Tax Claim relating to Taxes of a Company or
Subsidiary for a Straddle Period without the other party's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            9.6.3    RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARATION AND FILING OF TAX RETURNS
AND AMENDMENTS.

                   9.6.3.1  For any taxable period of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall timely prepare and file with the appropriate authorities all Tax Returns
required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such returns,
reports and forms; provided that Sellers shall pay Purchaser for any amount owed
by Sellers pursuant to Section 9.6.1.1 with respect to the taxable periods
covered by such Tax Returns no later than three (3) days before such payments
are due. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practice (unless otherwise required by Law). Purchaser shall furnish such Tax
Returns to Sellers for their approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
delayed or withheld) at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns.

                   9.6.3.2  For any taxable period of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries that ends on or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall timely
prepare in accordance with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and
Purchaser or Sellers, as appropriate, shall timely file with the appropriate
authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed. Purchaser shall timely furnish
Tax workpapers to Sellers upon request in accordance with Sellers' past custom
and practice. Sellers shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
Any Tax Returns to be filed by Purchaser or a Company or Subsidiary shall be
furnished by Sellers to Purchasers or the appropriate Company or Subsidiary, as
the case may be, for signature and filing at least five (5) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Returns and Purchaser or applicable Company or
Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall promptly sign and timely file any such Tax
Return. Purchaser and Sellers agree to cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries
to file all Tax Returns for the period including the Closing Date on the basis
that the relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, unless the relevant taxing authority will not accept a Tax Return
filed on that basis.

                   9.6.3.3  Subject to Section 9.6.5 of this Agreement, Sellers
shall be responsible for filing any amended, consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Returns for taxable

                                       55
<Page>

years ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to Section 9.6.5 of this
Agreement, for those jurisdictions in which separate Tax Returns are filed by
the Companies or the Subsidiaries, any required amended Tax Returns shall be
prepared by Sellers and furnished to Purchaser or the Companies or the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for signature and filing at least twenty (20)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, and Purchaser or
applicable Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall promptly sign and
timely file any such amended Tax Return.

            9.6.4    COOPERATION.

                   9.6.4.1  Each of Sellers, the Companies, the Subsidiaries and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably
to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
complying with the requirements set forth in Section 6038A of the Code
(including appointing the appropriate Company to act as a "limited agent" as set
forth in Section 6038A(e)) and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect
to all taxable periods.

                   9.6.4.2  Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other party's request, at the other party's cost and expense, and at
the time and place mutually agreed upon by the parties) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any Tax
Return, any such audit, litigation or other proceeding (including providing
Purchaser with access to those portions of Tax Returns that were prepared on a
consolidated, unity or group basis that relate solely to the Rexnord Business)
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, to
the extent such information and/or explanation is readily available and within
the control of the party to which such request is made. The responsibility to
retain records and information shall include the responsibility to (i) retain
such records and information as are required to be retained by any applicable
taxing authority and (ii) retain such records and information in
machine-readable format where appropriate (to the extent such records and
information are in such format as of the Closing Date) such that the requesting
party shall be able to readily access such records and information. Purchaser
and Sellers shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to each of the Companies and Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Sellers, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
arrangements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Purchaser, or
Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records at its sole cost and expense. The requesting party shall
reimburse the other party for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, or costs of
making employees available, upon receipt of reasonable documentation of such
expenses or costs. Any information or explanation obtained pursuant to this
Section 9.6.4.2 shall be maintained in confidence, except (i) as may be legally
required in connection with claims for refund or in conducting or defending any
Tax audit or other proceeding or (ii) to the extent the disclosing party
provides written permission for such disclosure.

            9.6.5    REFUNDS AND CREDITS.

                   9.6.5.1  Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Companies or
the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or that are Excluded Taxes shall
be for the account of Sellers other than refunds from any carryback (to the
extent permitted under Section 9.6.5.2 of this Agreement) of any item of loss,
deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing
Date into any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any refunds or credits of the Companies or
the Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date shall
be for the account of Purchaser. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Companies or the Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser. Purchaser shall, if Sellers so
request and at Sellers' expense, file for and obtain any refunds or credits, or
cause the Companies or the Subsidiaries to file for and obtain any refunds or
credits, to which Sellers are entitled under this Section 9.6.5; PROVIDED,
Sellers shall not file, and Purchaser shall not be obligated to cause the
Companies or the Subsidiaries to file to obtain any refunds or credits that
could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Purchaser, any
Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates in any taxable period ending
after the Closing Date unless Seller has obtained Purchaser's written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall permit Sellers
to control the prosecution of any such refund claim, provided Sellers have
complied with the preceding sentence.

                   9.6.5.2  Purchaser shall cause each Company and Subsidiary to
elect, where permitted by applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax asset arising
in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date that would, absent such
election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in which the Company or
Subsidiary was included in a consolidated, combined or unitary return with
Sellers or their Affiliates.

            9.6.6    FIRPTA CERTIFICATE. Each of the Sellers that was formed
under the Laws of a jurisdiction within the United States shall provide to
Purchaser a duly executed affidavit of non-foreign status that complies with
Section 1445 of the Code ("Non-Foreign Status Certificate"). Each Company that
was formed under the Laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States and that
has in effect an election under Section 897(i) of the Code shall provide to
Purchaser a duly executed statement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h) certifying that its Shares do not constitute U.S. real property
interests within the meaning of Section 897(c)(1) of the Code ("USRPH Statement"
and, together with a Non-Foreign Status Certificate, "FIRPTA Certificates").

            9.6.7    OTHER TAX MATTERS. The Sellers agree that Purchaser may
make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the purchase
of the Shares of each Non-U.S. Company.

     9.7    EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES.

            9.7.1    The parties hereto agree that, following the Closing, their
respective remedies under Article 9 of this Agreement are their exclusive
remedies under this Agreement, including without limitation, any matter based on
the inaccuracy, untruth, incompleteness or breach of any representation or
warranty of any party hereto contained herein or based on the failure of any
covenant, agreement or undertaking herein (other than any claim for fraud), and

                                       57
<Page>

the parties hereto hereby waive any claims with respect to any other right of
contribution or indemnity available against any indemnifying party hereunder in
such capacity on the basis of common law, statute or otherwise beyond the
express terms of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this exclusive remedy
for damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific
performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or any Seller Document or Purchaser Document;
and

            9.7.2    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
liability for indemnification of any indemnifying party under this Agreement
shall not exceed the Losses of the party entitled to indemnification and shall
not otherwise include special, punitive, exemplary or other similar damages,
other than any such damages claimed by any third party in connection with any
Claim.

            9.7.3    From and after the Closing Date, no Seller shall have any
right of contribution against any Company or Subsidiary for any amount paid to
pursuant to Article 9.

     9.8    ADJUSTMENTS FOR INSURANCE AND TAX BENEFITS. Any indemnification
payable in accordance with Article 9 shall be net of any (i) amounts actually
recovered (after deducting related costs and expenses) by the indemnified party
for the Losses for which such indemnification payment is made under any
insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any Person other than a party
hereto, and (ii) Tax benefits actually realized by the indemnified party in
respect of any Losses for which such indemnification payment is made. The
indemnifying party shall pay the indemnified party if, and to the extent that,
any such Tax benefit is finally determined not to have been realized by the
indemnified party. If any indemnification payment is determined by the relevant
Governmental Body to be taxable to the indemnified party, the indemnifying party
shall also indemnify the indemnified party for any increase in Tax liability by
reason of receipt of the indemnity payment (including any payment under Article
9).

     9.9    TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. Sellers and Purchaser agree that
all indemnification payments made in accordance with Article 9 will be treated
by the parties as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

     9.10   ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES FOR RETIREE WELFARE BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS
CLAIMS. In the event that any Retiree Welfare Benefit Modifications Claim shall
be instituted or asserted, Purchaser shall reasonably and promptly cause written
notice (a "Claim Notice") of such claim to be provided to Sellers. In such
event, Sellers shall have the obligation, at their sole expense, to defend
against such claim (with legal counsel selected by Sellers and reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser) and to negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such
claim; PROVIDED, THAT, no Seller shall settle any such claim without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
If Sellers fail to assume defense of any such claim within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the relevant Claim Notice, or thereafter ceases to vigorously defend
such claim (absent settlement thereof), Purchaser shall have the right (at the
option of Purchaser) to defend, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such
claim (at the cost and expense of Sellers). In the event that Purchaser assumes
defense of any such claim pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
Sellers shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt from Purchaser of
written request therefore, advance the Purchaser the reasonable estimated cost
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel) incurred or to be

                                       58
<Page>

incurred in connection with the defense of such claim. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 9.10, the procedures set forth in Section 9.5 shall
otherwise apply to the defense of any Retiree Welfare Benefit Modifications
Claim.
