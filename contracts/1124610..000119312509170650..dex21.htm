Common Stock otherwise issuable to such holder in respect of such exercise
shall be issued on a net basis, after deducting a sufficient number of shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock to cover such holders Company Option Holder
Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow Funds recovered by the Indemnified Parties
in respect of such

 Indemnification Claim, and the amount otherwise required to be deposited
into the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)(i)(A)_ shall be reduced by

Parent and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that the Option Exchange
Ratio contemplated above shall be derived at the Effective Time from the
Estimated Adjusted Merger Consideration calculated pursuant to _Section

pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_, such notice shall set forth the rights of such
holders of Company Options pursuant to the applicable Company Stock Plan and
inform such holders that the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company

Consideration.

(B) If the Actual Closing Net Working Capital (as determined pursuant to

(A) each item or amount so disputed by the Representative, (B) the
Representatives calculation of each such disputed item or amount, and (C) the

(A) Parent and the Representative shall execute a memorandum (the " _Working
Capital Memorandum_ ") setting forth (1) the resolved items and/or amounts,
if any, and (2) the items or amounts that remain in dispute following such
good faith negotiations;

and amounts set forth in the Working Capital Memorandum to a "Big Four"
accounting firm mutually agreeable to Parent and the Representative (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution in accordance with the terms
and conditions hereof. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall
cause their respective affiliates and representatives to, provide full
cooperation to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall (1) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (2)
consider only those items and amounts identified in the Working Capital

and (2) all other amounts determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to clause (B) this _Section 2.8(c)(iii)_.

(iv) During the period of time from and after the date of the delivery of the
Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement to the Representative until the
Final Adjusted Merger Consideration has been finally determined pursuant to
and in accordance with this _Section 2.8(c)_, Parent shall provide the
Representative and accountants and counsel retained by the Representative
(subject to the execution and delivery of a confidentiality agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) with reasonable access
during normal business hours to the working papers used by Parent (or
accountants and counsel retained by it) to determine the Actual Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to respond to inquiries from the Representative regarding the Actual
Closing Net Working Capital Statement.

2.9 _Payment Procedures_.

(a) _Closing Payment_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (the " _Paying Agent_
") an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Adjusted Merger Consideration,
less (x) the Escrow Amount, (y) the Representative Expense Amount, and (z) any
additional amounts of Final Adjusted Merger Consideration (solely for purposes
of this Section 2.9(a) as if the Estimated Adjusted Merger Consideration is
equivalent to the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration) that Parent is entitled
to withhold in respect of Unvested Cash pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)(ii)_
(such funds being referred to herein as the " _Closing Payment Fund_ "). All
funds held from time to time in the Closing Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms hereof. All
interest and other earnings from any investment of funds held from time to
time in the Closing Payment Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent, and no part of such interest or other earnings shall accrue to or for
the benefit of any Company Stockholders.

(b) _Escrow Fund_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to withhold from the aggregate Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable to holders of Company Common
Stock in the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ an amount of cash equal
to the Company Stockholder Escrow Amount. The Company Stockholder Escrow
Amount shall be withheld from each holder of Company Common Stock on a pro
rata basis, calculated based on each holders Company Stockholder Pro Rata
Percentage. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to the Company
Stockholder Escrow Amount (such funds, together with any additional funds
deposited with the Escrow Agent from time to time pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)(ii)_ in respect of Company Options, being referred to herein as the "
_Escrow Fund_ "). If, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and after
giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that occurs as a result of the
consummation of the Merger), a holder of Company Common Stock shall  



 

16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 hold any Unvested Company Capital Stock, then that portion of any Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement in
respect of any Vested Company Capital Stock held by such Company Stockholder
shall be withheld and deposited into the Escrow Fund prior to the deposit of
any Final Adjusted Merger Consideration payable under this Agreement in
respect of any Unvested Company Capital Stock held by such Company
Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and after giving
effect to any acceleration of vesting that occurs as a result of the
consummation of the Merger) (" _Unvested Cash_ ") and, thereafter, any
Unvested Cash payable to such Company Stockholder under this Agreement shall
be withheld and deposited into the Escrow Fund if and only to the extent
necessary to satisfy such Company Stockholders entire escrow
contribution obligation under this Agreement (with the understanding and
agreement that any Unvested Cash so deposited into the Escrow Fund on behalf
of any such Company Capital Stockholder shall vest prior to any Unvested Cash
payable under this Agreement in respect of any Unvested Company Capital Stock
held by such Company Stockholder that is not so deposited into the Escrow
Fund). The Escrow Fund shall be held and distributed in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow
Fund as partial security for the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth herein. The Escrow Fund (or any portion thereof) shall
be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties upon the terms and conditions set
forth in the Escrow Agreement.

(c) _Representative Expense Fund_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to withhold from the
aggregate Final Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable to holders of
Company Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ an amount
of cash equal to the Representative Expense Amount. The Representative Expense
Amount shall be withheld from each holder of Company Common Stock on a pro
rata basis, calculated based on each holders Company Stockholder Pro Rata
Percentage. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Representative an amount in cash equal to the
Representative Expense Amount (such funds being referred to herein as the "
_Representative Expense Fund_ "). Each holder of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have contributed to the Representative Expense Fund such holders
pro rata portion of the Representative Expense Amount (based on the amount of
the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration payable to such holder of Company
Common Stock under this Agreement in respect of such holders Company Common
Stock (without giving effect to the escrow contributions or holdbacks
contemplated by this Agreement) relative to the aggregate Final Adjusted
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Common Stock), to be held
by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement. If, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (and after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting
that occurs as a result of the consummation of the Merger), a holder of
Company Common Stock shall hold any Unvested Company Capital Stock, then all
or a portion of any Final Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable
under this Agreement in respect of any Vested Company Capital Stock held by
such Company Stockholder shall be withheld and deposited into the
Representative Expense Fund prior to the deposit of any Unvested Cash and,
thereafter, any Unvested Cash payable to such Company Stockholder under this
Agreement shall be withheld and deposited into the Representative Expense Fund
if and only to the extent necessary to satisfy such Company Stockholders
entire representative expense fund contribution obligation under this
Agreement (with the understanding and agreement that any Unvested Cash so
deposited into the Representative Expense Fund on behalf of any such Company
Stockholder shall vest prior to any Unvested Cash payable under this
Agreement in respect of any Unvested Company Capital Stock held by such
Company Stockholder that is not so deposited into the Representative Expense
Fund). The Representative Expense Amount shall be held and distributed
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Representative shall
hold the Representative Expense Fund as partial security for the reimbursement
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this

 Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.
Following the expiration of the Survival Period in accordance with its terms
and the satisfaction of any Indemnification Claims outstanding at such
expiration, the Representative shall transfer any amounts remaining in the
Representative Expense Fund to the Paying Agent to be distributed to the
Indemnifying Parties upon the terms and conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 8_.

(d) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company shall mail to
each Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (a " _Stockholder Transmittal Letter_ "), which
shall (A) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to a certificate(s) representing shares of the Company Capital Stock that are
being converted into the right to receive payment pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)(i)_ (each, a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") shall pass only upon
delivery of such certificate(s) to the Paying Agent after the Effective Time,
(B) be in such form and have such other reasonable provisions not inconsistent
with this Agreement as Parent and the Representative may specify, (C) include
IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN or any successor form and, where required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (D) include instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificate(s) for that portion of
the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Capital Stock represented thereby under this Agreement. The payment of
the appropriate Closing Payment (as defined below) to any holder of Company
Common Stock is expressly conditioned upon the execution and delivery of
a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, properly completed and duly executed by
each such Company Stockholder. After the Effective Time, and within two (2)
business days after the Paying Agent receives a Company Stock Certificate,
together with a properly completed and duly executed Stockholder Transmittal
Letter, the Paying Agent shall pay to such Company Stockholder that portion of
the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration (determined, solely for purposes of
this  _Section 2.9(d)(i)_, as if the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration is
equivalent to the Estimated Adjusted Merger Consideration) payable to such
Company Stockholder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in respect
of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Company
Stock Certificate(s), less (w) that portion of the Final Adjusted Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to such Company Stockholder in respect of such
shares of Company Capital Stock that Parent is required to withhold from such
Company Stockholder under applicable Tax withholding laws, if any, (x) that
portion of the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such
Company Stockholder in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock that
Parent is entitled to withhold pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ and deliver to
the Escrow Agent to fund the Escrow Fund, (y) that portion of the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such Company Stockholder
in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock that Parent is entitled to
withhold pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_ and deliver to the Representative to
fund the Representative Expense Fund, and (z) that portion of the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such Company Stockholder in
respect of Unvested Company Capital Stock that Parent is entitled to withhold
pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)(ii)_ (such amount less such deductions, with
respect to each such Company Stockholder, being referred to herein as the "
_Closing Payment_ "), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any portion of the applicable Closing
Payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Person requesting such payment (A) shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered,
and shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has
been paid, or (B) shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8(c)_, each Company  



 

18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Stock Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock
shall be deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive
the applicable Final Adjusted Merger Consideration, if any, in respect of
such shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in the manner provided herein.

(ii) Prior to the Closing, each Stock Restriction Agreement shall have been
amended in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit F_ (the "
_Stock Restriction Agreement Amendment_ ") to provide that (A) all Unvested
Cash otherwise payable under this Agreement to a Company Stockholder that is a
party to such Stock Restriction Agreement shall be withheld by Parent in
order to secure Parents repurchase rights under the Stock Restriction
Agreement applicable to such Company Stockholders Unvested Company Capital
Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and after giving effect
to any acceleration of vesting that occurs as a result of the consummation of
the Merger), (B) upon the vesting of any such Unvested Cash in accordance with
the terms of such Stock Restriction Agreement Amendment, any such cash that
is required to be deposited into the Escrow Fund to satisfy the escrow
contribution obligations of such Company Stockholder under this Agreement
shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund (to the extent not previously
deposited into the Escrow Fund by Parent at Parents election) and any
remaining portion of such cash shall be paid to such Company Stockholder, and
(C) at the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the rights and obligations of
the Company under, and be entitled to enforce the provisions of, such Stock
Restriction Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, any
Final Adjusted Merger Consideration otherwise payable to a Company
Stockholder that is Unvested Cash shall be payable to such Company Stockholder
only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Restriction
Agreement Amendment to which such Company Stockholder is a party. The payout
of the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Unvested Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (and after giving effect
to any acceleration of vesting that occurs as a result of the consummation of
the Merger) shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements
that were applicable to such shares of Unvested Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (and after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting that occurs as a result of the consummation of the
Merger), subject to the terms of the applicable agreement governing such
shares and the Stock Restriction Agreement Amendment. Therefore, any Unvested
Cash otherwise payable to a Company Stockholder under this Agreement in
respect of Unvested Company Capital Stock shall not be paid by Parent or the
Paying Agent at the Effective Time, and shall instead be paid by Parent (or
Paying Agent) to such Company Stockholder only on the date that the shares of
Unvested Company Capital Stock that were converted into such Unvested Cash
would have become vested under the vesting schedule in effect in respect of
such Unvested Company shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time
(after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that occurs as a result of
the consummation of the Merger and subject to the restrictions and other terms
of such vesting schedule), less the amount of Unvested Cash deposited into
the Escrow Fund pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_ and the
Representative Expense Fund pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
2.8(c)_; _provided, however_ , that Parent may in its discretion make all
such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash on the last business day of
each calendar month during which vesting occurs for administrative
convenience. All amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section 2.9(d)(ii)_
shall be subject to any required Tax withholding obligations and shall be paid
without interest. A portion of such newly vested cash so distributed will be
treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested
Cash, or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other
than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of such  



 

19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash in
accordance with this Agreement.

(e) _Post-Closing Payment Based on Final Adjusted Merger Consideration_.

(i) If the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Adjusted Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then as
soon as reasonably practicable following the determination of the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8_ (and in any event
within three (3) business days thereafter), (A) Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay to each former Company Stockholder an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to their pro rata portion of the Excess Amount. Such payment
is expressly conditioned upon the execution and delivery of a
Stockholder Transmittal Letter properly completed and duly executed by such
Company Stockholder, and (B) the number of shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock issuable upon exercise, and the exercise price, of each Assumed Option
then outstanding shall be adjusted and recalculated in the manner
contemplated by _Section 2.7(c)(i)_ to reflect the Option Exchange Ratio
derived from the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration.

(ii) If the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Adjusted Merger Consideration (such difference, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "),
as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination of the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8_ (and in any event
within three (3) business days thereafter), (A) Parent and the Representative
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the Escrow
Fund and deliver to Parent an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the Shortfall Amount, by (y) the Escrow Participant Share
(calculated as of the date of such release). In this event, each Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have contributed a pro rata portion of such payment
to Parent from their respective allocated portion of the Escrow Fund, and (B)
the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise,
and the exercise price, of each Assumed Option then outstanding shall be
adjusted and recalculated in the manner contemplated by _Section
2.7(c)(i)_ to reflect the Option Exchange Ratio derived from the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration.

(f) _Termination of Closing Payment Fund; No Liability_. At any time
following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it all or any portion of
the Closing Payment Fund (including any earnings received with
respect thereto) that has not been disbursed to holders of Company Capital
Stock, and thereafter such holders of Company Capital Stock shall be entitled
to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Legal Requirements), and only as general creditors thereof, with
respect to the applicable Final Adjusted Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Company Capital
Stock for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Capital Stock two years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from  



 

20 ##### Table of Contents

  

 the payment of any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any
Person under this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any other applicable
Legal Requirements, unless such Person provides Parent with such documentation
as Parent reasonably requests to qualify for an exemption to any such
requirement to withhold or an approval or certification from the applicable
tax authorities instructing Parent otherwise. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid by the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent to the applicable Tax authorities on behalf
of the holders of Company Capital Stock, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate(s)
which formerly represented shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of (a) an affidavit of
that fact by the Company Stockholder in form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent (a " _Lost Stock Affidavit_ "), Parent shall instruct the Paying
Agent to pay such Company Stockholder the portion of the Final Adjusted Merger
Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled to pursuant to 
_Section 2.7(a)_; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its sole
discretion (acting in good faith) and as a condition precedent to issuing such
instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate(s) or agreements to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to the certificate(s) or agreements alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed (the " _Lost Certificate Indemnity Agreement_ ").

 2.10 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of
the shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.
After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
cancel and exchange, as provided in this  _Section 2.10_, any presented
certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding

(x) such former stockholders Company Stockholder Pro Rata Percentage, by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Company Stockholder Escrow Amount

multiplying (x) such former option holders Company Option Holder Pro Rata
Percentage, by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Company Option
Holder Escrow Amount and the denominator of which is Escrow Amount.

Pursuant to and as a result of the foregoing pro rata allocations, Parent
acknowledges and hereby agrees (for and on behalf of all Parent Indemnified
Parties) that, in the event the Parent Indemnified

 Parties (or any of them) shall be entitled to recover funds from the Escrow
Fund in respect of an Indemnification Claim pursuant to  _Section 8.2(a)_

the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover the full
amount of such Indemnification Claim unless and until all such
Assumed Options have been exercised in full.

in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than Indemnification Claims pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ix)_ __,
which are addressed by the first clause of this _Section 8.2(c)(iv)_).

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any
Indemnification Claims under or pursuant to clauses (i) of  _Section 8.2(a)_
unless and until all Damages directly or indirectly paid, sustained or
incurred against by the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them) exceeds
One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the " _Damage
Threshold_ ") in the aggregate, and if the aggregate of all Damages directly
or indirectly paid, sustained or incurred against by the Parent Indemnified
Parties (or any of them) exceeds the Damage Threshold, then the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for all
such Damages in excess of the Damage Threshold; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the preceding restriction set forth in this 
_Section 8.2(c)(v)_ shall not in any way limit or otherwise restrict any
right in respect of Indemnification Claims pursuant to clauses (ii)(ix) of

Indemnifying Party relative to the total Final Adjusted Merger Consideration
received by all Indemnifying Parties.

(d) _Indemnification Claims_.

(i) If a Parent Indemnified Party is of the opinion that it has or may

or any officer thereof (each, an " _Officer s Certificate_"): (i) stating
that such Parent Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly paid, sustained
or incurred any Damages, or reasonably anticipates that it will directly or
indirectly pay, sustain or incur any Damages, (ii) specifying in reasonable
detail the individual items of Damages included in the amount so stated (and
the method of computation of each such item of Damages, if applicable), the
date each such item of Damages was paid, sustained or incurred, or the basis
for such reasonably anticipated Damages, (iii) a brief description in

the identity and address of any third-party claimant and copies of any formal
demand or complaint relating thereto, and (iv) the basis for indemnification
under _Section 8.2_ to which such item of Damages is related (including, if

(ii) If the Representative shall not object in writing pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)(iv)_ to any individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers
Certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)(i)_ within thirty
(30) calendar days after the Representatives receipt of such Officers
Certificate, the Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have
acknowledged and irrevocably consented, for and on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, (i) to the Parent Indemnified Party recovery of the full amount of
all such items of Damages set forth in such Officers Certificate solely to
the extent that such Damages do not exceed the Escrow Amount at such time and
subject to the limitations set forth herein, and (ii) if and to the extent
necessary, and without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a
final judgment for damages against the Indemnifying Parties for such items of
Damages in any court having competent jurisdiction over the matter. Upon
receipt of any Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not release any
portion of the Escrow Amount to Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party
or Parties pursuant to this Agreement unless and until (i) the Escrow Agent
shall have received written authorization from the Representative to release
any portion of the Escrow Amount, or (ii) the Representative shall have failed
to object in writing pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)(iv)_ to any individual items
of Damages set forth in such Officers Certificate within thirty (30)
calendar days after the Representatives receipt of such Officers
Certificate.

(iii) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall receive written authorization
from the Representative to release to Parent or any other Parent Indemnified
Party or Parties any portion of the Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)(i)_, the Escrow Agent shall release such portion of the Escrow Amount
in accordance with such written instructions. In the event that the
Representative shall have failed to object in writing pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)(iv)_ to any individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers
Certificate relating to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_
within thirty (30) calendar days after the Representatives receipt of such
Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release to Parent or
any other Parent Indemnified Party or Parties (as instructed by Parent in
writing) from the Escrow Fund an amount of cash equal to the amount of all
such items of Damages specified in such Officers Certificate with respect to
which the Representative has not objected in writing pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)(iv)_. Any cash released to Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party
or Parties pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be deemed to reduce
each Indemnifying Partys interest in the Escrow Fund in accordance with his,
her or its pro rata portion of the Escrow Fund.

(iv) In the event that the Representative shall seek to contest any
individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers Certificate received
from Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)(i)_, the Representative shall notify
Parent in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such
Officers Certificate, of the Representatives objection, which notice shall
set forth a brief description in reasonable detail of the Representatives
basis for objecting to each item of Damages based on the Representatives
good faith belief thereof. Upon Parents receipt of a written notice of
objection from the Representative pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent
and the Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to the disputed items of Damages. If
the Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth the
agreement reached by the parties with respect to such disputed items of
Damages shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the instructions set
forth in any such memorandum.

(v) If within sixty (60) days after the Representatives receipt of such
Officers Certificate, and after good faith negotiations, the parties are
unable to agree on the rights of the respective parties with respect to any
disputed items of Damages set forth in an Officers

 Certificate, either Parent or the Representative may bring suit in the
courts identified in _Section 10.9_ to resolve the matter. The decision
of the trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officers Certificate shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with such decision and the Escrow Agent shall distribute the
Escrow Amount in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
trial court may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(e) _Company Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement,
the Charter or Bylaws of the Company, or in any agreement between the Company
and any Stockholder to the contrary entered into prior to the Closing, in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation, as the successor in interest to the
Company by virtue of the Merger, or Parent, be obligated to reimburse,
contribute, indemnify or hold harmless any Company Stockholder in its
capacity as a Company Stockholder for or in connection with any Damages or
obligations of the Company under this _ARTICLE 8_.

(f) _Third Party Actions_. In the event any Action is instituted against a
Parent Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely
to involve an Indemnification Claim hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
Parent will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the
Representative (and, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of the
commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Representative (and, in the
event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party) of the commencement of any such Action will
relieve the Indemnifying Parties from liability in connection therewith only
if and to the extent that such failure materially and adversely affects the
ability of the Indemnifying Parties to defend their interests in such Action.
Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to control the defense or
settlement of such Action; _provided, however_ , that the Representative (or,
in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) and its counsel (at such partys
sole expense) may participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense
of such Action; and _provided further_ that, except with the consent of the
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party), which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, no settlement of any such Action with
third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Damages
relating to such matter. In the event that the Representative has consented to
any such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority
to object under any provision of this ARTICLE 8 to the amount of any such
Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Fund, or against the Indemnifying
Parties directly, as the case may be, with respect to such settlement.

(g) _Definition of Damages_. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the
term " _Damages_ " shall mean the amount of (i) any direct, indirect,
consequential, incidental or other damage (including lost profits and
diminution in value), loss, liability, claim, deficiency, Tax, judgment, fine,
penalty, cost or other expense (including reasonable attorneys, consultants
and experts fees and expenses) directly or indirectly paid, sustained or
incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them), (ii) any and all
reasonable fees and costs of enforcing the Parent Indemnified Partys rights
under this Agreement, and (iii) any and all reasonable fees and costs
defending any Third Party Actions. For purposes of determining the amount of
any Damage suffered or incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party,
any qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants with
respect to a Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality, material or similar
terms shall be disregarded and will not have any effect with respect to the
calculation of the amount of any Damages attributable to a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of

 the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any of the ancillary
agreements, exhibits, schedules or certificates to, or delivered in connection
with this Agreement.

(h) _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Indemnifying Parties, the
Representative and Parent agree to treat (and cause their affiliates to
treat) any payments received pursuant to _Section 8.2_ as adjustments to the
Final Adjusted Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum
extent permitted by Legal Requirements.

(i) _Effect of Investigation; Reliance_. The right to indemnification, payment
of Damages or any other remedy hereunder will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or
on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will
not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or any other
remedy based on any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No
Parent Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any
representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such
Parent Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification hereunder. Parent
and the Company each acknowledge that such Damages, if any, would relate to
unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at
the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the Final Adjusted Merger
Consideration that Parent would have paid in connection with the Merger.

8.3 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except any claims or causes of actions under
applicable law arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the
Company (or any of its agents) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than Indemnification Claims pursuant
to _Section 8.2(a)(ix)_ __, which are addressed by _Section 8.2(c)(iv)_),
if the Merger is consummated, the indemnification remedies set forth in this
_ARTICLE 8_ shall be the exclusive remedy of any Parent Indemnified Party for
any breach by the Company of this Agreement or any agreement, document,
schedule, certificate or other instrument required to be delivered by the
Company under or pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

8.4 _Representative_. Each of the Company Stockholders and Indemnifying
Parties, by approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereunder, hereby appoints the Representative as his, her or its true and
lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact, to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement on their behalf and exercise all or any of
the powers, authority and discretion conferred on him or her under this
Agreement.

(a) _Powers of the Representative_. 

(i) The Representative shall have and may exercise all of the powers conferred
upon him or her pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which

pursuant to and in the manner contemplated by _Section 2.8_;

court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which notice must be given
to each Indemnifying Party individually, as applicable), and to take any and
all action for and on behalf of Indemnifying Parties, and each of them, under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other such agreement, document or
instrument;

(D) The power (subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_) to contest,
negotiate, defend, compromise or settle any Indemnification Claims or Actions
for which a Parent Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification
through counsel selected by the Representative and solely at the cost, risk
and expense of the Indemnifying Parties, authorize payment to any Parent
Indemnified Party of any of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, in
satisfaction of any Indemnification Claims, agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such Indemnification
Claims, resolve any Indemnification Claims, take any actions in
connection with the resolution of any dispute relating hereto or to the
transactions contemplated hereby by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and
take or forego any or all actions permitted or required of any Indemnifying
Party or necessary in the judgment of the Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(E) The power to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Parties;

(F) The power to review, negotiate and agree to and authorize any payments
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any payment obligation, in each
case, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, as contemplated thereunder;

(G) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Indemnifying Parties
(other than the payment of the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein); and

(H) The power to take any actions in regard to such other matters as are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and in the Escrow Agreement or as the Representative
reasonably believes are in the best interests of the Indemnifying Parties;

_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth herein, the powers conferred above shall not authorize or
empower the Representative to do or cause to be done any of the foregoing (i)
in a manner that improperly discriminates between or among the Indemnifying
Parties; or (ii) as to any matter insofar as such matter relates solely and
exclusively to a single Indemnifying Party, whereupon the Representative may
appoint the Indemnifying Party who is alleged to be in breach to handle all
matters related to such indemnification claim on behalf  



 

73 ##### Table of Contents

  

 of the Representative, and all references to the Representative in such
event shall include also such Indemnifying Party. Without implying that other
actions would constitute an improper discrimination, each of the Indemnifying
Parties agrees that discrimination between or among Indemnifying Parties
solely on the basis of the respective number of shares of Company Capital
Stock held by each Company Stockholder shall not be deemed to be improper.
Further, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Representative
shall not be entitled to, and shall not, take any action that would or could
(i) cause any Indemnifying Partys liability hereunder to exceed its portion
of the Escrow Amount, (ii) result in the amounts payable hereunder to any
Indemnifying Party being distributed in any manner other than as set forth in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (iii) result in an increase of
any Indemnifying Partys indemnity or other obligations or liabilities under
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any change to the
nature of the indemnity obligations), without (in each case) such
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

(b) _Representations of Representative_. The Representative hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

(i) The Representative has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to carry out his, her
or its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of the Representative, enforceable against the
Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity principles.

(iii) The Escrow Agreement will be duly executed and delivered by the
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
the Escrow Agreement by Parent and the Escrow Agent, constitute a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Representative, enforceable against the
Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity
principles.

the information in his or her possession) to the Indemnifying Parties. As soon
as possible thereafter, the Representative shall notify the Indemnifying
Parties of the proposed action which the Representative recommends shall be
taken in response to such Indemnification Claim.

(ii) The Representative shall have the discretion to take such action as he or
she shall determine to be in the best interest of all of the Indemnifying
Parties, including authorizing the distribution to any Parent Indemnified
Party of any portion of the Escrow Fund; _provided, however_ , that, in any
event, all Indemnifying Parties are treated in substantially the same manner.

(d) _Notices_. Any notice given to the Representative will constitute notice
to each and all of the Indemnifying Parties at the time notice is given to the
Representative. Any  



 

74 ##### Table of Contents

  

 action taken by, or notice or instruction received from, the Representative
will be deemed to be action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all
of the Indemnifying Parties. Except as otherwise contained herein, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation may, and the Escrow
Agent will, disregard any notice or instruction received from any one or more
individual Indemnifying Parties.

(e) _Agreement of the Representative_. The Representative hereby agrees to do
such acts, and execute further documents, as shall be necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(f) _Reimbursement and Liability of Representative_.

(i) At the Closing, the Representative Expense Amount shall be deducted from
the amounts due to each holder of Company Capital Stock pursuant to _Section
2.8(c)_ and transferred to the Representative to be held in an account
separate from that in which any other funds are held, as an expense fund to
cover such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative
in the performance of his or her duties hereunder. Any remaining funds not
used by the Representative shall be paid to the Company Stockholders
contributing to such fund, on a pro rata basis, upon conclusion of
the Representatives duties hereunder. However, in any event (and
particularly in the event that the Representative Expense Fund is not
sufficient to cover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Representative in the performance of his or her duties hereunder), each
Indemnifying Party agrees that such Indemnifying Partys pro rata share of
such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that are not covered by the
Representative Expense Fund may be deducted by the Representative from
amounts distributed to the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, from the Escrow Fund prior to delivery of such Escrow Fund to the
Indemnifying Parties.

(ii) The Representative shall not be personally liable as the Representative
to any Indemnifying Party for any act done or omitted hereunder
as Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment. The Indemnifying Parties shall severally (but not
jointly) indemnify the Representative and hold the Representative harmless
against any Damages incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Representatives duties hereunder.

8.5 _Reliance on Representative_. Parent and its respective affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the appointment of Steve Spurlock as
Representative and treat such Representative as the duly appointed attorney-
in-fact of each Indemnifying Party and as having the duties, power and
authority provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. None of
Parent or its respective affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) or the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any
Indemnifying Party for any actions taken or omitted by them in reliance upon
any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the Representative.
No resignation of the Representative shall become effective unless at least
thirty (30) days prior written notice of the replacement or resignation of
such Representative shall be provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Parent
and its respective affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely at any
time after receipt of any such notice on the most recent notice so received.
The Indemnifying Parties holding a majority interest in the Escrow Fund held
in escrow at such time may remove the Representative by a written instrument
delivered to the Representative, Parent and the Company, and, in such event
and also if the Representative shall be unable or unwilling to serve in such
capacity, his, her or its  



 

75 ##### Table of Contents

  

 successor who shall serve and exercise the powers of the Representative
hereunder shall be appointed by a written instrument signed by Indemnifying
Parties holding a majority interest in the Escrow Fund held in escrow at such
time and delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent.

(f) by the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement such that, if not cured on or prior to
the Closing Date, the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured in all
material respects within twenty-five (25) calendar days after written notice
thereof to Parent; _provided, however_ , that no cure period shall be required
for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured; or 

(g) by Parent, if Stockholder Written Consents representing the Requisite
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained by the Company and
delivered to Parent within one (1) hour immediately following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or their respective officers, directors or stockholders;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement,
following any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, any
party hereto shall remain liable thereafter for any claims or causes of action
under applicable law arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation by
such party (or any of its agents) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that occurred prior to such termination; and
_provided further_ , that, the provisions of _Section 6.7_ (Public
Announcements), _Section 6.9_ (Fees and Expenses), this  _Section 9.2_ and
_ARTICLE 10_ shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this _ARTICLE 9_.

9.3 _Amendments; No Waiver_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective
Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in
the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or, in the case of
a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided
however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 9.3_, the Company Stockholders
agree that any amendment or waiver of the Agreement signed by the
Representative shall be binding upon and effective against each of the
Company Stockholders whether or not they have signed such amendment or waiver.
No course of dealing and no failure or delay on the part of any party hereto
in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such partys rights,
powers and remedies. The failure of any of the parties to this Agreement to
require the performance of a term or obligation under this Agreement or the
waiver by any of the parties to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall
not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a
waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than Indemnification
