 **AGREEMENT OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION**

 

 This Agreement of Merger and Reorganization ("Agreement") is made and entered into effective as of October 17, 2005, by and among Steel Dynamics, Inc., an Indiana corporation ("Parent"), RS Acquisition Corporation, an Indiana corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), and Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation, a Virginia corporation ("Company" and collectively, with Parent and Merger Subsidiary, the "parties").

 

 This Agreement is made and entered into under the following circumstances:

     | **(a)**  |   The boards of directors of Parent, Company, and
Merger Subsidiary believe it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and their stockholders that Company and Merger Subsidiary engage
in a business combination through the statutory merger of Company with and
into the Merger Subsidiary ("Merger"), in order to advance the long-term
strategic business interests of the Company and Parent.  
---|---|--- 
       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    | **(b)**  |   The board of directors of the Company (i) determined
that this Agreement, the Merger, the Plan of Merger and the transactions
contemplated herein and therein (the "Transactions") are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and the Company stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger, the Plan of Merger and the
Transactions, and (iii) recommended approval and adoption of this Agreement,
the Merger, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions, by the
Company stockholders.  
       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    | **(c)**  |   The boards of directors of Parent, and Merger
Subsidiary have approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

defined in Section 2.1(a), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as defined in Section 1.3, other than shares owned or held
directly or indirectly by Parent or by Merger Subsidiary or directly or
indirectly by the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration described in Section 2.1(a).  
       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    | **(e)**  |   For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of §368(a) of

promulgated thereunder.  
       |   |   
---|---|---

the execution of this Agreement, (1) two members of the senior management of
the Company are entering into new employment agreements with the Parent and

       |    |    |   **(a)**  |  At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of Company's no par value common stock ("Company Shares") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including those Company Shares
subject to restricted stock awards that become non-forfeitable and fully
transferable by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereunder ("Restricted
Company Shares"), (other than Company Shares owned or held directly or
indirectly by Parent or by Merger Subsidiary or directly or indirectly by the
Company, all of which shall be canceled as provided in Section 2.1(d)), shall
be converted into the right to receive:  
---|---|---|---|--- 
       |   |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |    |    |    |   **(i)**  |  0.400 shares of Parent's
common stock ("Parent Common Stock"), par value $0.01 per share (the "Per
Share Stock Consideration"), and  
       |   |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |    |    |    |   **(ii)**  |  $9.75 in cash, without
interest (the "Per Share Cash Consideration" and, together with the "Per Share
Stock Consideration," the "Merger Consideration"), together with any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.7.  
       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
     |    |    |   **(b)**  |  The nature and amount of the Merger
Consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market

       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
     |    |    |   **(c)**  |  Each issued and outstanding Company
Share (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(d)),
hereof shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares

retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Share, whether
held as book-entry or by a certificate representing any such Company Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with the terms hereof.  
       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  |  | **(d)**  |   Each Company Share owned by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, or held by the
Company at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be

   |   **2.2** **Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based
Awards.**   
     |     
---|--- 
     |    |    |   **(a)**  |  Each unexercised option to purchase
Company Shares ("Company Stock Options") granted pursuant to any stock option
plans or other equity-related compensation plans of the Company described in
Section 3.5(a) ("Company Stock Option Plans"), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent a right to acquire Company Shares and shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, into an option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under each particular Company
Stock Option and in accordance with any changes to such terms required
pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Option or the Company Stock Option
Plans by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or
as required pursuant to Section 2.2(e) below. The number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each converted Company Stock Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Company Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by 0.7389 (the "Exchange
Ratio"), rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock, and such converted Company Stock Option shall have an exercise price
per share (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share exercise
price specified in such Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code,
or (2) to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code and applicable
Treasury Department guidance thereunder to prevent the converted Company Stock
Option from being treated as the grant of a new stock option, the option
price, the number of shares subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and, as
applicable, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. On or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will take all necessary actions for the adjustment
of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.2(a), including, but not
limited to, precluding the holder of each Company Stock Option from receiving
any cash payments in respect of such Company Stock Options in connection with
the Merger.  
---|---|---|---|--- 
       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |    |    |   **(b)**  |  At the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume each Company Stock Option Plan and each Company Stock Option in
accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan under which it was
issued and the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, but no later than two (2) Business Days,
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock
Options written notices confirming each such holders' rights pursuant to the
Company Stock Option Plans and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
which each holder is entitled and the exercise price thereof, but in all other
respects the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options
and the remaining terms and conditions shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions as existed prior to the Effective Time and in accordance
with any changes to such terms required pursuant to the terms of the Company
Stock Option or the Company Stock Option Plans by reason of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, or as required pursuant to Section
2.2(d) below.

    |    |    |   **(c)**  |  Prior to the Closing, (i) Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company
Stock Options, and (ii) the Company shall take all corporate action, if any,

Section 6.2(b), this Section 6.4(b) and Section 6.4(c), or (iii) to engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide information to, any Person in

Person, but if and only to the extent that: (A) with respect to the actions
contemplated by _clause_ (ii) of this Section 6.4(b), (x) such Change in the
Company Recommendation is made pursuant to Sections 6.2(b), this Section
6.4(b) and Section 6.4(c), and (y) the Company has received an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party and the Company's
Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a "Superior Proposal" (as defined below), or (B) in the case of

consultation with its financial advisers and outside legal counsel, concludes
in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition
Proposal could result in a Superior Proposal. Furthermore, in the case of
_clause_ (iii), prior to providing any further information or data to
any Person, or entering into any discussions or negotiations with any Person,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such inquiries, proposals, or
offers from any such Person, or of any discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated, continued or resumed with any such Person, together with the
material terms and conditions of any of such inquiries, proposals, discussions
or offers. The Company agrees that it will thereafter promptly keep Parent
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the
status and terms of any such discussions or negotiations.

     |  |  | For purposes of this Agreement,  a "Superior Proposal"
means, with respect to the Company, a bona  fide written proposal made by a
third party which is (i) for a sale, lease,  exchange, transfer or other
disposition of at least 50% of the assets of  the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction  or a series of
related transactions, or (ii) for the acquisition, directly  or indirectly,
by such third party of beneficial ownership of 50% or more  of the Company
Shares, whether by merger, consolidation, share exchange,  business
combination, tender or exchange offer, or otherwise, and which is  otherwise
on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith  concludes
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal  counsel),
taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,  regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal, the third party making the  proposal and
any other proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement  and the
Merger, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more 
favorable to its stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders), from  a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  and, further, is reasonably capable of being completed as such.

obligation with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment prior
to the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that it is required to make a
Change in the Company Recommendation, as permitted by the terms of Sections
6.2(b), Section 6.4(b) and this Section 6.4(c), and in order to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders under the VSCA,
the Company Board may make a Change in the Company Recommendation.
