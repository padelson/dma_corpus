remedy in respect of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation).

   8.10 |

Subject to paragraph 14 of Schedule 7, the rights and remedies of the Buyer in
respect of any breach of this Agreement shall not be affected by the

Buyer or its advisers except where the Buyer has given a specific waiver or
release and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Disclosure

Traffic in Arms Regulations as amended. The relevant exclusions, limitations

     | (i) |

one of the Group Companies or the Buyer discharges or has discharged such
Taxation by direct payment to the relevant Tax Authority and the relevant Tax
  

---|---|--- 



 

19  Authority confirms that such payment removes, discharges or otherwise
eliminates the liability of ECI; 

---|--- 


     | (ii) |

an amount in respect of such Tax Liability has previously been paid to ECI; 

---|---|--- 


     | (iii) |

such Tax Liability has been recovered under section 767B(2) ICTA or any other
relevant statutory provision, and ECI undertakes to ensure and procure that no
such recovery is sought under clause 10.1 of this Agreement to the extent
that payment has been made in respect of the Tax Liability; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

such Tax Liability is or could be subject to a valid claim by the Buyer under
the Tax Deed and in respect of which the Warrantors have not previously made
payment.  

---|---|--- 



   10.2 |

The covenant contained in clause 10.1 shall extend to the reasonable costs and

references to the "Buyer" to "ECI" and making any other
necessary modifications.

   11 |

Guarantee

   11.1 |

In consideration of the Sellers and Barclays entering into this Agreement, the
Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally:

guarantees to the Sellers and Barclays the due and punctual performance and
discharge by the Buyer of all its obligations and liabilities (including
without limitation the obligation to pay the Initial Consideration, to pay
the amount payable to the Sellers pursuant to clause 17.2 and to pay any other
monies) under this Agreement and all documents to be executed pursuant to this
Agreement (together, the "Guaranteed Obligations") and agrees to pay on
demand from time to time each sum which the Buyer is liable to pay under this
Agreement and all documents to be executed pursuant to this Agreement; and 

---|---|--- 


     | (b) |

Guaranteed Obligations are not recoverable from the Guarantor under the
guarantee in clause 11.1(a) for any reason the Guarantor will be liable to
the Sellers and Barclays as a principal debtor by way of indemnity for the
same amount as that for which it would have been liable had those Guaranteed
Obligations been recoverable and further agrees to discharge that liability
on demand from time to time. 

---|---|--- 



   11.2 |

This Guarantee shall be a continuing obligation and shall continue in force
and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations have lapsed or have been paid,
discharged or satisfied in full and notwithstanding any bankruptcy of the
Buyer. The Sellers and Barclays may make claims and demands of the Guarantor
without limit in number. 

---|--- 


   11.3 |

The obligations and liabilities expressed to be undertaken by the Guarantor
under this Guarantee are those of primary obligor and not merely as a
surety.  

---|--- 



   11.4 |

to make, demand, enforce or seek to enforce any claim, right or remedy against
the Buyer and any other person. 

---|---|--- 


   11.5 |

This Guarantee shall be in addition to and shall not affect or be affected by
or merge with any other judgment, security, right or remedy obtained or held
by the Sellers or Barclays from time to time for the discharge and
performance of any of the liabilities and obligations of the Guarantor to the
Sellers or Barclays, and the Guarantor will not be released or discharged from
any of his obligations under this Guarantee, nor will any of such obligations
be affected by: 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

the giving of time or the granting of any other indulgence or concession by
the Sellers or Barclays to the Buyer or any other person; 

---|---|--- 


     | (b) |

other person or any sale or transfer of the whole or any part of the

     | (c) |

the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may
have against the Buyer, the Sellers or Barclays or any other person, or which
the Buyer may have against the Sellers or Barclays, whether in connection
with any Guaranteed Obligation or otherwise; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

any other fact or matter or thing done or omitted to be done by the Sellers or
Barclays (other than a written release of this Guarantee) or any other person
which, but for this provision, might operate to exonerate or discharge the
Guarantor from, or otherwise prejudice or affect, any of the Guarantors
obligations under this Guarantee. 

---|---|--- 


   11.6 |

The Sellers and Barclays rights under this Guarantee will not be prejudiced
by any delay in exercising them or by any other act done or omitted by the
Sellers and Barclays which but for this clause might have been deemed a
waiver of such rights nor will any exercise of any such right preclude any
further exercise of such right or any other right.
