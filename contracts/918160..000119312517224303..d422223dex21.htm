<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The undersigned, in his capacity as an officer of AK Steel Corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers,
e-mail addresses and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1 identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of Parent, and that
the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 is the security procedure selected by Parent for use in verifying that a funds transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of Parent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parent has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 best meets its requirements;
given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in Part III of this Exhibit B-1, Parent acknowledges that it has elected to not use the other security procedures
described and agrees to be bound by any funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular security procedure chosen by Parent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>NOTICE</U>: The security procedure selected by Parent will not be used to detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Parent. If a funds
transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently by name and account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. If a funds transfer
instruction describes a participating financial institution inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution. Therefore, it is important that
Parent take such steps as it deems prudent to ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The undersigned, in his capacity as an officer of Members&#146; Representative, certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers, e-mail
addresses and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-2 identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of Members&#146;
Representative, and that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-2 is the security procedure selected by Members&#146; Representative for use in verifying that a funds transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of
Members&#146; Representative. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Members&#146; Representative has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that the
option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-2 best meets its requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in Part III of this Exhibit B-2,
Members&#146; Representative acknowledges that it has elected to not use the other security procedures described and agrees to be bound by any funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the Escrow Agent
in compliance with the particular security procedure chosen by Members&#146; Representative. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>NOTICE</U>: The security procedure
selected by Members&#146; Representative will not be used to detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Members&#146; Representative. If a funds transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently by name and
account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. If a funds transfer instruction describes a participating financial institution inconsistently by name and
identification number, the identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution. Therefore, it is important that Members&#146; Representative take such steps as it deems prudent to ensure that there are
no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Part I </B></P>
