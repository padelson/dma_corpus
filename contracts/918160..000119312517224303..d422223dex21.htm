Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the Companys estimates of
the Purchase Price, the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount, the
amount of any Company Transaction Expenses that remain unpaid as of

Amount. The Company shall not take any action outside of the ordinary course
of business for the purpose of varying the amount of cash and cash

Capital between the close of business on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date and the time of Closing. Prior to Closing, Parent and its
representatives shall have the right to review and comment upon each such
estimate. In connection therewith, the Company shall make its representatives
reasonably available to Parent and its representatives during the three (3)
Business Days referenced in the first sentence of this _Section 2.13_ to
respond to any questions or reasonable requests that Parent may have with
respect to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or the Estimated Closing
Statement (including by making available to Parent and its representatives,
during normal business hours, those members of senior management of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who are familiar with the accounting and
financial books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared on a basis consistent with
the Applicable Accounting Principles, and the estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount calculation reflected in the Estimated Closing Statement
will be prepared on a basis consistent with the Working Capital Calculation
Schedule and the definitions of Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, in each case, as set forth herein.

 

(b) _Closing Balance Sheet_. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after
the Closing Date, Parent will, at Parents sole cost and expense, prepare,
and will provide to the Members Representative, a balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), together with a written statement setting forth in
reasonable detail Parents proposed final determination of the Purchase Price,
the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount, the amount of all Company
Transaction Expenses that remained unpaid as of immediately prior to the
Closing and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (the " _Proposed Final
Closing Statement_ "). The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles. Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company) and
their respective employees and accountants shall reasonably cooperate with the
Members Representative and its accountants and other representatives in the
Members Representatives review of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the
Proposed Final Closing Statement (including by making available to the
Members Representative for such purposes any employees of Parent and its
Affiliates, including former

 



19  members of the management of the Company and its Subsidiaries, who are
familiar with the accounting and financial books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries). For purposes of such review, Parent and its Affiliates
shall provide the Members Representative and its accountants and other
representatives reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for such purpose.

 

(c) _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed
Final Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
unless the Members Representative provides a written notice (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") to Parent no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after delivery of
the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement
setting forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet and/or the Proposed Final Closing Statement which the Members
Representative disputes or otherwise believes has not been prepared
in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles or this Agreement and
(ii) the alternative amount calculated by the Members Representative with
respect to such item in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles
and this Agreement, and any items not so disputed shall be deemed final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties in all respects.

(d)  _Resolution of Disputes_. If the Members Representative delivers a
Dispute Notice in accordance with _Section 2.13(c)_, Parent and the Members
Representative will attempt to resolve any matters raised in such
Dispute Notice in good faith. If Parent and the Members Representative
resolve the objections set forth in the Dispute Notice within twenty (20)
Business Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the amounts agreed upon by
them in writing shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding upon all
parties in all respects. Beginning on the twentieth (20th) Business Day after
delivery of the Dispute Notice, either Parent or the Members Representative
may provide written notice to the other that it elects to submit the disputed
items set forth in the Dispute Notice that remain unresolved to
PricewaterhouseCoopers or another nationally recognized independent accounting
firm chosen by mutual agreement of the Members Representative and Parent
(the " _Arbitrator_ "). The Arbitrator will promptly, in accordance with the
rules set forth in the Arbitrators engagement letter and its customary
practices, review those unresolved items and amounts set forth and objected
to in the Dispute Notice and resolve all such unresolved disputed items (and
only such unresolved disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) in
accordance with this Agreement. In any such case, a single partner of
the Arbitrator selected by the Arbitrator in accordance with its normal
procedures and having expertise with respect to settlement of such disputes
shall act for the Arbitrator in the determination proceeding, and such partner
shall render a written decision with respect to such unresolved disputed
items, including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for its
decision. The Arbitrators determination shall be based solely on the
submissions and supporting materials provided by Parent and the Members
Representative in accordance with the terms, definitions and procedures set
forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). In
resolving any unresolved disputed item, the Arbitrator may not assign a value
to any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by either
Parent in its calculation pursuant to _Section 2.13(b)_ or the Members
Representative in its Dispute Notice or less than the minimum value for such
item claimed by either such party therein. The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator shall be allocated to be paid by Parent, on the one hand, and the
Members Representative, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party, as determined by the Arbitrator.

 



20  The decision of the Arbitrator with respect to each of the disputed items of
the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Proposed Final Closing Statement
submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. Each of
the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Arbitrator (including by executing a customary
engagement letter reasonably acceptable to the Arbitrator and the parties)
and to cause the Arbitrator to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable
after the commencement of the Arbitrators engagement.

 

(e) _Adjustment Payment_. Promptly, and in any event no later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the final determination of the Purchase Price, the
Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount, the amount of any Company
Transaction Expenses that were unpaid as of immediately prior to Closing and
the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount in accordance with this  _Section
2.13_:

(i) if the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.13_ exceeds the estimated Purchase Price reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement and used for purposes of the Closing Consideration payment pursuant
to _Section 2.10_, then Parent will pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Members Representative such excess, for further
payment to the Members; and

(ii) if the estimated Purchase Price reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement and used for purposes of the Closing Consideration payment pursuant
to _Section 2.10_ exceeds the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.13_, then Parent shall be entitled to recover such excess
from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If,
following the recovery of such excess from the Escrow Account by Parent, there
remains any funds in the Escrow Account in excess of $4,000,000, then
the Members Representative shall be entitled to recover such excess from the
Escrow Account on behalf of the Members pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(f) _Tax Treatment_. The parties will treat any adjustment payment received
pursuant to _Section 2.13(e)_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

(g) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable under this
Agreement such amounts, if any, that are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to any such payments under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign law. Parent shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,
provide to the Members Representative written notice detailing any amounts
required to be deducted or withheld from any amount payable under this
Agreement at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing. Amounts
deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.13(g)_ and properly remitted
to the applicable taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to or
on behalf of the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company License has
occurred and is continuing, and no event has occurred which with notice

Company License has occurred and is continuing, and no event has occurred
which with notice or lapse of time would constitute such a breach or default,

otherwise violated by any third party, nor has been infringed,
misappropriated, or otherwise violated since December 23, 2013, and (iii) no
Action or other proceeding (including cancellation, opposition, re-
examination, or the like) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing, which challenges the legality, validity,
enforceability, use or ownership of the Intellectual Property owned by the

facts or circumstances that would form the basis for any such challenge. The
Company or its Subsidiaries have the right to bring actions for infringement,
misappropriation, unauthorized use, or other violation of the Company Owned
Intellectual Property.

 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect
the confidentiality and value of all the Trade Secrets included in the

"). The Company IT Systems are adequate for, and operate and perform in all
material respects as required in connection with, the operation of the
Business as currently conducted, without material disruptions, adverse effects
on the functionality of the Company IT Systems, or any program, code,
algorithm or device that would enable or assist any Person to access the
Company IT Systems without appropriate authorization. No source code for any
software owned by the Company (" _Company Software_ ") has been delivered,
licensed, or made available to any escrow agent or other third party; and
neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any duty or obligation (whether
present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or make available
the source code for any such Company Software to any escrow agent or other
third party. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, result in the delivery,
license, or disclosure of any source code for any such Company Software to
any other third party. The Company or its Subsidiaries has in its possession
the source code and related technical and other information required to enable
employees or third parties with appropriate skills and knowledge in the

Company Owned Intellectual Property where, as a result of such funding or the
use of such facilities, such entity has any rights in such Company Owned
Intellectual Property.

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not impair the Companys or its Subsidiaries ability to utilize the

part thereof, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to
its qualification under the Code and to the effect that each such trust is
exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred
since the date of such determination letter that will adversely affect such
qualification or tax-exempt status.

basis.

(f) No Company Plan provides for post-employment medical benefits, other than
statutory liability for providing group health plan continuation coverage
under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code
or similar provisions of applicable provincial or state Legal Requirements.

(g) There are no Actions (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Plan
as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, or would reasonably be
expected to have, any material liability.

 

(h) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with
another event): (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due to any
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of, or increase the amount of, compensation or benefits due to any
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or require any contributions or payments
to fund any obligations under any Company Plan or cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any Company Plan, or
(iii) limit or restrict the right to amend, merge, terminate or transfer the
assets of any Company Plan. No Company Plan provides for a "gross-up" of
Taxes incurred under Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code. No Company Plan
subject to Section 409A of the Code has failed, in any material respect, in
form or operation, to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with
another event) will give rise to any payment (or acceleration of vesting of
any amounts or benefits) that will be an "excess parachute payment" as defined
in Section 280G of the Code.

(j) (i) Each Foreign Company Plan, if intended to qualify for special tax
treatment, meets all the requirements for such treatment and nothing has
occurred that will adversely affect such special tax status; (ii) all employer
and employee contributions to each Foreign Company Plan required by its terms
or by applicable Legal Requirements have been made or, if applicable, accrued
in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the applicable
jurisdiction and any other payments (including insurance premiums) otherwise
due in respect of a Foreign Company Plan have been paid in full; (iii) the
fair market value of the assets

 



42  of each funded Foreign Company Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Company Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established
for any Foreign Company Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of
the date of this Agreement, with respect to all current and former
participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions
and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign Company Plan, and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall
cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit
obligations; and (iv) each Foreign Company Plan required or intended to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
each applicable Governmental Authority and nothing has occurred that will
adversely affect such registered status. For each Foreign Multiemployer Group
Benefits Plan with respect to which Company or its Subsidiaries may have any
liability or contingent liability, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all of their respective obligations under the terms of such
Foreign Multiemployer Group Benefits Plan, any other agreement concerning such
plan and applicable Legal Requirements, including with respect to the making
of contributions or payment of premiums in relation to each such Foreign

Parent will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 4.4_, " _Solvent_ "
means that, with respect to any Person and as of any date of determination,
(i) the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the assets of such
Person, will, as of such date, exceed the amount of the market value of all
"liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal Legal Requirements governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital with which to conduct its business and (iii) such
Person will be able to

 



47  pay its indebtedness as it becomes due. For purposes of the foregoing
definition only, "indebtedness" means a liability in connection with another
Persons (x) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (y) right to
any equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
right of payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured.

 

4.5 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
which has had or would have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4.6 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, investment bank or similar agent is entitled
to any investment banking, brokerage or finders fee in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon agreements or arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates.

 

4.7 _WTO Investor_. Parent is a "WTO Investor" for purposes of the Investment
Canada Act.

 

4.8 _Independent Investigation; No Reliance_. Parent acknowledges that none of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective partners, directors,
officers, employees, advisors, managers, agents, shareholders, members,
consultants, investment bankers, brokers, representatives, controlling persons
or Affiliates, agents or other representatives are making, have made,
and none of them shall be deemed to be making or have made, nor has Parent
relied on, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, whether
written or oral, express or implied, including any implied warranty of
merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses or the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than those explicitly set forth in _Article III_ of
this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedules), and the
Company expressly disclaims any other representations and warranties. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has made its own inquiry and investigation
into, and based thereon has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent has relied on such inquiry
and investigation and the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ of this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure
Schedules) and has not relied on any other representations or warranties of
any party (and all such other representations and warranties are specifically
disclaimed by the Company and the Subsidiaries), (b) has been furnished with
or given adequate access to such information about the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses as Parent has requested, (c) to
the extent it has deemed appropriate, has addressed in this Agreement any
matters arising out of its investigation and the information provided to it
and (d) will not assert any claim against the Company or any of its partners,
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, advisors, managers, agents,
shareholders, members, consultants, investment bankers, brokers,
representatives, controlling persons or Affiliates, or Affiliates of
Affiliates, that is based on, or hold any such Persons liable for, any
inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to information

 



48  furnished by the Company or any such Persons concerning the Company, its
Subsidiaries, their respective businesses, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (subject to the last sentence of this _Section 4.8_).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Company nor any
of its Affiliates or representatives are making any representation or warranty
with respect to (i) except as explicitly set forth in _Article III_ hereof
(as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedules), any information, documents
or materials made available to Parent in the "data room" created for purposes
of the sale of the Company, any management presentations, offering memoranda,
confidential information memoranda or in any other form in anticipation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any financial projections, estimates
or forecasts relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries. With respect to any
such projections, estimates or forecasts made available by or on behalf of the
Company, Parent acknowledges that (w) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make projections, estimates or forecasts, and such projections,
estimates or forecasts may not be accurate, (x) it is familiar with such
uncertainties, (y) it is taking full responsibility for making its evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections, estimates and forecasts
so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such projections, estimates or forecasts) and (z) it shall make no claim
against the Company (or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees,
advisors, managers, agents, shareholders, members, consultants, investment
bankers, brokers, representatives, controlling persons, Affiliates or
Affiliates of Affiliates) or any other Person with respect
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 4.8_ shall

hereunder in respect of any Fraud by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

4.9 _Knowledge_. Parent has no Knowledge of any breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any of the representations or warranties made by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in this Agreement, and Parent has no Knowledge that any of the
conditions to closing will not be satisfied on or prior to the End Date.

 

ARTICLE V

CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

5.1 _Access to Information Pending the Closing_. From the date hereof through
the earlier of the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article
VIII_ or the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice to the Company and subject
to any legal or contractual confidentiality restrictions to which the Company
or its Subsidiaries are subject (provided that the Company, to the extent
requested by Parent, will use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a waiver
of any such restriction or otherwise seek to provide reasonable access to such
information in a manner that does not violate such restriction), the Company
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent in
Parents reasonable investigation of the Business and properties and permit
Parent and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives and agents to have reasonable access during normal business
hours (and in a manner that is not disruptive to the ordinary course
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) to (i) the records and books
of account of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Records_ ") at the
Companys and its Subsidiaries principal place of business or at any location
where the Records are stored and (ii) the respective premises and properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than for purposes of environmental
testing without the Companys prior

 



49  written consent). In addition, the Company and the Members Representative
shall, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries, upon written request, to
make reasonably available to Parent during normal business hours (and in a
manner that is not disruptive to the ordinary course operations of the Company
and the Subsidiaries) members of the Companys senior management set forth on
_Schedule 5.1_ to discuss any of the affairs, finances and accounts of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall reimburse the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of
them in performing the covenants contained in this  _Section 5.1_. Parent
hereby acknowledges and agrees that all information and access provided
hereunder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing,
at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of Parent
under this _Section 5.1_ shall terminate (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any provisions that purport to survive termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that, from and after the
Closing, except as would have been permitted under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause its authorized
representatives and Affiliates to, treat and hold as confidential, and not
disclose to any Person, information related to the discussions and
negotiations between the parties regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and all confidential information relating to the Members.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect.

 

5.2 _Operation Pending the Closing_. From the date hereof through the earlier
of the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Article VIII_ or the
Closing Date, unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and as otherwise
required by this Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and substantially in the same manner as presently operated
(other than such modifications as may be necessary in preparation for the
consummation of the Closing), and use its commercially reasonable efforts to,
preserve its business organizations intact, maintain existing relations and
goodwill with Governmental Authorities, customers, suppliers, distributors,
creditors, lessors, employees and business relations, and keep available the
services of its present employees and agents. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the earlier of the date this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ or the Closing Date,
unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and except as otherwise
required by this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, take any of the actions referred to in _Sections
3.13(i)_  _3.13(xv)_ hereof.

5.3 _Preparation for Closing_.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to bring about the fulfillment of the
conditions precedent contained in this Agreement and to cause the Closing to
occur, including the execution and delivery of any documents, certificates,
instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not be deemed to require any party to waive any condition precedent to
its obligations hereunder or grant any accommodation or concession (financial
or otherwise) to any third party.

 



50 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all consents from third parties set
forth on _Schedule 5.3(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall
not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any
obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such consent may be required
or make any other accommodation or concession. Parent acknowledges that
certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby may be required from parties to the Company Contracts, the Company
Licenses and the Company Leases, or otherwise, and that such consents and
waivers have not been obtained as of the date hereof and may not be obtained
prior to the Closing and that no representation, warranty or covenant of the
Company contained herein shall be deemed breached, and no condition shall be
deemed to not have been satisfied, as a result of the failure to obtain any
such consent or waiver or the consequences thereof; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the foregoing shall
in no way limit or otherwise affect any provision of this Agreement requiring
the Company to disclose any such consents or waivers and shall not be deemed
to modify any of the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.3(b)_.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, (i) a fully executed
subordination, non-disturbance agreement from Canadian Imperial Bank of

property leased pursuant to the sublease at 599 Sprucewood Avenue, Windsor,
Ontario and (ii) an amendment to that certain Sublease, dated July 1, 2015,
between Buske, as sublandlord, and Cannon Automotive Solutions, as subtenant,
to correct the name of the subtenant entity to the legal name, which tenant
entity shall be agreed upon by the parties and (iii) a fully executed
subordination, non-disturbance agreement from the landlords mortgagee
relating to the lease at 162 Gene E. Stewart Blvd., Sylacauga, Alabama, USA.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any necessary consent required to assign to Parent as
"First Named Insured" all Scheduled Location Pollution Liability insurance
policies issued to Milestone Partners IV, L.P. or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Business by Allied
Worldwide Insurance Company or any of its Affiliates, including those
policies numbered 0310-3131 and 0310-3128, together with all right, title and
interest of any of the Milestone Funds under any such policies. If any such
consents are obtained prior to the Closing, or it is determined no such
consent is necessary, the Company will cause the applicable assignment
referred to in this _Section 5.3(d)_ to occur effective as of the Closing.

 

5.4 _Business Records_. For a period of five (5) years beginning on the
Closing Date, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, dispose of or destroy any of the Records relating to
periods prior to the Closing without first offering to turn over possession
thereof to the Members by written notice to the Members Representative at
least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or
destruction. During such five-year period and subject to any Legal
Requirements or binding confidentiality restrictions, Parent

 



51  shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, allow the
Members, Members Representative and their respective counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives and agents reasonable
access to all such Records during normal working hours (and in a manner that
is not disruptive to the ordinary course operations of Parent, its Affiliates,
the Company or its Subsidiaries) at the Companys and its Subsidiaries
principal place of business or at any location where the Records are stored,
and the Members and the Members Representative shall have the right, at their
own expense, to make copies of any Records in connection with (A) the
preparation of any Tax Return, accounting records or any audits or similar
proceedings, (B) any Action not involving the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including the presence of such Persons as witnesses in hearings or
trials for such purposes, or (C) any filings with any Governmental Authority.
In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
make available, on a mutually convenient basis, to the Members or the
Members Representative upon reasonable written request (i) Parents and the
Companys and its Subsidiaries personnel to assist the Members or the
Members Representative in locating and obtaining any Records and (ii) any
of Parents and the Companys and its Subsidiaries personnel whose
assistance or participation is reasonably required by any of the Members or
the Members Representative or any of their respective representatives or
agents, in each case to the extent necessary or useful in connection (A) the
preparation of any Tax Return, accounting records or any audits or similar
proceedings, (B) any Action not involving the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including the presence of such Persons as witnesses in hearings
or trials for such purposes, or (C) any filings with any Governmental
Authority. The Members or the Members Representative, as applicable, shall
reimburse Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by any of them in performing the covenants contained
in this _Section 5.4_.

 

5.5 _Members  Consent_. The Company shall (i) obtain and deliver, immediately
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Members Consent,
(ii) promptly following the execution of the Members Consent, deliver written
notice to those Members not executing the Members Consent of the action taken
thereby and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
irrevocable written consent of all Members not executing the Members Consent
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Promptly following
receipt of the Members Consent and any subsequently obtained written
consents, the Company shall deliver a copy of such Members Consent or other
written consent, as applicable, to Parent.

 

5.6 _Governmental Approvals and Consents_.

 

(a) Each party shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents and orders from all
Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement and any related agreements or documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall cooperate fully with
the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such
consents and orders. The parties shall not willfully take any action that will
have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
required appropriate consents and orders. Each party (i) agrees to submit a
complete notification under subsection 114(1) of the Competition Act to start
the waiting period prescribed under subsection 123(1) of the Competition Act
on July 4, 2017; (ii) agrees that Parent will make a request to the

 



52  Commissioner of Competition for an advance ruling certificate under section
102 of the Competition Act or in the alternative a no-action letter on July 4,
2017; (iii) agrees to make all filings required or considered appropriate
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement one (1) Business Day following the execution of this Agreement and
to request "early termination" of the waiting period thereunder, and (iv)

Authority any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and the Competition Act. Parent may make
any other filings to a Governmental Authority it considers appropriate in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Parents undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_, Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve objections, if any, that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
or any other party with respect to any antitrust, competition, investment or
trade regulation Legal Requirement so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible, provided
however, Parent shall not be required (x) to propose, negotiate, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or
of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this
Agreement, or (y) to otherwise take or commit to take actions that after
the Closing Date would limit Parents freedom of action, in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between the Company and any Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of
business, or any disclosure which is not permitted by Legal Requirement)
shall be disclosed to the other parties in advance of any filing, submission
or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another,
in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each
party shall give notice to the other parties with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the
staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being
sufficient to provide the other parties with the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact. To the extent
that any information to be supplied by a party to the other party under this
_Section 5.6_ contains competitively-sensitive or valuation information, the
supplying party shall provide to the receiving party a redacted version that
removes such competitively-sensitive or valuation information, and may provide
a complete, non-redacted version to the receiving partys external legal
counsel on an external legal counsel only basis.

 



53 5.7 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements and the Companys or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
respective Organizational Documents, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms for a period of not less than six years
after the Closing Date, and that Parent will honor and comply with, and cause
the Company to honor and comply with, all provisions granting such rights.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company to, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each Person that is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing, a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, against any and all losses,
damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments,
penalties, fees, Taxes, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in respect
of judgments, fines, penalties or settlement of Actions and legal fees and
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any pending or threatened
Action) arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual Action based in
whole or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the
fact that such Person is or was a member, director, officer, manager, employee
or other agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing
Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing
Date, in each case, to the full extent a corporation is permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements to indemnify such Persons, and Parent shall, and
shall cause the Company to, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any such Action to each such indemnified Person. Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, in the event any such Action is
brought against any such indemnified Person (whether arising before or after
the Closing Date), (i) each such indemnified Person may retain counsel
satisfactory to it and Parent shall, or shall cause the Company (after the
Closing Date) to, pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for such
indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefore are received, and (ii)
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter. The parties
hereto agree that all rights to indemnification hereunder, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any such
Action existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers,
employees or other agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters occurring through the Closing Date shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
hereunder asserted or made within such period will continue until the
disposition of such indemnified Actions. No amounts paid or advanced under
this _Section 5.7_ shall be included in the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, at its sole cost and expense
(all such costs and expenses to be paid prior to or at the Closing), purchase
or cause to be purchased a DandO runoff or tail policy or extension with respect
to each directors and officers liability policy listed on _Schedule 3.21_.

 

(d) This _Section 5.7_ shall be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and their respective heirs and estate, all of whom shall be
express third-party beneficiaries hereof.

 



54 5.8 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any disclosure contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedules, except to the extent taken into account as a liability
in calculation of Net Working Capital, the Members shall be severally, and
not jointly, liable for and pay, and indemnify and hold harmless the Parent
Indemnified Persons from and against, any and all Pre-Closing Taxes (it being
understood that the sole source of recovery from the Members by Parent
Indemnified Persons for Pre-Closing Taxes shall be the Escrow Amount held
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement). If any Pre-Closing Tax is indemnified under
an agreement or insurance policy described in the definition of Pre-Closing
Fleetwood Tax Amounts, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall first pursue that
remedy and shall be entitled to receive indemnification from the Escrow
Account to the extent that remedy proves insufficient, provided, however,
that in the event the Parent Indemnified Persons pursue such remedy but do not
recover such Pre-Closing Tax under such agreement or insurance policy by the
Escrow Release Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), a portion of the
Escrow Amount equal to such Pre-Closing Tax (to the extent available) shall
continue to be held in the Escrow Account to provide for indemnification in
the event such remedy ultimately proves insufficient.

 

(ii) In the case of any Tax period that begins on or before and ends after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), (i) the amount of any Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries based upon or measured by receipts, profits,
wages, capital, net worth, net income or gain for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (and, for greater certainty, determined on the
assumption that any partnership income for the Pre-Closing Tax Period is
allocated to, and included in the taxable income of, the members of
the partnership in the Pre-Closing Tax Period); _provided_ , _however_ , that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(such as the deductions for depreciation and real estate taxes) will be
apportioned between such two taxable periods on a daily basis and (ii) the
amount of other Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period will be determined by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, items
attributable to actions not in the ordinary course of business and not
contemplated by this Agreement taken by Parent, the Company or its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and after the Closing will not be
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

(i) The Members Representative shall timely prepare, or cause to be timely
prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, (x) all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date and (y) at the expense of the Members
Representative, all income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date required to be filed
after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Companys or such Subsidiarys past practice, except as
otherwise required by applicable law,

 



55  and shall be submitted by the Members Representative to Parent for review
(together with schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Parent,
supporting documentation) and approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) at least 20 Business Days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Tax Return or, in the case of any such Tax
Return that is required to be filed more frequently than annually (other than
income Tax Returns), at least 10 Business Days prior to the due date
(including extensions). The Members Representative shall (A) in the case of
Tax Returns described in clause (x) of this _Section 5.8(b)(i)_, cause the
Company to timely pay all amounts shown as due on such Tax Returns and (B) in
the case of Tax Returns described in clause (y) of this _Section 5.8(b)(i)_,
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay all amounts shown as due on such Tax Returns
to Parent three Business Days prior to the date that the Tax becomes due,
except to the extent that any such amounts were taken into account as
liabilities in Net Working Capital.

 

(ii) Parent shall timely prepare, or cause to be timely prepared, all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than Tax Returns described in _Section 5.8(b)(i)_)
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Companys or such Subsidiarys past practice,
except as otherwise required by applicable law, and shall be submitted by
Parent to the Members Representative for review (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent requested by the Members
Representative, supporting documentation) at least 20 Business Days prior to
the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Returns or, in the case of any
such Tax Return that is required to be filed more frequently than annually
(other than income Tax Returns), at least 10 Business Days prior to the due
date (including extensions). Parent shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments provided by the Members Representative. To the extent the
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for such an amount
of Tax reflected on such a Tax Return (determined in accordance with _Section
5.8(a)(ii)_ above), the Members Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay the amount due to Parent three Business Days prior to the date
that the Tax becomes due.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, in any Tax Return described in any of the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii), deduct any amount in the nature of a reserve or claim any
Tax credit that would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
include in a Post-Closing Tax Period any amount of income, unless the Tax
liability in respect of such income (determined as though such income were the
only income or loss of the entity for the tax period and without regard for
the availability of any loss carryforwards or carrybacks) is taken into
account as a liability in computing Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent may cause any of the Canadian Subsidiaries to make an election
pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the ITA in respect of the taxation year of
the Canadian Subsidiary ending as a result of the acquisition of control of it
by the Parent

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
Indemnified Persons shall not have any right to indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to, or based on, Taxes to the extent such Taxes result
from a transaction or action outside the ordinary course of business taken by
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing on the Closing Date that are
not contemplated by this Agreement.

 



56 (c) _Tax Refunds_. After the Closing Date, any refunds of Taxes (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto) of, or with respect to, the
Company or its Subsidiaries that are attributable or allocable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (whether received in cash or used as a credit against Taxes
otherwise due and payable) received (or reflected as a credit against Taxes
otherwise due and payable on a Tax Return filed) prior to the time when the
funds held in the Escrow Account are exhausted or otherwise released from
escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, will be for the account
of the Members, and Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Members
Representative (for distribution to the Members) an amount equal to such
refunds (net of any Taxes and expenses in connection with the payment
thereof) by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five Business
Days after (x) the later of the original due date or the filing date of the
Tax Return on which such credit is taken or (y) if received as a cash
refund, after such receipt, except, in each case, to the extent that such
refund (i) was taken into account in Net Working Capital or (ii) is
attributable to the carryback of Tax items from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. Each of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries
agrees to reasonably cooperate in filing such forms and taking such actions as
may be available to obtain a refund to which the Members are entitled under
this _Section 5.8(c)_ and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such refunds in a timely fashion.

(d) _No Amendments or Extensions_. Except as otherwise required by applicable
law, Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, without prior written consent of the
Members Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), refile, amend or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any applicable statute of limitations period with respect to) any
Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period filed by or with respect
to the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent such actions are taken prior
to the time when the funds held in the Escrow Account are exhausted or
otherwise released from escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement
or would have the effect of increasing the Members indemnification
obligation under _Section 5.8(a)(i)_.

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by
the Members Representative (on behalf of the Members) when due. The Members
Representative shall, at the Members Representatives expense, prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges (and Parent shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

 

(f) _Allocation of Purchase Price; Section 338(g) Election_. The parties
agree that, for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the Merger is
properly treated by the Members as a sale of their equity interests in the
Company and is properly treated by Parent as a purchase of all of the assets
of the Company for U.S. federal and state income Tax purposes. The purchase
price (for U.S. Tax purposes) shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company as set forth on _EXHIBIT E_ , which allocation shall be binding on the
parties (the " _Allocation_ "). Parent, the Company and the
Members Representative shall file all Tax Returns (including

 



57  amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports, filed for
U.S. federal or state income Tax purposes, in a manner consistent with such
allocation. Parent shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file and
deliver all such documents, forms and other information as Members
Representative may reasonably request to prepare such allocation. No party
shall take any position (whether in audits, tax returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation unless required to do so by Legal
Requirements. No election under Section 338(g) of the Code shall be made with
respect to the deemed purchase of the stock of PPHC North, Ltd.

 

(g) _Cooperation and Control of Tax Contests_. If Parent, the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates receives notice of any
audits, examinations, and administrative or judicial proceedings (including
Tax contests, assessments, notices of deficiency or other adjustments or
proposed adjustments) relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries conducted by
Tax authorities with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period prior to the time
when the funds held in the Escrow Account are exhausted or otherwise released
from the escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (" _Tax
Contests_ "), Parent shall promptly notify or cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to notify the Members Representative in writing of such Tax
Contest, provided, however, that failure to provide such notification shall
not obviate or limit the rights and remedies of the Parent Indemnified
Parties under _Section 5.8_, except to the extent the Members are materially
prejudiced by such failure. Parent shall have the right to conduct and control
the defense or settlement of such Tax Contests (other than any such Tax
Contest with respect to the partnership income Tax Returns of the Company),
provided that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
such Tax Contests in a timely fashion and shall keep the
Members Representative informed of the progress of such Tax Contests, shall
promptly provide the Members Representative with copies of all material
documents pertaining to such Tax Contests and shall not settle any Tax Contest
without the Members Representatives advanced written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the event that the
pending audit of The Electromac Group, Inc. by the Canada Revenue Agency that
is described in Schedule 3.14(k) has not been fully resolved by the Escrow
Release Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), a portion of the Escrow
Amount shall continue to be held in the Escrow Account to provide for
indemnification with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxes ultimately resulting
from such audit. Such amount shall equal the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes at
issue if such amount has been identified by the Canada Revenue Agency or if
the parties hereto are otherwise able to reasonably agree on an appropriate
estimate of the potential exposure; if no ceiling on the amount at issue has
been identified by the Canada Revenue Agency by such time and the parties are
unable to reasonably agree on an appropriate estimate of such amount,
the entire amount of the remaining Escrow Property (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) shall be retained in the Escrow until such time as such ceiling has
been determined, at which point any funds remaining in the Escrow Account in
excess of such ceiling shall be released to the Members Representative for
the benefit of the Members. The Members Representative shall have the right
to conduct and control the defense or settlement of Tax Contests with respect
to the partnership income Tax Returns of the Company, provided that the
Members Representative shall not settle any such Tax Contest if such
settlement would affect Parent or any of its Subsidiaries without Parents
advanced written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

 



58 (h) _Payments for Indemnified Taxes_. Where there has been an assessment or
reassessment of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 5.8(a)_, then the Escrow Agent shall be
required to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries from the Escrow Account
for the Taxes in question no later than the time that the relevant
Governmental Authority is permitted to take collection or enforcement action
in respect of such Taxes under applicable law (notwithstanding that the
obligation of the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, may not yet have
been finally determined at that time). Upon the final, non- appealable
determination (including by settlement) of any Taxes in respect of which an
indemnity payment was previously made under this _Section 5.8(h)_,
the necessary true-up payments shall be made from the Escrow Account to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or from the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Escrow Account or (after the distribution of the remaining balance in the
Escrow Account to the Members Representative on behalf of the Members in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) the Members (a " _Reduction True-Up_ "),
as applicable, to reflect the amount of such Taxes as finally determined.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Reduction True-Up is
payable to the Escrow Account or the Members as a result of the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.8(h)_, then, prior to the amount of such
Reduction True-Up being released to the Members, the amount of such Reduction
True-Up shall be applied first against any other claims which would otherwise
have been recoverable by any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement had sufficient funds remained in the Escrow Account.

(i) _Record Retention_. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Members
Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable period, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax
authority, and (ii) give the Members Representative reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records, and if the Members Representative so requests, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, allow the Members
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

(j) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no part of the Purchase
Price or any other amount paid or payable hereunder is paid or payable with
respect to the Non-Solicitation Agreements or the covenants contained therein.
The parties acknowledge that the Non-Solicitation Agreements and the covenants
contained therein are integral to this Agreement and are being provided
pursuant to this Agreement to maintain and preserve the fair market value of
the Units. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the covenants
contained in this _Section 5.8(l)_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

(k) If the Members Representative fails to pay any expense or other amount
for which it is responsible under this _Section 5.8_, Parent may, but shall
not be required to, recover such expense or amount from the Escrow Amount (it
being understood that the sole source of recovery from the Members by Parent
Indemnified Persons for Pre-Closing Taxes shall be shall be the Escrow Amount
held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement).

5.9 _[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]_.

 



59 5.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, and effective as of the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to continue to employ
each person who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at
Closing. Those persons who continue employment with the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries following the Closing are referred to herein as "
_Hired Employees_."

(b) Until January 1 in the calendar year following that in which the Closing
occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to provide to the Hired
Employees (i) base salary, wages, cash incentive or cash bonus opportunity
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary, wages, cash
incentive or cash bonus opportunity provided to the Hired Employees by the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
employee benefits that are no less favorable than employee benefits provided
to the Hired Employees by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Closing Date (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation).
Nothing in this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall prevent Parent from making any change
required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to not make any material changes
to the position, authority, duties or responsibilities, or other terms or
conditions of employment of any Hired Employee for at least 90 days following
the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a material
change to the terms and conditions of employment shall include a requirement
that employment be provided at a worksite that extends the Hired Employees
commuting distance, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, by
more than fifty (50) miles.

 

(d) With respect to each health or welfare plan, program, policy and
arrangement maintained by Parent in which the Hired Employees participate on
or after the Closing Date, Parent shall: use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) waive all active-at-work requirements, waiting periods, coverage
exclusions, pre-existing condition limitations on coverage, or similar
limitations with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each such Hired Employee during the plan year in which the
Closing Date falls, to the extent such limitations or requirements were waived
or satisfied under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (ii) to provide such Hired Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid (to the same extent such credit was given for
the year under a similar Company Plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements for the plan year in which the Closing Date falls. Parent shall
also recognize all service of such Hired Employee with the Company and its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date for eligibility, vesting and accrual
purposes under the Surviving Companys Employee Plans (but not for purposes of
defined benefit pension benefit accruals); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.10_ shall create any beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee or service provider (including any
spouse or dependent thereof) of the Company and its Affiliates or in any Hired
Employee in respect of continued employment for any specified period of
any nature or kind whatsoever. Notwithstanding

 



60  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement
is intended to, or does, constitute the establishment or modification of, or
an amendment to, any employee benefit plan or any Company Plan, or alter or
limit the ability of Parent or its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate
any of the Company Plans or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement on or after the Effective Time.

 

(f) Following the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, in
accordance with the terms of any applicable Transaction Bonus Agreements as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing, any payments that are due post-
Closing to employees of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries under the
terms of such Transaction Bonus Agreements as then in effect, which amounts
were included in the Company Transaction Expenses.

5.11 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date, upon the request
of either the Members Representative or Parent, each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, in the case of Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and
other instruments, documents and papers as either party may reasonably request
to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby, and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. To the extent the Members Representative, on the
one hand, or Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
discovers after the Closing that it, or its Affiliates, is the owner of,
receives or otherwise comes to possess any asset (including the receipt of
any payments) that, under the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, belongs to the other party, it shall promptly pay over such payment
at no cost, to the other party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no party shall be entitled to set off any such payments
received by it against claims for indemnification or other amounts due under
this Agreement.

 

5.12 _Related Party Contracts_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cause each Contract between any Related Party and the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, a true and complete list of which is listed on _Schedule
5.12_ , to be terminated without any continuing Liability following the
Closing on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or the Parent or
any of its Affiliates.

5.13 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Effective
Time, it may be necessary for the Parent or its Subsidiaries to enter into
debt or equity financing transactions (any such financing, a " _Pre-Merger
Financing Transaction_ "), including new financing in connection with the
Merger, or the refinancing of existing indebtedness or the
retirement, prepayment or redemption of existing indebtedness, whether or not
in connection with the Merger, and/or producing related amendments, amendment
and restatements, modifications, waivers or consents relating to any such Pre-
Merger Financing Transaction. In connection with any Pre-Merger Financing
Transaction, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information and documentation
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the structuring,
marketing and execution of any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, and shall,
and shall cause its officers, directors, employees and investment bankers to,
reasonably cooperate with Parent with 

 



61  respect to such financing, including: (i) participating in meetings, due
diligence sessions and rating agency presentations, at mutually agreeable
times, in connection with the Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, (ii)
assisting with the preparation of any portion of the disclosure in relation to
the Pre-Merger Financing Transaction that relates to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any historical financial
information and operational data and commercially reasonable efforts to
provide any information needed for the preparation of pro forma financial
statements by Parent), and (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and
security documents, guarantees, indentures, other definitive financing
documents and other certificates or documents, and legal opinions as may be
reasonably requested (in each case, subject to, and effective upon, the
occurrence of Closing).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.13_, (i)
nothing in this Agreement (including this  _Section 5.13_) shall (A) require
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Closing, or incur any liability or give any indemnities
or otherwise commit to take any action that is not contingent upon and
effective only following the Closing, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the
ordinary course of business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
(C) require any of the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any action that
would conflict with or violate such Persons organizational documents or
any applicable Legal Requirement or result in the contravention of, or that
would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any material Contract to which any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
is a party, or (D) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any
action that would result in any officer, director, employee or securityholder
of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability
with respect to any matters relating to any such Pre-Merger Financing
Transaction; (ii) no action, liability or obligation of any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
securityholders under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument relating to the Pre-Merger Financing Transaction shall be effective
until the Closing; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
parties hereto agree that any preparation of documents (including bank
information memoranda or other offer documents in connection with any Pre-
Merger Financing Transaction) and provision of information with respect to the
prospects and plans for any of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business
and operations in connection with any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction remains
the sole responsibility of Parent, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
their respective officers, directors, employees and securityholders, shall not
have any liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties with respect
thereto, and shall not be required to provide any information or make any
representations with respect to (A) capital structure, (B) the incurrence of
the Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, or (C) the manner in which Parent
intends to operate the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or cause
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be operated, after the
Closing.

 

(c) Parent shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing for any costs or expenses incurred in connection with
their compliance with this _Section 5.13_. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
expressly acknowledged and agreed that the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements is not conditioned upon the successful consummation of
any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction or any other "financing condition."

 



62 5.14 _Updated EDC Schedule_. On the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent an updated copy of _Schedule 3.26_
, dated as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, and shall not thereafter and prior to the time of Closing take
any action outside of the ordinary course of business to vary the amounts
drawn under such agreements.

5.15 _Certain Permit Matters_.

 

(a) Parent, in consultation with the Company, shall be entitled, on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, to take all steps deemed by the Parent to
be necessary to obtain all Environmental Activity Sector Registry (EASR)
registrations for prescribed activities in accordance with Section 20.21 of
the Ontario Environmental Protection Act and to obtain any and all
Environmental Compliance Approvals required by the Environmental Protection
Act or the Ontario Water Resources Act for any Real Property located in Canada
(the " _Canadian Environmental Approvals_ ").

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.15(a)_, the Company will cooperate with
Parent in connection with Parents preparation and submission, on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, of any required permit applications and the
taking of any other required steps to obtain the Canadian Environmental
Approvals, including obtaining any necessary studies and undertaking
those assessments and applying for those approvals set forth on _Schedule
5.15(b)_. In this regard, to the extent it is necessary or desirable to
utilize the services of an environmental consultant in obtaining the Canadian
Environmental Approvals, the parties agree to utilize the services of Trinity
Consultants as environmental consultant. In connection therewith, Parent shall
have the right to meet with the applicable Governmental Authority to discuss
the application process and the anticipated time and expense to obtain such
Canadian Environmental Approvals. The Company shall be entitled to review and
comment in advance upon all filings, applications and other submissions to the
applicable Governmental Authority prepared by Parent, none of which shall be
made without the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In this regard, the Company shall promptly
execute and deliver the agreed upon filings, applications, and submissions.

(c) The Members shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Parent Indemnified Persons from and against fifty percent (50%) of any
and all Liabilities incurred by the Parent Indemnified Persons in connection
with, arising out of or related to the Companys failure to have the Canadian
Environmental Approvals, including any and all Liabilities incurred by the
Parent Indemnified Persons in order to obtain the Canadian Environmental
Approvals and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with subclauses
(a) and (b) of this _Section 5.15_. Without limiting the foregoing and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the sole source of
recovery by the Parent Indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.15_ shall be
the Escrow Amount held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and no Parent
Indemnified Person shall have any recourse directly to any Member for any such
Liabilities.

 



63 5.16 _Section 280G Approval_. If required to avoid the imposition of excise
Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or the loss of deduction under Section
280G of the Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company will (a) no later
than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, solicit from each
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) who has
received or may reasonably be expected to receive any payment or benefits that
would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of such disqualified individuals rights
to some or all of such payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_
" and, each such waiver, a " _280G Waiver_ ") so that all remaining payments
and/or benefits, if any, shall not be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (b) no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date submit to a vote of the Members and/or such
other Persons entitled to vote (in a manner which satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such
Treasury Regulations) the rights of any such "disqualified individual" to
receive the Waived 280G Benefits. No later than three (3) Business Days prior
to soliciting 280G Waivers from the "disqualified individuals," the Company
shall provide drafts of such waivers and disclosure materials to Parent for
its review and approval. If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be
approved by the Members and/or such other Persons entitled to vote
contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that a vote of the Members and/or such
other Persons entitled to vote was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.16_ and that either (i) the requisite number of
votes of the Members and/or such other Persons entitled to vote was obtained
with respect to any Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (ii) the
280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, any Waived 280G
Benefits shall not be made or provided.

 

5.17 _Data Room_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Members
Representative shall deliver to Parent a compact disc or similar electronic
copy of the contents of the electronic "data room" entitled "Project Drive"
created for purposes of the sale of the Company as of the Closing Date.

66  has continued without cure until the earliest to occur of (i) the date that
is thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice of breach and (ii) the End
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1_ if it is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
hereunder.

 

(c) The Company may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to
Parent at any time prior to the Closing in the event Parent or Merger Sub is
in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement that would result in an inability of Parent and Merger Sub to
satisfy the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , the Company has
notified Parent of the breach in a written notice providing reasonable detail
of the facts giving rise to the breach, and such breach has continued without
cure until the earliest to occur of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days
after delivery of such notice of breach and (ii) the End Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1_ if it is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder.

(d) Parent or the Company may terminate this Agreement if a
Governmental Authority shall have issued a final and nonappealable
Governmental Order having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Parent or the Company may terminate this Agreement by providing written
notice to the other party at any time on or after August 30, 2017 (the " _End
Date_ "), if the Closing shall not have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall
not be available to any party if the failure of the Closing to have been
consummated on or before such date was primarily due to the failure of such
party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Any party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give prompt written
notice of such termination to the other parties.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement (other than the provisions of this
_Article VIII_ and _Article XI_ , which shall survive such termination
indefinitely) shall then be null and void and have no further force and
effect, and all other rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder will
terminate without any liability of any party to the other party, except for
liabilities arising in respect of any willful breach of this Agreement by
either party prior to such termination (which liability shall survive such
termination until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations).

ARTICLE IX

 

SURVIVAL

9.1  _Survival_. All representations and warranties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive the Closing for any purpose and
shall terminate as of the Closing, except in the case of Fraud. For the
avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, no claims with respect to the
representations and warranties under this Agreement shall be actionable
hereunder,

 



67  except in the case of Fraud. All covenants and agreements that contemplate
performance in full prior to the Closing shall not survive the Closing, and
all covenants contained in this Agreement which relate to performance of
obligations after the Closing shall survive the Closing for the periods
contemplated by their terms.

 

ARTICLE X

Members Representative pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to:

 

(a) give and receive notices and communications;

68 (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
the Members Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

10.2 _Resignation of Members  Representative_. The Members Representative
may resign at any time, and the Members Representative may be removed by

resigned or been removed, a new Members Representative shall be appointed by

written acceptance thereof by the new Members Representative.

 

10.3 _Limitations on Liability_. The Members Representative shall have no
liability to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Member with respect to
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Members
Representative. The Members Representative shall at all times be entitled to
rely on any directions provided by Members who, immediately prior to the
Closing, held greater than 50% of the voting interests of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Members Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as the Members Representative, unless the
Members Representative has been provided with other funds, security or
indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Members Representative,
are sufficient to protect the Members Representative against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Members Representative
in responding to such direction or taking such action. The Members
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary or advisable in connection
with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Members Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The
Members Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement for its costs and
expenses in performing its duties as Members Representative under this

such purpose, including for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants) incurred by the Members Representative in its
capacity as Members Representative. The Members Representative shall be
entitled to indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising
out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Members
Representative (except for those arising out of the Members Representatives
bad faith or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims.

ARTICLE XI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1  _Remedies Exclusive_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, except (a) as set forth in _Section 11.12_, (b) in the case
of Fraud and (c) for any recourse of the Parent Indemnified Persons to the
RandW Insurer, the recourse of Parent and Merger Sub to the Escrow Amount shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Parent Indemnified Person for
all claims, losses and damages of any kind, including any claims for breach
or indemnification, that

 



69  any Parent Indemnified Person may have arising from, or directly or
indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, it being understood and agreed
that when such escrowed funds are exhausted or otherwise released from escrow
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the right of any Parent
Indemnified Person to be indemnified or otherwise assert remedies pursuant
to this Agreement shall terminate absolutely (other than in the event of
Fraud). Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any and all other rights,
remedies, claims and causes of action (whether at law or in equity and
whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) that it or its Affiliates may
have otherwise had or that may arise under any applicable Contracts or Legal
Requirements or otherwise against the Members or any of their direct or
indirect Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
advisors, shareholders, members, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys,
brokers, controlling persons, partners, managers or other representatives
or agents thereof to the extent arising from, or directly or indirectly
relating to, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that, the foregoing shall in no way
limit the ability of Parent to bring any claim or cause of action for Fraud.
On the first anniversary of the Closing Date and at any time thereafter upon
request of Members Representative, Members Representative and Parent shall
sign and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent authorizing
the release of all of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account to the
Members Representative, except for the amount of any then Unresolved Claim
(as defined in the Escrow Agreement).

 

11.2 _Amendment or Waiver_. This Agreement can be amended or modified only by
a written instrument executed by Parent, the Company and the Members
Representative. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed
or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not
similar) or shall constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided or shall be effective unless in writing. Any waiver
hereunder shall be effective only if delivered to the other parties hereto in
writing by the party making such waiver.

 

11.3 _Severability_. In the event that any provision hereof would, under any
applicable Legal Requirement, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision shall (to the extent permitted under such applicable Legal
Requirement) be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, such
applicable Legal Requirement. The provisions hereof are severable, and in the
event any provision hereof should be held invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, it shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect any
other provision hereof.

 

11.4 _Successors and Assigns_. All of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted transferees and assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) no transfer or assignment by any party hereto shall be
permitted without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any such attempted transfer or assignment without consent shall be null and
void, and (b) no transfer or assignment by any party shall relieve such party
of any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, following the Closing, Parent may assign this Agreement and all of
its respective rights under this Agreement or any related documents, without
the prior written consent of any other party, to (i) following the Closing,
any successor or purchaser of any part of the business of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) the RandW Insurer; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
assignment pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall relieve Parent of any
of its respective obligations hereunder.

different address by delivering written notice as aforesaid to each of the
other parties hereto.

11.6  _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Action related to the subject
matter hereof (including the transactions contemplated hereby), or the
validity, interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement (whether at
law or in equity, and whether sounding in contract, tort or Legal
Requirement) shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements entered into and to be performed solely within such state, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would
cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

11.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement, by its execution
hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Delaware located in New Castle County, Delaware for the
purpose of any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or
otherwise), inquiry proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon
this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof, (b) hereby waives to
the extent not prohibited by applicable laws, and agrees not to assert by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it
is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that
its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such
proceeding brought in one of the above-named courts is improper, or that this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court and (c) hereby agrees not to commence any action, claim, cause of action
or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation
arising out of or based upon this Agreement or relating to

 



72  the subject matter hereof other than before one of the above-named courts
nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause

(in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation to any

inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party hereby consents to service of
process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by the laws of the
State of Delaware, and agrees that service of process by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant
to  _Section 11.5_ is reasonably calculated to give actual notice.

11.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED
UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY: (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.8_. ANY
PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 11.8_
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE
WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

11.9 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto will issue or make any
report, statement or release to the public (including employees, customers
and suppliers of the parties) with respect to the execution of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except for any such disclosure that is, in the opinion
of the disclosing partys counsel, required by any Legal Requirement or any
Governmental Authority (including in the case of Parent, pursuant to its
reporting obligations under the federal securities laws or by its listing
agreement with any securities exchange as determined in its good faith
judgment). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any public
report, statement or release is permitted under this _Section 11.9_, the
disclosing party shall provide the other parties with a draft of any such
public announcement in advance of such public announcement and the other
parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

11.10 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise contemplated by 
_Section 5.7(d)_ and _Section 5.8_, nothing in this Agreement is intended or
shall be construed to entitle any Person, other than the parties hereto, their
respective transferees and assigns permitted hereby, to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind.

 



73 11.11 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, (a) all Company Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the
Members (or by the Company if the Closing occurs) and (b) all costs, fees and
expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the negotiation
and preparation of this Agreement and any related agreements or documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be responsible for all
filing and other similar fees payable in connection with any filings or
submissions under the HSR Act and the Competition Act. In the event that
Parent or Merger Sub (or any Affiliate thereof) institutes any Action for
Fraud against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Members
Representative, any of the Members, or any of their respective Affiliates, and
does not prevail in that Action, upon the receipt of a final and non-
appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction in such Fraud Action,
the prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to
all other damages to which they may be entitled, the reasonable and documented
costs incurred by such party or parties in defending the Fraud Action,
including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs.

11.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
parties agrees that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the other
parties will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action
instituted in the state courts of Delaware in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that,
in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach
or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would
be adequate.

11.13 _Company Disclosure Schedules_. Certain information included in the
Company Disclosure Schedules has been included solely for informational
purposes. The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Schedules
shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment that such information is
required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedules, that such items are
material to the Company, that such items are expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or that such items are within or outside of the ordinary
course of business. Furthermore, the inclusion in the Company Disclosure
Schedules of information or the exclusion of information from the Company
Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed an admission regarding any level
of materiality for purposes of this Agreement. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections and subsections of the Company Disclosure Schedules are
inserted for convenience only and will not be deemed to constitute a part
thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedules are
arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedules as an exception to any particular covenant,
representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception
with respect to all other covenants, representations or warranties to the
extent that such item is cross referenced therein or to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face to

 



74  such other covenants, representations or warranties. The information and
statements contained in the Company Disclosure Schedules are not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Members except as and to the extent
provided in the text of this Agreement. Any summary or description of any
Legal Requirement, Contract or other document contained in the Company
Disclosure Schedules is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such
Legal Requirement, Contract or other document.

11.14  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in portable document format or other electronic format
will be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

 

11.15 _Conflict Waiver_ ; Attorney Client Privilege. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, shareholders, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that:

(a) Each of Drinker Biddle and Reath LLP (" _DBR_ ") and Goodmans LLP ("
_Goodmans_ ") has acted as counsel to the Company, the Members Representative
and their respective Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Group_ ") in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
agrees that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
such representation and any prior representation of the Company Group by DBR
or Goodmans shall not preclude DBR or Goodmans from serving as counsel to the
Members Representative, any Member or any director, member, stockholder,
partner, officer or employee of any Member, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Parent shall not seek or have DBR or Goodmans disqualified from any such
representation based upon the prior representation of the Company Group by
DBR or Goodmans. Each of the parties hereby consents thereto and waives any
conflict of interest arising from such prior representation, and each of such
parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. Each of the parties acknowledges
that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully
considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or have been
advised they should do so in connection herewith. The covenants, consent and
waiver contained in this _Section 11.15_ shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which DBR or Goodmans is entitled whether pursuant to Legal
Requirement, Contract or otherwise. 

(c) All communications among the Members Representative, any Member, the
Company and any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and DBR
and/or Goodmans, on the other hand, relating to the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and any agreements or documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Privileged
Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney client privileged and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
Members Representative, may be controlled only by the Members
Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent.

 



75  Accordingly, Parent shall not have access to any Privileged Communications
or to the files of DBR or Goodmans relating to such engagement from and after
the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after
the Closing, (i) the Members Representative (and not Parent) shall be the
sole holder of the attorney client privilege with respect to such engagement,
and Parent shall not be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
DBR or Goodmans in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the Members Representative (and not Parent) shall hold such
property rights and (iii) neither DBR nor Goodmans shall have any duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney client communications or
files to Parent by reason of any attorney client relationship between DBR
and/or Goodmans, on the one hand, and the Members Representative,
any Member, the Company and/or Affiliate of such Person or otherwise, on the
other hand. This right to attorney client privilege shall exist even if such
communications may exist on any computer system or in documents comprising
part of the assets owned by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between Parent or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and a third party other than the Members Representative, any Member,
the Company and/or Affiliate of such Person, on the other hand, Parent and
its Affiliates may assert the attorney client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Members Representative. In the event
that Parent or any of its Affiliates is legally required by Governmental Order
or otherwise legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion
of the Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, and (y) advisable in the opinion of Parents counsel, then
Parent shall as promptly as practicable notify Members Representative in
writing so that Members Representative can seek a protective order.

(d) This _Section 11.15_ is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, DBR and Goodmans. This _Section 11.15_ shall be irrevocable,
and no term of this _Section 11.15_ may be amended, waived or modified,
without the prior written consent of DBR and Goodmans.

11.16 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement
among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the parties with respect to such subject matter,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 20, 2017, by and
between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the
Closing Date, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations
of the parties thereunder shall terminate.

A. Parent, Members Representative, PPHC Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Company_ "), and Drive Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "), have entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of June 30, 2017 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the parties
have agreed, among other things, that Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger and
continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. All capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in
the Merger Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the Escrow Agent will not be
responsible to determine or to make inquiry into any term, capitalized, or
otherwise, not defined herein.

B. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms thereof, (i)
Parent and Members Representative shall enter into this Escrow Agreement and
(ii) a portion of the Purchase Price shall be deposited by Parent into escrow,
and the Escrow Agent agrees to hold such funds in escrow in a separate and
distinct account designated by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ ")
and to distribute such funds, in each case, in accordance with the terms of
this Escrow Agreement.

 

C. The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not a party to, is not
bound by, and has no duties or obligations under, the Merger Agreement, that
all references in this Escrow Agreement to the Merger Agreement are for
convenience, and that the Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties beyond the
express duties set forth in this Escrow Agreement.

 

In consideration of the mutual promises and agreements of the Parties set
forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow
Agent agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

ESCROW DEPOSIT

Section 1.1. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. The Parties hereby appoint Escrow
Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and Escrow
Agent hereby accepts such appointment for the purpose of receiving and
disbursing funds from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth herein. Section 1.2. _Deposit of Escrow Property_. Upon the execution hereof by the
Parties and Escrow Agent, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Escrow Account the amount of $10,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

The Escrow Agent hereby accepts and agrees to hold the Escrow Property (as
defined below) in the Escrow Account and to not distribute or release any
portion thereof except in accordance with the provisions of this Escrow
Agreement.

Section 1.3. _Investments_.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deposit, transfer, hold and
invest the Escrow Amount and any investment income and earnings accrued
thereon (collectively, the " _Escrow Property_ ") as set forth in _Exhibit A_
hereto, or as set forth in any subsequent written instruction signed by each
of the Parties. Any investment earnings and income on the Escrow Property
shall become part of the Escrow Property, and shall be disbursed in accordance
with _Section 1.4_ of this Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any investment
or sale of investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent
is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by
this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or
with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such affiliate is
acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as
principal for its own account. The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent
is not providing investment supervision, recommendations, or advice.

 

(c) The Parties agree that confirmations of permitted investments are not
required to be issue by the Escrow Agent for each month in which a monthly
statement is rendered. No statement need be rendered for any fund or account
if no activity occurred in such fund or account during such month.

 

Section 1.4. _Disbursements_. The Escrow Property held pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement is intended to provide an exclusive source of funds for the payment
of any amounts which may become payable to Parent under Section 2.13, Section
5.8(a)(i) or Section 5.15(c) of the Merger Agreement or otherwise. The Escrow
Property shall only be distributed and released as follows:

 

(a) _Joint Written Instructions_. At any time and from time to time on or
prior to [●], 20181 (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "), upon its receipt of joint
written instructions signed by Members Representative and Parent authorizing
the release of all or any portion of the Escrow Property in the Escrow
Account, the Escrow Agent shall, within three (3) Business Days of receiving
such instruction, release, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated in writing in such joint written instruction, the
amount of Escrow Property from the Escrow Account specified in such joint
written instructions.



   1  | Note to Draft: To be 1 year following Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



2 (b) _Adjustment-Related Disbursements_. Parent and Members Representative
shall, promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the
final determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.13 of the
Merger Agreement, deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction (i)
authorizing and directing to be released to Parent the amount (if any) of the
Escrow Property to be released to Parent from the Escrow Account pursuant to
Section 2.13(e) of the Merger Agreement and (ii) authorizing and directing to
be released to Members Representative any Escrow Property that remains in
the Escrow Account on such date (following any release to Parent pursuant to
clause (i) above) in excess of $4,000,000 (if any).

 

(c) _Indemnification Related Claims_.

 

(i) At any time and from time to time on or prior to the Escrow Release Date,
if any Parent Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnity pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 5.8(a)(i) or Section 5.15(c) of the Merger
Agreement (a " _Claim_ "), Parent, on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party,
may deliver to the Escrow Agent and Members Representative a written notice
(an " _Escrow Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and
basis of the Claim by the Parent Indemnified Party as well as the amount of
the Claim (or a good faith estimate of the amount of the Claim if the Claim
is not yet reasonably ascertainable) (the " _Claim Amount_ "). Promptly upon
receipt of an Escrow Notice (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days
of such receipt), the Escrow Agent shall provide a copy of such Escrow
Notice, and the date on which it received such Escrow Notice, to Members
Representative. Members Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days
following receipt of an Escrow Notice to deliver to Escrow Agent and Parent
an objection in writing to the Claim (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), which notice
shall state whether Members Representative disputes the validity of the
Claim, the Claim Amount or any portion thereof. At least two (2) Business
Days prior to the expiration of the 30-day objection period, if no Dispute
Notice has been received, the Escrow Agent shall provide notice to Parent and
Members Representative of the expiration of such objection period; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall be solely responsible for the
accurate determination of the beginning date and the last day of the objection
period, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any omission to provide
such notice as is set forth in this provision. If the Escrow Agent has not
received a Dispute Notice with respect to an Escrow Notice (whether as to the
validity of the Claim or the Claim Amount) by 11:59 pm (Eastern Daylight Time
or Eastern Standard Time, as applicable) on the 30th calendar day following
the Escrow Agents receipt of such Escrow Notice, then promptly, but in any
event within two (2) Business Days thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall release,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing to the Escrow Agent by Parent, an amount of Escrow Property from the
Escrow Account equal to the amount of such Claim. The Escrow Agent shall not
inquire into whether any person constitutes a Purchaser Indemnified Party
under the Merger Agreement or whether any Claim complies with the requirements
of the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be permitted to treat (A) any
notice claiming to constitute an Escrow Notice as an Escrow Notice within the
meaning of this Agreement and (B) any notice claiming to constitute a Dispute
Notice as a Dispute Notice within the meaning of this Agreement.

 



3 (ii) If Members Representative in good faith delivers to the Escrow Agent and
Parent a Dispute Notice within the 30 calendar day period following the
Escrow Agents receipt of an Escrow Notice, then, the Escrow Agent shall not
distribute to Parent any portion of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account
on account of the Claim that is the subject of the Dispute Notice until the
Escrow Agent receives either (A) joint written instructions signed by Members
Representative and Parent authorizing the release to Parent of the portion of
the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account that is agreed upon as the amount
recoverable in respect of the Dispute Notice or (B) a final and non-appealable
judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction or other
judicial body having proper authority over the Parties directing the release
to Parent of the portion of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account that
such body determined to be recoverable in respect of the Dispute Notice;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if Members Representative
objects to the Claim Amount only in part, the Escrow Agent shall, after the
lapse of the 30-calendar day period set forth in _Section 1.4(c)(i)_,
promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter, deliver
to Parent an amount from the Escrow Property equal to the portion of the Claim
Amount not objected to by Members Representative. Upon receipt of any such
joint written instructions or such final and non-appealable order, as the
case may be, the Escrow Agent shall release to Parent such amount of the
Escrow Property in the Escrow Account in accordance with such written
instructions or final and non-appealable order.

 

(d) _Release of Remaining Escrow Property_.

 

(i) Within two (2) Business Days after the Escrow Release Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release to Members Representative, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Members
Representative in writing, the remaining balance (if any) of the Escrow
Property in the Escrow Account, less the amount of all Unresolved Claims.

 

(ii) For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, the term " _Unresolved Claims_ "
shall mean, as of 11:59 p.m. on the Escrow Release Date, the aggregate amount
of all Claims that are the subject of a Dispute Notice that have not
previously been resolved or satisfied in accordance with _Section 1.4(c)(ii)_
or that were properly and timely asserted under this Escrow Agreement and are
unresolved or unsatisfied as of the Escrow Release Date, including any Claims
for which an Escrow Notice has been delivered but for which the 30-day
objection period has not expired as of the Escrow Release Date.

 

(iii) Unresolved Claims for which Members Representative has delivered (or
timely delivers during an unexpired 30-day objection period) a Dispute Notice
in accordance with subclauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 1.4(c)_ shall be
administered in accordance with subclause (ii) of _Section 1.4(c)_, as well
as this _Section 1.4(d)(iii)_. With respect to any Unresolved Claims for
which the thirty (30) day objection period has not expired as of the Escrow
Release Date, (A) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration of
the thirty (30) day objection period, if no Dispute Notice has been received,
the Escrow Agent shall provide notice to Parent and Members Representative of
the expiration of such objection period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parties shall be solely responsible for the accurate determination of the
beginning date and the last day of the objection period, and the Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for any omission to provide such notice as is set forth in
this provision, and (B) upon the expiration of the 30-day objection period
for any Unresolved Claim, if no Dispute Notice has been delivered in
accordance with subclauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 1.4(c)_, the Escrow Agent
shall, within two (2)

 



4  Business Days following the expiration thereof, release by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Parent an
amount of Escrow Property from the Escrow Account equal to the amount of such
Unresolved Claim for which no Dispute Notice has been delivered. After the
final resolution of each Unresolved Claim in accordance with this _Section
1.4_, any remaining portion of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account not
distributed to Parent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentences and not
subject to other Unresolved Claims shall be released by wire transfer promptly
thereafter by the Escrow Agent to an account designated in writing
by Members Representative.

(e) _Distributions Deemed Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All distributions of
the Escrow Property to Parent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement shall be
deemed to be adjustments to the purchase price paid or received pursuant to
the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(f) _Court Order_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Escrow
Agreement to the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow
Property (or any portion thereof) in accordance with a notice delivered by a
Party to the Escrow Agent and the other Party of a final and non-appealable
judgment, order or decree from a court of competent jurisdiction having proper
authority over the Parties, _provided_ such notice is accompanied by (i) a
copy of the order pursuant to which such court has determined whether and to
what extent the applicable Party is entitled to receive the Escrow Property
(or any portion thereof) and (ii) a certificate of the presenting Party to
the effect that such judgement or order is final, non-appealable and from a
court of competent jurisdiction having proper authority of the Parties. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such final and non-appealable
judgement, order or decree without further question, inquiry, or consent.

(g) _No Duty to Calculate or Confirm_. In any case hereunder in which the
Escrow Agent is to receive instructions to disburse Escrow Property, the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to entirely rely on such instructions with no
responsibility to calculate or confirm amounts or percentages to release.

Section 1.5. _Security Procedure For Funds Transfers_. The Escrow Agent shall
confirm each funds transfer instruction received in the name of a Party by
means of the security procedure selected by such Party and communicated to the
Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ (with
respect to Parent) or  _Exhibit B-2_ (with respect to Members
Representative) attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow Agent shall
become a part of this Escrow Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent,
_Exhibit B-1_ or  _Exhibit B-2_ may be revised or rescinded only by a writing
signed by an authorized representative of the applicable Party, as set forth
in such Exhibit. Such revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after
actual receipt and following such period of time as may be necessary to
afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised
_Exhibit B-1_ or _B-2_ or a rescission of an existing _Exhibit B-1_ or  _B-2_
is delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest
to such Party, Escrow Agent may require that such document be accompanied by
additional documentation satisfactory to the Escrow Agent showing that
such entity has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the Party
under this Escrow Agreement.

 



5 The Parties understand that the Escrow Agents inability to receive or confirm
funds transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure selected by
such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and
agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any
such delay.

 

Section 1.6. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest and other
income from investment of the Escrow Property shall, as of the end of each
calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Service, be
reported as having been earned by Parent, whether or not such income was
disbursed during such calendar year. If any interest or other income is earned
on any investment of any portion of the Escrow Property, then within five (5)
Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter in which such interest or
other income is earned, and in addition, on a day that is at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the final disbursement of the balance of the Escrow
Property, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Parent, in accordance with the
payment instructions attached as Exhibit D hereto which may be amended and
supplemented from time to time by Parent (without any requirement of the
consent of any other Party), an amount equal to 40% of the amount of such
interest or other income earned thereon, in each case, since the end of the
prior calendar quarter.

 

(b) For certain payments made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent may be required to make a "reportable payment" or "withholdable
payment" and in such cases the Escrow Agent shall have the duty to act as a
payor or withholding agent, respectively, that is responsible for any tax
withholding and reporting required under Chapters 3, 4, and 61 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). The Escrow
Agent shall have the sole right to make the determination as to which payments
are "reportable payments" or "withholdable payments." All parties to this
Escrow Agreement shall provide an executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS
Form W-8 (or, in each case, any successor form) to the Escrow Agent prior to
the date hereof, and shall promptly update any such form to the extent such
form becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect. The Escrow Agent shall
have the right to request from any party to this Escrow Agreement, or any
other person or entity entitled to payment hereunder, any additional
forms, documentation or other information as may be reasonably necessary for
the Escrow Agent to satisfy its reporting and withholding obligations under
the Code. To the extent any such forms to be delivered under this _Section
1.6(b)_ are not provided prior to the date hereof or by the time the related
payment is required to be made or are determined by the Escrow Agent to be
incomplete and/or inaccurate in any respect, the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to withhold (without liability) a portion of any interest or other
income earned on the investment of the Escrow Property or on any such payments
hereunder to the extent withholding is required under Chapters 3, 4, or 61 of
the Code, and shall have no obligation to gross up any such payment.

(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow
Property, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible
from the Escrow Property. The Parties, jointly and severally, shall indemnify,
defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late
payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed
against the Escrow

 



6  Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Property and the investment thereof
unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other expense was directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The
indemnification provided by this _Section 1.6(c)_ is in addition to the
indemnification provided in _Section 3.1_ and shall survive the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.7. _Termination_. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the
disbursement of all of the Escrow Property, including any interest and
investment earnings thereon, in accordance with _Section 1.4_ of this Escrow
Agreement, except that the provisions of _Sections 1.6(c)_ , _3.1_ and _3.2_
hereof shall survive termination and the Escrow Agent is authorized and
directed to disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with _Section 1.4_ of
this Escrow Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 2

DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT

Section 2.1. _Scope of Responsibility_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, the Escrow Agent is obligated only to perform the duties
specifically set forth in this Escrow Agreement, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature. Under no circumstance will the Escrow Agent be deemed
to be a fiduciary to any Party or any other person under this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible or liable for the failure
of any Party to perform in accordance with this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the
terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document other
than this Escrow Agreement (including the exhibits attached hereto and any
agreements, instruments or documents delivered hereunder), whether or not an
original or a copy of such agreement has been provided to the Escrow Agent;
and the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to know or inquire as to the
performance or nonperformance of any provision of any such agreement,
instrument, or document. References in this Escrow Agreement to any
other agreement, instrument, or document are for the convenience of the
Parties, and the Escrow Agent has no duties or obligations with respect
thereto. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible to determine or to make
inquiry into the definition of any defined term, capitalized or otherwise,
not defined herein. This Escrow Agreement sets forth all matters pertinent to
the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no additional obligations of the Escrow
Agent shall be inferred or implied from the terms of this Escrow Agreement or
any other agreement.

Section 2.2. _Attorneys and Agents_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Escrow Agent in good faith and in accordance with the advice of counsel
or other professionals retained or consulted by the Escrow Agent, unless
directly caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as set
forth in _Section 3.2_. The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed as set forth in
_Section 3.1_ for any and all reasonable and documented (fees, expenses and
other costs) paid and/or reimbursed to such counsel and/or professionals by
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties
through its agents, representatives, attorneys, custodians, and/or nominees;
_provided_ that the Escrow Agent shall remain liable for the performance of
its duties and obligations hereunder, regardless of employment or retention of
any such affiliates or agents.

 



7 Section 2.3. _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the
Parties or their respective agents, representatives, successors, or assigns,
except to the extent that its following or acting upon any such direction or
consent is not permitted by the terms hereof. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any notice,
request, consent, direction, requisition, certificate, order, affidavit,
letter, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, without
further inquiry into the persons or persons authority. Concurrent with the
execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_ , which contain authorized
signer designations in Part I thereof. Each Party represents and warrants for
itself that each person signing this Escrow Agreement on behalf of such Party
is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Escrow Agreement, and each
person that may execute and deliver any exhibit, agreement, document, or
instrument on behalf to be executed and delivered by such Party pursuant to
this Escrow Agreement shall be so duly authorized upon the execution and
delivery thereof.

Section 2.4. _Right Not Duty Undertaken_. The permissive rights of the
Escrow Agent to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be
construed as duties.

Section 2.5. _No Financial Obligation_. No provision of this Escrow Agreement
shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability or potential financial liability in the
performance of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this
Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE 3

 

PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT

 

Section 3.1. _Indemnification_. The Parties, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify the Escrow Agent from and against any and all loss,
liability, cost, damage and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable outside attorneys fees of any
litigation), which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by reason of any
action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent arising out of
or relating in any way to this Escrow Agreement or any transaction to which
this Escrow Agreement relates, unless such loss, liability, cost, damage or
expense shall have been finally adjudicated to have been caused by the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Escrow Agent. The provisions of
this _Section 3.1_ shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement. Solely as between Parent
and Members Representative, and without limitation of the Escrow Agents
rights under this _Section 3.1_, each of Parent and Members Representative
hereby agree between themselves to each pay fifty percent (50%) of any such
indemnification obligations.

Section 3.2. _Limitation of Liability_. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT
OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW AGENTS
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL

 



8  MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS),
EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES
OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

Section 3.3. _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign by
providing thirty (30) calendar days written notice of its resignation to the
Parties, and the Parties may remove the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the
Escrow Agent a joint written notice of its removal along with payment of all
fees and expenses to which the Escrow Agent is entitled through the date of
removal. Such resignation or removal, as the case may be, shall be effective
thirty (30) calendar days after the delivery of such notice or upon
the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agents sole
responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Property and to
deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as shall be appointed by the
Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice filed with the Escrow Agent
or in accordance with a court order. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period
following the delivery of such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow
Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon the Parties.

 

Section 3.4. _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto
as  _Exhibit C_ , which compensation (together with any other fees or
expenses and related disbursements incurred by the Escrow Agent in carrying
out its obligations hereunder that are required to be paid by the Parties
pursuant to the terms hereof) shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by each of
Parent and Members Representative promptly as such amounts become due. The
fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full
compensation for the Escrow Agents services as contemplated by this Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the conditions for
the disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or
the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow
Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of
this Escrow Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material
controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any
litigation pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof,
then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation or event.
The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the
Escrow Property with respect to its unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses
and unsatisfied indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any
other persons or entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and
deduct any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied
indemnification rights from the Escrow Property. For the avoidance of doubt,
the fees payable pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be the sole
compensation payable to Escrow Agent for performing the duties and obligations
imposed under this Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 3.5. _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning
or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow

 



9  Agent is in doubt as to the action to be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent
may, at its option, retain the Escrow Property until the Escrow Agent (i)
receives a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or
a final non-appealable arbitration decision directing delivery of the Escrow
Property, (ii) receives a written agreement executed by each of the parties
involved in such disagreement or dispute directing delivery of the Escrow
Property, in which event the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to disburse the
Escrow Property in accordance with such final court order, arbitration
decision, or agreement, or (iii) files an interpleader action in any court of
competent jurisdiction, and upon the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be
relieved of all liability as to the Escrow Property and shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and other costs incurred
in commencing and maintaining any such interpleader action. Any such court
order, judgment or award or arbitration decision shall be accompanied by a
written instrument of the presenting Party certifying that such court order,
judgment or award or arbitration decision is final, non-appealable and from a
court of competent jurisdiction or from a competent arbitration panel, upon
which instrument the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely
without further investigation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on
any such agreement, court order, judgment or award or arbitration decision
without further question, inquiry, or consent.

10  failure or delay in the Escrow Agents performance of its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 3.8_, the Escrow Agent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the
banking industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under
the circumstances.

suits, actions, claims or proceedings (whether based on contract, tort, equity

Agency and Custody Account Direction

 

For Cash Balances

Wells Fargo Money Market Deposit Accounts

You are hereby directed to deposit all Escrow Property received pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached in the money market
deposit account of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as indicated below,
or as the Parties shall otherwise direct further in writing from time to time:

 

Wells Fargo Money Market Deposit Account (the "MMDA")

 

We understand that amounts on deposit in the MMDA are insured, subject to the
applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), in the basic FDIC insurance amount of $250,000 per
depositor, per insured bank. This includes principal and accrued interest up
to a total of $250,000.

 

We acknowledge that we have full power to direct investments of the Escrow
Property.

 

We understand that we may change this direction at any time and that it shall
continue in effect until revoked or modified by us by written notice to
you. Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A and not defined herein shall
have the meaning given to such terms in the Escrow Agreement to which this
Exhibit A is attached. _EXHIBIT B-1_

 

The undersigned, in his capacity as an officer of AK Steel Corporation ("
_Parent_ "), certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers, e-mail
addresses and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit
B-1 identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or
confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of
Parent, and that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 is the
security procedure selected by Parent for use in verifying that a funds
transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of Parent.

 

Parent has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that
the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 best meets its
requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will
issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in
Part III of this Exhibit B-1, Parent acknowledges that it has elected to not
use the other security procedures described and agrees to be bound by any
funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
accepted by the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular security
procedure chosen by Parent.

 

 _NOTICE_ : The security procedure selected by Parent will not be used to
detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Parent. If a
funds transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment
inconsistently by name and account number, payment may be made on the basis of
the account number even if it identifies a person different from the named
beneficiary. If a funds transfer instruction describes a participating
financial institution inconsistently by name and identification number, the
identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the
financial institution. Therefore, it is important that Parent take such steps
as it deems prudent to ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the
funds transfer instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent.

one person is designated in both Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1. Parent
understands the risks associated with communicating sensitive matters,

be liable for any loss of the confidentiality of instructions and data prior

MEMBER LETTER

Dear Unitholder:

 

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 30, 2017 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), among PPHC Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "), AK Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Drive Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and PPHC Members
Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Members 
Representative_"), in its capacity as the Members Representative appointed
pursuant to Article X of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and the Company will be the Surviving
Company and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. The Merger has been approved by
the requisite number of holders of Company Units (as defined below) and it is
anticipated that the Merger will occur on or about [ _ _], 2017
(the date and time at which the Merger is completed is referred to in this
Member Letter as the " _Effective Time_ "). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement.

 

You are receiving this Member Letter because you are a holder of units of the
Companys Preferred Membership Interests (" _Preferred Units_ "), Common
Membership Interests (" _Common Units_ ") and/or Junior Membership Interests
(" _Junior Units_ " and together with the Preferred Units and Common Units,
the " _Company Units_ "). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at
the Effective Time, all Company Units issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger (other than those Company Units owned by the Company and held in
treasury or otherwise), whether vested or unvested, will be automatically
cancelled and converted solely into the right for the former holders of such
Company Units to receive such amounts in cash as described in the Merger
Agreement. As provided in the Merger Agreement, subject to the order and
manner of distributions to the Companys members set forth in Section 4.2(b)
of the Companys Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating
Agreement, dated August 30, 2016 (the " _LLC Agreement_ ") you will have the
right to receive for each Company Unit (i) a portion of the Closing
Consideration, (ii) a portion of any post-closing adjustment that results in
an increase to the Estimated Purchase Price, (iii) a portion of any funds
that may be released from the Escrow Account to the Members Representative
and (iv) a portion of any funds that may be released by the Members
Representative from the Holdback Amount (we refer to such amounts herein,
collectively, as your "portion of the Purchase Price"). All consideration
payable to you under the Merger Agreement will be paid without interest and
subject to applicable withholding.

 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, in order to receive the consideration
to which you may be entitled in respect of your Company Units, you are
required to complete this Member Letter. To facilitate the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the exchange of your
Company Units for your portion of the Purchase Price, we request that you

"AGREEMENT"

 

In compliance with the accompanying instructions, the undersigned on its own
behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns and, if applicable, its
heirs, executors and administrators, hereby delivers this executed and
completed Member Letter to the Members Representative in exchange for the
right to receive, subject to the Closing having occurred, for each Company
Unit owned by the undersigned and issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time which is transferred and surrendered hereunder, in cash,
the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to such Company Units.

 

In order to induce Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the payment of the Purchase Price as called for
by the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned,
intending to be legally bound, expressly agrees as follows:

 

1\. Transfer of Units. Subject to the consummation of the Merger, the
undersigned hereby irrevocably transfers and surrenders all of the
undersigneds right, title and interest in and to all the undersigneds
Company Units listed in this Member Letter, and the undersigned acknowledges
and agrees that upon consummation of the Merger all such Company Units shall
be cancelled and of no further force or effect, and shall from and after the
consummation of the Merger represent only the right to  receive the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to such Company Units
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and Escrow Agreement. As and when such
consideration is to be paid, the undersigned hereby directs the Members
Representative to pay any and all amounts to which the undersigned is entitled
to be paid in respect of its, his or her Company Units in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, by the method of payment
selected by the undersigned in the "Payment Instructions" below.

2\. The Merger Agreement and Escrow Agreement. The undersigned acknowledges
receipt of a copy of the Merger Agreement, including the exhibits thereto, and
the form of escrow agreement to be executed and delivered by the Members
Representative and Parent at the Closing (the " _Form Escrow Agreement_ ").
The undersigned has reviewed and understands the Merger Agreement, the Form
Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and has had an
opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Company and legal
counsel as the undersigned has deemed necessary to evaluate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Form Escrow Agreement and this
Member Letter. The undersigned hereby irrevocably consents to the Merger
and approves, adopts, ratifies, accepts and agrees to be bound by the terms
and conditions of Article X and the other terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and the Form Escrow Agreement as if a party thereto, including any
obligations of holders of Company Units thereunder. The undersigned hereby
acknowledges the right of the Members Representative to act on behalf of the
undersigned with respect to the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
waives any notice with respect to any and all such actions.

3\. Purchase Price. The undersigned acknowledges that the portion of the
Purchase Price to which the undersigned is entitled in exchange for the
cancellation of such undersigneds Company Units will be determined, among
other factors set forth in the Merger Agreement and Escrow Agreement, by the
distribution waterfall set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the LLC Agreement. The
undersigned further acknowledges that the portion of the Purchase Price that
is initially distributable to holders of Units following the Merger will be
reduced by the Escrow Amount and the Holdback Amount.

4\. Representations and Warranties. The undersigned hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the undersigned is bound by the Merger Agreement (solely for
purposes of the indemnification obligations in Section 5.8(a) or any other
relevant provision thereof and the Members Representative provisions in
Article X thereof). The undersigned represents and warrants that the
undersigned is the owner of the Company Units identified as owned by the
undersigned in this Member Letter, of record and beneficially, free and clear
of all Liens (other than those arising under the Companys
Organizational Documents or applicable securities laws), and has the full
legal right, power, capacity and authority to submit the Company Units for
cancellation at the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement pursuant to this Member Letter. The undersigned represents and
warrants that other than the Company Units listed in this Member Letter and in
any other Member Letter submitted by the undersigned with respect to Company
Units held in a different name or form, the undersigned does not hold or own
(beneficially or of record) any additional Company Units and is not entitled
to receive any other Company Units. The undersigned represents and warrants
that the undersigned has full power, authority and legal capacity to execute
and deliver this Member Letter and to perform the undersigneds obligations
contemplated by this Member Letter and the Merger Agreement with respect to
the undersigned. The undersigned represents and warrants that the execution,
delivery and performance of this Member Letter has been duly authorized by all
necessary action (including, but not limited to, if the undersigned is a legal
entity, approval by its board of directors or similar governing body and,
if necessary, its stockholders or other equityholders) of the undersigned, if
any, and this Member Letter constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the undersigned, enforceable against him, her or it in accordance with its
terms. The undersigned represents and warrants that the execution, delivery
and performance of this Member Letter by the undersigned do not and will not
(with or without the passage of time or the giving of notice) (i) violate or
conflict with any provision of the organizational or other governing
documents of the undersigned (if the undersigned is an entity) or any Legal
Requirement currently binding upon or applicable to the undersigned, or (ii)
result in, require or permit the creation or imposition of any Lien of any
nature upon or with respect to the Units owned by the undersigned. The
undersigned represents and warrants that no authorizations, consents or
approvals are required to be   given to or made by the undersigned, as a result of, or in connection with,
his, her or its execution, delivery or performance of this Member Letter and
the transactions contemplated hereby (other than such authorizations,
consents or approvals as have already been given or made). The undersigned
represents and warrants that there are no judicial, administrative or other
Actions pending that question the validity of this Member Letter or which, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
upon the ability of the undersigned to enter into or perform his, her or its
obligations under this Member Letter. No Person acting on behalf of
the undersigned or any of his, hers or its respective Affiliates or under the
authority of any of the foregoing is or will be entitled to any brokers or
finders fee or any other commission or similar fee, directly or indirectly,
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Member Letter
or the Merger Agreement.

5\. Appointment of Representative. The undersigned hereby irrevocably
appoints and ratifies, acknowledges and accepts the appointment of the
Members Representative and any successor representative, as its attorney-in-
fact, with full power and authority, including power of substitution, acting
in the name of, for and on behalf of the undersigned and the undersigneds
heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, to have all of the
rights and to perform all of the obligations of the Members Representative as
set forth in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
This appointment and power of attorney shall be deemed as coupled with an
interest and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not
be subject to termination by operation of law or otherwise, whether by the
death or incapacity or liquidation or dissolution of any Unitholder or the
occurrence of any other event or events.

6\. Indemnification, Acknowledgements and Other Agreements. The undersigned
acknowledges that Parent is relying on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the undersigned in this Member Letter and on the
covenants and agreements of the undersigned contemplated by Article
X, Section 5.8(a) and otherwise under the Merger Agreement. The undersigned
acknowledges and agrees that a portion of the Purchase Price will be deposited
at Closing in the Escrow Account and, in the event there are any
indemnification claims made by the Parent Indemnified Persons under the
Merger Agreement, the undersigneds portion of the Purchase Price will be
reduced on a pro rata basis by the amount of funds in the Escrow Account that
are recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement and Escrow Agreement. The undersigned acknowledges and
agrees that part of the undersigneds portion of the Purchase Price will not
be paid until at least one year following the Closing Date, and may
thereafter be deferred until any outstanding claims by Parent Indemnified
Persons are resolved and any funds remaining in the Escrow Account are
released to the Members Representative in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The undersigned further acknowledges that and agrees that a
portion of the Purchase Price will be retained by the Members Representative
to cover expenses of the Members Representative in performing its duties
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Such retained amount will only be
distributed at the discretion of the Members Representative. Any expenses
incurred by the Members Representative that are not covered by such retained
amount shall be paid out of funds released from the Escrow Account for the
benefit of the former holders of Company Units, including pro rata by the
undersigned, before the balance of such funds are distributed by the Members
Representative to the Unitholders.

 

The undersigned will not be entitled to any consideration in the event that
the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement is not consummated. The
receipt of any consideration hereunder will be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and this Member
Letter and will be paid, to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement or
this Member Letter or applicable legal requirements, less any applicable
withholding taxes. All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this
Member Letter shall be binding upon the undersigned and the undersigneds
heirs, successors, assigns, executors, administrators and legal
representatives to the extent permitted by law and shall not be affected by,
and shall survive, the undersigneds death, incapacity, liquidation,
dissolution or other inability to act. The undersigned acknowledges that the
undersigned does not have dissenters rights, appraisal rights and/or any
similar rights and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives the ability
to assert any and all dissenters rights, appraisal rights and/or similar
rights with respect to any Company Units owned by the undersigned and the
undersigned hereby withdraws any written notice of dissent or demand
previously made upon the Company. The   undersigned shall take any further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as Parent or the Members
Representative may reasonably request, in the event that at any time after
the date hereof such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Member Letter or the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.

 

7\. Release. Subject to and conditioned upon the Closing and payment of the
Closing Consideration by Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the
undersigned hereby irrevocably and unconditionally for itself, and on behalf
of its heirs, executors, administrators and assigns and, if applicable, its
predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, affiliates and its and
their respective present and former directors, managers, members, officers,
employees, equityholders, agents and representatives, releases and forever

Subsidiaries), the Parent Indemnified Persons and their current and former
equityholders, from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action,
suits, damages, judgments, expenses, demands, attorneys fees and other
obligations or liabilities, whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, that the
undersigned may have had at any time heretofore, may now have or may have at
any time hereafter arising from, relating to, resulting from or in any manner
incidental to any and every matter, thing or event whatsoever occurring or
failing to occur at any time in the past and up to and including the date of
the Closing, whether or not arising out of or related to the undersigneds
capacity as a holder of Company Units (including as a result of the surrender
of Company Units pursuant to the Merger Agreement and this Member Letter in
exchange for the right to receive the portion of the Purchase Price
attributable to the undersigneds Company Units in accordance with the Merger
Agreement, including any claim based on the allocation of the Purchase Price
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (other than claims arising thereunder), and any claim with
respect to the Members Representatives retention of the Holdback Amount or
set-off of expenses from funds released from the Escrow Account for the
benefit of the members of the Company) and any and all claims related thereto
(including attorneys fees and costs), in each case, whether absolute or
contingent, asserted or unasserted, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown, due or to become due, and whether arising under any agreement or
understanding (collectively, " _Claims_ ");  _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to Claims (a) pursuant to the terms of, or enforcing the
rights of the undersigned under, the Merger Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, or any other agreement, document, or certificate entered into or
delivered in connection with the Merger, (b) that cannot be waived by
applicable Legal Requirement, or (c) made by the undersigned against the
Company pursuant to any indemnification rights set forth in the
Companys Organizational Documents and related to or arising out of the
undersigneds position as a director, officer or employee of the Company. In
no event shall Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates have
any liability or obligation whatsoever to the undersigned for breaches of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company set forth in, or otherwise under, the Merger Agreement nor shall
the undersigned have any claim or right to contribution or indemnity from the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any
amounts paid to any Person out of the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.

businesses, products (including products under development or contemplated for
potential development) financial condition and other matters (" _Confidential

representatives to, take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard such
Confidential Information and to protect it against disclosure. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if the undersigned is employed

held in different names on the books and records of the Company, then it will
be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Member Letters as
there are different holders of such Company Units. If the surrendered Company
Units are held in different forms of the name of any Person signing this

indicate upon signing, and hereby represents and warrants to the Company and

accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements entered into and to be performed solely within such
state, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or

more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the

FORM OF

 

NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

 

THIS NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated [], 2017, is made
and entered into by and between [], a Delaware limited partnership (together
with its affiliates, the "Investor"), and AK Steel Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("AK Steel").

 

WHEREAS, reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 30, 2017, by and among AK Steel, Drive
Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of AK Steel ("Merger Sub"), PPHC Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Company" and, together with its subsidiaries, the
"Companies") and PPHC Members Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as the Members Representative,
pursuant to which, substantially contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company surviving the merger and continuing as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AK Steel (the "Transaction");

WHEREAS, Investor will be receiving substantial proceeds in connection with
the consummation of the Transaction;

WHEREAS, Investor has had access to competitively sensitive and important
confidential information and trade secrets of the Companies and their
businesses, including information regarding the Companies employees, business
plans and relationships with their customers and suppliers; and

 

WHEREAS, Investor further recognizes AK Steels interests in protecting, among
other things, AK Steels relationships with its employees, customers and
suppliers, and the goodwill associated with its ongoing business.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

 

 _STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT_



     | 1. | _Protection of Confidential Information/Non-Solicitation_. 
---|---|--- 
 

Investor covenants and agrees as follows:

 

(a) Confidential Information:



     | i. |

During the period commencing on the closing of the Transaction (the "Closing")
and ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary thereof, Investor shall not, and
shall cause its affiliates not to, use or disclose, or cause to be used or
disclosed, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever or in any way,
other than after receipt of the prior written 

---|---|--- known by Investor and/or its affiliates as of the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Investor shall be permitted to disclose
Confidential Information to its advisors and to its current or prospective
limited partners in connection with its fund raising, marketing, informational
or reporting activities (solely to the extent such disclosure is of financial
or other operational Confidential Information customarily disclosed by
Investor to such current or prospective limited partners and is effected in a
manner consistent with the Investors customary practices) provided, in each
case, such person is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential
Information and directed to keep the information confidential in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or is otherwise subject to a professional
obligation to keep such information confidential (and, provided further,
that, Investor shall be responsible for any disclosure of the Confidential
Information by such persons in breach of this Agreement). 
---|--- 
 



     | ii. | _Required Disclosure_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that the disclosure of any Confidential Information is required
under any order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a valid
administrative, congressional or other subpoena, civil investigative demand
or similar process (any such requirement or request, a "Legal Action"),
Investor shall (A) promptly notify (to the extent not legally prohibited) AK
Steel of any such Legal Action, and (B) provide AK Steel with an opportunity
(if then available) to contest, at AK Steels cost and expense, the propriety
of such Legal Action (or to arrange for appropriate safeguards against any
further disclosure in connection with such Legal Action). If, in the absence
of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver from AK
Steel, Investor nonetheless is legally compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information, Investor may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that
portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be
disclosed, _provided_ that it exercise commercially reasonable efforts, at AK
Steels cost and expense, to preserve the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with
AK Steel to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. 
---|---|--- 



     | iii. | _Trade Secrets_. Investor shall hold, and shall cause its
affiliates to hold, in confidence all Trade Secrets of the Companies that are
known by Investor and/or its affiliates as of the Closing, and Investor
shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, disclose, publish or make
use of such Trade Secrets at any time for as long as the information remains a
Trade Secret, other than (A) at the direction of AK Steel or (B) pursuant to 
_Section 1(a)(ii)_. 
---|---|--- definitions apply: 
---|---|--- 

"Confidential Information" means any data or information, other than Trade
Secrets, of or concerning the Companies or their businesses that is not
generally known to the public or to competitors of the Companies. It is
understood that the term "Confidential Information" does not mean and shall
not include information which:



     | (A) | is or subsequently becomes publicly available without
Investors or any of its affiliates breach of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | is disclosed with the prior written approval of AK Steel; 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | is or subsequently becomes available to Investor or its
affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than AK Steel, the
Companies or their respective affiliates; provided, however, that, to
Investors knowledge, such source was not bound by any agreement with AK
Steel, the Companies or their respective affiliates to keep such information
confidential or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to
Investor by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, in each case, which
prohibits disclosure of such information at the time of its disclosure; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | was or is independently developed by Investor or its
affiliates or representatives without reference to or use of any Confidential
Information. 
---|---|--- 
 

"Trade Secret" means information including, but not limited to, any technical
or non-technical data, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device,
method, technique, drawing, process, financial data, financial plan, product
plan, list of actual or potential customers or suppliers or other information
similar to any of the foregoing, which (i) derives economic value, actual or
potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily
ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can derive economic value
from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that
are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.



     | v. | _Interpretation_. The restrictions stated in _paragraphs
1(a)(i)-(iii)_ are in addition to and not in lieu of protections afforded to
trade secrets and confidential information under applicable state, federal or
foreign law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted
as diminishing or otherwise limiting the Companies or AK Steels rights under
applicable state, federal or foreign law to protect its trade secrets and
confidential information. 
---|---|--- 

(b) _Non-Solicitation of Customers_. To protect the goodwill of the
Companies, or the customers of the Companies, Investor agrees that during the
period commencing on the date hereof and through the date that is three (3)
years following the Closing (the "Term"), it will not, and will cause its
affiliates not to, without the prior written permission of AK Steel,  directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of any other person or
entity, solicit, divert away, take away or attempt to solicit or take away any
Customer or Prospective Customer for purposes of providing or selling
functionally equivalent products or services as the Company or its
subsidiaries provided or offered prior to the Closing to such Customer or
Prospective Customer, if the Companies are then still engaged in the sale
or provision of such products or services to such Customer at the time of the
solicitation (or, in the case of a Prospective Customer, if such products or
services are the subject of active negotiations between any of the Companies
and such Prospective Customer as of the Closing. For purposes of this
_Section 1(b)_, "Customer" means any individual or entity to whom any of the
Companies provides services as of the date of the Closing and
"Prospective Customer" means the individuals or entities with whom any of the
Companies is in active negotiation concerning the purchase and sale of
products and services, on or prior to the date of the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Investor or any of
its affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, managers, members,
officers, equityholders, agents and employees, from, directly or indirectly,
soliciting or entering into an agreement or other business arrangement with
any Customer or Prospective Customer when such solicitation, agreement or
arrangement is unrelated to the products or services provided or offered by
the Company or its subsidiaries to such Customer or Prospective
Customer prior to the Closing.

(c) _Non-Solicitation/Hiring of Employees_. During the Term, Investor agrees
that it will not, and will cause its affiliates not to, without the prior
written permission of AK Steel, directly or indirectly, for itself or on
behalf of any other person or entity, solicit for employment or hire any
individual who is employed by any of the Companies as of the Closing;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the solicitation for
employment or hiring of any such individual from and after the time that (x)
such individuals employment by the Companies is terminated by the Companies
or (y) is six (6) months following the time that such individual resigns his
or her employment with the Companies; and, provided further, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit any advertisement or general solicitation that
is not specifically targeted at any such individuals, except that no such
individuals may be hired.



     | 2. | _Remedies_. An actual or threatened violation by Investor or
any of its affiliates of the covenants and obligations set forth in _Section
1_ may cause irreparable harm to AK Steel and there may not be an adequate
remedy at law for such violation. Investor agrees, therefore, to be
responsible for any breach of this Agreement by Investor or any of its
affiliates and further agrees that, in addition to any other remedies
available at law, AK Steel shall be entitled to seek equitable relief against
Investor and/or its affiliates in connection with the enforcement of the
covenants and obligations set forth in _Section 1_.

to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws
effective during the term of this Agreement, such provision will be
fully severable and this Agreement and each separate provision will be
construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from
this Agreement. In addition, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there will be added automatically, as a part of this Agreement a
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable, to the
extent such reformation is allowable under applicable law.  
---|---|--- 



     | 6. | _Governing Law._ This Agreement and all issues relating to
the validity, interpretation and performance hereof will be governed by and
interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of Delaware

would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

successors, permitted assigns, heirs and legal representatives.

but may be assigned by AK Steel to any subsidiary of AK Steel or to any
successor to or transferee of all, or any part, of the stock or assets of AK
Steel.
