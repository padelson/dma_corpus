PAYMENT OF CLAIMS 

| 
---|---

(Covenant): 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

in respect of an Actual Tax Liability, on the later of (i) the date five
Business Days after the date on which the Seller receives written details of
the amount of the Tax Liability from the Purchaser and (ii) the date five
Business Days before the date on which the relevant Group Company will finally
be liable to pay the Tax without incurring a liability to interest and/or
penalties (or would have been liable to pay the Tax but for the availability
of a Relief), for any payment under paragraph 2.1; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

in respect of a Tax Liability which is not an Actual Tax Liability, on the
later of: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the date five Business Days after the date on which the Seller receives
written details of the amount of the Tax Liability from the Purchaser; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

five Business Days before the date on which the relevant Group Company would
have had to pay the Tax without incurring a liability to interest and/or
penalties but for the setting off of a Purchaser's Relief; and 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

on the date five Business Days following the date on which notice giving
written details of the amount due is received by the Seller from the Purchaser

|

DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYMENTS 

| 
---|--- 

5.1

|

All sums payable by the Seller to the Purchaser under this schedule shall be
paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings of any kind save only as
may be required by law. 

 

70 
| 
---|--- 

5.2

|

If the Seller is required by law to make a deduction or withholding from any
payment referred to in paragraph 5.1, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser
such sum as will, after the making of any deduction or withholding, leave the
Purchaser with the same amount as it would have received had no deduction or
withholding been made. 

| 
---|--- 

5.3

|

If any sum payable by the Seller to the Purchaser under this schedule shall be
subject to Tax in the hands of the Purchaser, the same obligation to make an
increased payment as is referred to in paragraph 5.2 shall apply in relation
to such Tax Liability as if it were a deduction or withholding required by
law. 

| 
---|--- 

5.4

|

If the Seller pays an increased amount in accordance with paragraph 5.2 or 5.3
and the Purchaser obtains a credit or other relief as a result of the
deduction or withholding or Tax Liability, the Purchaser shall reimburse the
Seller with such amount as the Purchaser shall (acting in good faith)
determine as leaving the Purchaser in no better or worse position than the
Purchaser would have been in had no such deduction or withholding been made or
Tax Liability arisen, but only to the extent that the Purchaser can do so
without prejudicing the retention of any credit or relief obtained as a result
of the relevant deduction or withholding or Tax Liability. 

| 
---|--- 

5.5

|

If the Purchaser assigns its rights under this agreement pursuant to Clause 16
(Assignment and Successors), then the assignee is only entitled to receive
payment under paragraph 5.2 or 5.3 to the same extent as the Purchaser would
have been entitled if the assignment had not occurred. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

MITIGATION 

| 
---|--- 

6.1

|

The Purchaser shall, at the written direction of the Seller, procure that a
Group Company takes all steps the Seller may reasonably require to: 

| 
---|--- 

6.1.1

|

use to the extent permitted by law all Reliefs that are available to that
Group Company, other than any Purchaser's Relief, and to provide to the
Seller, at the Seller\'s expense, a certificate from the auditors of that
Group Company confirming that all such Reliefs have been so used; and 

| 
---|--- 

6.1.2

|

make to the extent permitted by law all claims and elections specified by the
Seller that do not require the relevant Group Company to use any Purchaser's
Relief, 

in either case that have the effect of reducing any matter in respect of which
the Purchaser would otherwise have been able to make a Tax Claim and the
Seller\'s liability in respect of the Tax Claim shall be reduced accordingly.

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

OVER-PROVISIONS, TAX REPAYMENTS AND CORRESPONDING RELIEF 

| 
---|--- 

7.1

|

If before the later of the second anniversary of the Completion Date and the
expiry of the Escrow Period: 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.2

|

any provision for Tax in the Accounts proves to be an over-provision (other
than to the extent the over-provision has arisen or been increased as a result
of any retrospective change in the law after Completion or the application of
any Purchaser's Relief) (an "Over-Provision"); or 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.3

|

the amount by which any right to repayment of Tax (including any interest or
repayment supplement) which has been treated (or, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting practice, could have been treated) as an asset in the
Accounts proves to have been under-stated (a "Tax Repayment"); or 

 

71 
| 
---|--- 

7.1.4

|

a payment by the Seller in respect of any Tax Claim or the matter giving rise
to such Tax Claim gives rise to a Corresponding Relief which results in a
saving of Tax for the relevant Group Company, 

then the Over-Provision, Tax Repayment or Tax saved by the Corresponding
Relief (in each case, the "Relevant Amount") shall be dealt with in accordance
with paragraph 7.2.

| 
---|--- 

7.2

|

The Relevant Amount: 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.1

|

shall first be set off against any payment then due from the Seller under a
Tax Claim; 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.2

|

to the extent there is an excess of the Relevant Amount after any application
of it under sub-paragraph 7.2.1, a refund shall be made to the Seller of any
previous payment or payments made by the Seller under a Tax Claim and not
previously refunded under this sub-paragraph, up to the amount of such excess;
and 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.3

|

to the extent that the excess referred to in sub-paragraph 7.2.2 is not
exhausted under that sub-paragraph, the remainder of that excess shall be
carried forward and set off against any future payment or payments which
become due from the Seller under a Tax Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3

|

If the Purchaser or a Group Company becomes aware of any circumstances which
give rise or may give rise to the application of paragraph 7.1, the Purchaser
shall or shall procure that the relevant Group Company shall as soon as
reasonably practicable give written notice of the same to the Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

7.4

|

The Seller may (at its own cost) require the auditors for the time being of
the relevant Group Company to certify the existence and quantum of any
Relevant Amount and the date on which the Corresponding Relief is utilised
and, in the absence of manifest error, their decision shall be final and
binding. The Purchaser shall use reasonable endeavours to procure the
assistance of the auditors for these purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

7.5

|

If there has been a repayment of Tax to a Group Company that relates to an
Event occurring, or to any Income, Profits or Gains earned, accrued or
received, on or before Completion then, to the extent that the right to the
repayment of such Tax is not accounted for in the Accounts, an amount equal to
that repayment shall be paid by the Purchaser as an adjustment to the
Consideration. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTIES 

| 
---|--- 

8.1

|

If a Group Company is entitled to recover from any person (other than the
Purchaser but including, without limitation, any Tax Authority) any sum in
respect of any Tax Liability to which paragraph 2 applies or in respect of
which the Seller is liable under the Tax Warranties, the Purchaser shall
procure that the relevant Group Company shall: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

promptly notify the Seller of relevant details concerning such entitlement
after the relevant Group Company becomes aware of such entitlement; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

take all appropriate steps to enforce recovery under such entitlement (if so
required by the Seller and at the Seller's expense); 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

keep the Seller fully informed of the progress of any such action for the
purpose of making recovery in accordance with this paragraph 8.1; and 

 

72 
| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

promptly pay to the Seller the sum equal to the lesser of: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

any amount so recovered (together with an amount equal to any interest payment
or repayment supplement received by the relevant Group Company less any costs
incurred by the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company in connection with the
recovery); and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the amount already paid by the Seller in respect of the relevant Tax Liability
under paragraph 2 or in respect of the relevant Tax Warranty. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

CONDUCT OF TAX AUTHORITY CLAIMS 

| 
---|--- 

9.1

|

The Seller shall be entitled, at the Seller's expense, to resist any Tax
Authority Claim for and on behalf of and in the name of a Group Company which
is or could relate to a Tax Liability for which the Seller is liable under
paragraph 2 or under the Tax Warranties, subject to the remaining provisions
of this paragraph 9. 

| 
---|--- 

9.2

|

If the Purchaser or a Group Company becomes aware of a Tax Authority Claim
which is or could relate to a Tax Liability for which the Seller is liable
under paragraph 2 or under the Tax Warranties, the Purchaser shall give
written details of the relevant matters to the Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days). For the purposes of
this paragraph 9.2, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have given such written
notice to the Seller on the Completion Date in relation to a Tax Authority
Claim in respect of any Tax imposed by any Tax Authority in Brazil and which
is at the Completion Date being avoided, disputed, defended, resisted,
appealed or contested by the relevant Group Company in Brazil. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3

|

The Purchaser shall (and, where relevant, shall procure that the relevant
Group Company shall): 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

take such action as the Seller may reasonably request in writing to avoid,
dispute, defend, resist, appeal or compromise any Tax Authority Claim (a
"Disputed Claim"), subject to the Seller agreeing (to the Purchaser's
reasonable satisfaction) to indemnify the Purchaser or the relevant Group
Company (as applicable) against any reasonable costs which they may suffer or
incur as a result of taking such action (together with any Tax which is
required to be paid to any relevant Tax Authority in order for the Purchaser
or the relevant Group Company to take such action); and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

make available to the Seller such employees of the relevant Group Company or
the Purchaser as the Seller may reasonably require and all such information as
may be available and as may reasonably be requested by the Seller for
avoiding, disputing, resisting, appealing, compromising or contesting any such
Tax Authority Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

not: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

accept or pay or compromise any such Tax Authority Claim; or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

agree with the relevant Tax Authority any matter relating to the Tax Authority
Claim which is likely to, and which the Purchaser ought reasonably to know is
likely to, affect the amount of the Tax Claim or the liability or potential
liability of the Seller under the Tax Covenant or under the Tax Warranties, 

in each case without the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



73 
| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

Where the Seller resists any Tax Authority Claim for and on behalf of and in
the name of a Group Company in accordance with its rights under paragraph 9.1,
the Seller shall: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

keep the Purchaser informed of all relevant matters known to it or the
Seller's relevant advisers concerning any Disputed Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

provide the Purchaser with copies of all relevant documents or correspondence
in the Seller's possession or control in relation to any Disputed Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

submit to the Purchaser, for prior written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) any written or other communication related to the
Disputed Claim which is to be transmitted or communicated to the relevant Tax
Authority; and 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

obtain the Purchaser's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) to the appointment of solicitors or other professional advisers;
and 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

not settle or compromise the Disputed Claim without the Purchaser's prior
written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

| 
---|--- 

9.5

|

Paragraphs 9.3 and 9.5 shall not apply in respect of any Tax Authority Claim: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

to the extent that it would involve the Purchaser or a Group Company
contesting a Disputed Claim beyond the first appellate body (excluding the Tax
Authority which has made the Disputed Claim) in the jurisdiction concerned
unless Tax counsel appointed jointly by the Seller and the Purchaser (at the
Seller's cost) confirms that (taking into account, among other things, the
quantum of the relevant liability, the technical issues relevant to the
Disputed Claim and the likelihood of the Sellers successfully challenging such
Disputed Claim) it would be reasonable for the Seller to pursue that course of
action; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

if the Seller does not request the relevant Group Company to take any action
within 20 Business Days following the Seller's receipt (or deemed receipt) of
written details relating to the Tax Authority Claim from the Purchaser in
accordance with paragraph 9.2 the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company
shall be free to pay or settle the Tax Authority Claim on such terms as it
reasonably considers appropriate; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

where the relevant Tax Authority has alleged in writing that there has been
fraud or dishonesty on the part of the Seller or by a Group Company prior to
Completion; or 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

if the Seller fails to comply in a material respect with its obligations under

| 
---|--- 

10.1.4

|

act diligently in preparing the corporation tax returns and related
documentation for the Relevant Periods, deal with all matters within
applicable time limits and keep the Purchaser informed of the progress of the
same, 

provided that the Seller shall not be entitled to vary any claim for Group
Relief made before Completion and in relation to which a Group Company was the
claimant if the result of such a variation would be to increase the amount of
corporation tax payable by a Group Company (ignoring the availability of any
other Relief).

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

The Purchaser shall: 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.1

|

procure that each Group Company causes the corporation tax returns and other
documentation and matters referred to in paragraphs 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 (except
to the extent that they are not true and accurate in all material respects) to
be authorised, signed and submitted to the appropriate Tax Authority without
amendment or with such amendments as the Purchaser reasonably considers to be
necessary; and 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.2

|

at the expense of the Seller, give, and procure that each Group Company gives,
the Seller or its agent all such assistance as may be reasonably required to
prepare the returns and documentation mentioned in paragraphs 10.1.1 and
10.1.2, and conduct matters relating to them in accordance with the Seller\'s
rights under paragraph 10.1. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

The Purchaser or its duly authorised agent shall prepare the corporation tax
returns and related documentation of each Group Company and be responsible for
all other matters relating to those corporation tax returns for all Assessment
Periods ending after Completion. In relation to the Straddle Period only, the
Purchaser shall, or shall procure that each Group Company shall: 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.1

|

at least 30 Business Days before submission to the relevant Tax Authority,
deliver to the Seller for comment any corporation tax return and/or related
documentation for the Straddle Period and make such amendments to them as the
Seller may reasonably require provided that the Seller has communicated those
amendments to the Purchaser at least 10 Business Days before the date on which
the return or other document is to be submitted to the Tax Authority; and 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.2

|

at the expense of the Seller, give the Seller or its agent all such assistance
as may be reasonably required to exercise its right to comment under paragraph
10.3.1, 

provided that nothing in paragraphs 10.3.1 to 10.3.2 shall entitle the Seller
to request the variation of any Group Relief claim made before Completion and
in relation to which a Group Company was the claimant if the result of such a
variation would be to increase the amount of corporation tax payable by such
Group Company (ignoring the availability of any other Relief).

| 
---|--- 

10.4

|

For the avoidance of doubt, where any matter relating to Tax gives rise or may
give rise to a Tax Authority Claim, the provisions of paragraph 9 (Conduct of
Tax Authority Claims) shall take precedence over the provisions of this
paragraph 10 (Tax Returns). 

 

75 
| 
---|--- 

11.

|

PURCHASER\'S TAX COVENANT 

| 
---|--- 

11.1

|

The Purchaser covenants with the Seller to pay to the Seller an amount equal
to: 

| 
---|--- 

11.2.1

|

any liability to Tax arising as a result of a Group Company failing after
Completion to pay the whole of the relevant liability to Tax (such liability
to Tax being primarily a liability to Tax of a Group Company) by the due date
for payment of that liability to Tax, save that this sub-paragraph shall not
apply in respect of any Tax for which the Seller is at any time liable for
breach of a Tax Warranty or under the Tax Covenant; and 

| 
---|--- 

11.2.2

|

the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses properly incurred by the
Seller and any other relevant member of the Seller Group (other than internal

| 
---|--- 

11.2

|

|

paragraph 9 (Conduct of Tax Authority Claims) of this schedule shall apply to
this paragraph 11 (Purchaser's Tax Covenant) as if: 

| 
---|--- 

11.1.1

|

references to the Seller were references to the Purchaser and vice versa; 

| 
---|--- 

11.1.2

|

references to a Group Company in the definition of Tax Authority Claim were

| 
---|--- 

11.1.3

|

the exception in relation to the Seller's entitlement to resist any Tax
Authority Claim in respect of any Tax imposed by any Tax Authority in Greece

| 
---|--- 

(a)

by each such party when compared against the total aggregate amount paid in to

| 
---|---

instructions shall be accompanied by those submissions (if any) which the
Seller or the Purchaser wish to make in relation to the Undetermined Claim.

Seller and the Purchaser shall, within 5 (five) Business Days of such Opinion
and in accordance with the notification requirements of the Escrow Agreement,
issue a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent 

 

78 

to pay to the Seller an amount equal to the Best Estimate retained in the
Escrow Account as soon as reasonably practicable.

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

If the QC opines that the Undetermined Claim is not an Unreasonable Claim,
then: 

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

if the QC opines that the Purchaser is likely to recover an amount equal to or
greater than the Best Estimate (by reference to the top of the range of the
QC\'s estimate) if the Undetermined Claim is successful, an amount equal to
the Best Estimate of the Undetermined Claim shall continue to be retained in
the Escrow Account pending the Undetermined Claim becoming a Settled Claim: 

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

if the QC opines that the Purchaser is likely to recover an amount which is
less than the Best Estimate (by reference to the top of the range of the QC\'s
estimate) if the Undetermined Claim is successful an amount equal to the top
of the range of the QC\'s estimate of the Undetermined Claim shall be retained
in the Escrow Account pending the Undetermined Claim being a Settled Claim and
the Seller and the Purchaser shall, within 5 (five) Business Days of such
opinion and in accordance with the notification requirements of the Escrow
Agreement, issue a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller
the difference between the Best Estimate and the top of the range of the QC\'s
estimate as soon as practicable. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Following the Escrow Release Date, upon settlement of all Claims such that
there are no Undetermined Claims left outstanding, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall, in accordance with the notification requirements of the
Escrow Agreement, issue a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Seller the Escrow Amount (if any) then remaining as soon as reasonably
practicable. 

|

Payment of any amount in accordance with this schedule 6 to settle an Escrow
Claim shall, so far as possible, be deemed to be a reduction of the
