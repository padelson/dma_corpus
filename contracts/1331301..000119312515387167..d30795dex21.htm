other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER



 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article VII, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares
of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms
of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or change, modify
or waive any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the holders of Common
Stock, (v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer (except
as required or permitted by the provisions of Section 1.1(c)), (vi) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, or (vii) otherwise amend, modify
or supplement any of the other terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Common Stock.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The initial expiration date of
the Offer shall be 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Exchange Act Rule 14d-1(g)(3)). Subject to the parties rights to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and Merger Subs right to waive any
Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition), Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) extend the Offer for the minimum
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, (ii) if, on the initial
expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to
expire, any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived, extend
the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of up to five (5)
Business

 



2  Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) until such
time as each such condition shall have been satisfied or waived and (iii) if,
on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer
is scheduled to expire, each Offer Condition has been satisfied or waived and
the Bank Marketing Period did not end on or prior to the immediately preceding
Business Day, extend the Offer for one or more periods of up to five (5)
Business Days each (the length of such period to be determined by Parent)
until such time as the Bank Marketing Period shall have ended; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date or the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII and (2) if, at any otherwise scheduled expiration
of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions except for the Minimum Tender
Condition shall have been satisfied or waived and the Bank Marketing Period
shall have ended, Merger Sub shall in such situation be required to extend the
Offer in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days each but in
no event more than fifteen (15) Business Days in the aggregate (or such other
period as the parties hereto may agree). The Offer may not be terminated prior
to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(c)) unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Article VII. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII prior to any scheduled
expiration thereof, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.

 

(d) _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to),

action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the Company:

 

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately

any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Common Stock) with a record date during such period, then the
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change.

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the "

deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for payment in accordance
with this Article II through the Paying Agent, sufficient funds in amounts
necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable
under this Article II and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay
the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable under this Article II in
accordance with this Agreement. Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly (but in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a share of Common Stock converted pursuant
to Section 2.1(c)(i), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form,
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
such holders shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to
the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and (B) instructions
for surrendering such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Such instructions shall provide that: (x) at the
election of the surrendering holder, Certificates may be surrendered by hand
delivery or otherwise, and (y) the Merger Consideration payable in exchange
for Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares will be payable by wire transfer to
the surrendering holder.

 

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent in respect of Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive,
and the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the number of shares formerly evidenced by that
Certificate or such Book-Entry Share less any required withholding of Taxes.
Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled
immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any amount payable upon
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



9 (iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so
long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents
required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment (x) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (y)
establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that
any such transfer Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the execution and delivery
by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement to provide indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such Person in respect of
the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section
2.2(c)(iii) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II. No cash payment with respect to the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
in accordance with this Section 2.2.

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment
made hereunder such amount as is required by Law to be deducted and withheld
therefrom in respect of Taxes. Any amount so deducted and withheld shall be
paid to the appropriate taxing authority and, to the extent it is so paid,
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



10 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share has not been surrendered prior to the 24-month anniversary of the
Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to the date on which the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority),
any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds investing in
such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the risk, of
Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall
be for the benefit of Parent;  _provided_ that no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Common
Stock immediately before the Effective Time and other amounts payable under
this Article II in accordance with this Agreement and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common
Stock immediately before the Effective Time to the extent necessary to
satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Article II.

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to
Parent upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has not complied with this Article II shall look only to Parent,
which shall remain responsible for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration, subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Option_ ") outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the occurrence
of the Effective Time and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of that Company Option, shall be canceled, and
each Company Option with an exercise price that is less than the Merger
Consideration shall be converted into the right to receive promptly following
the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined below) multiplied by
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be acquired upon
exercise of such Company Option whether or not then exercisable or vested,
immediately before the Effective Time. " _Option Consideration_ " means the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise or
purchase price (or, in the case of a Company SAR, the grant price) of the
applicable Company Option (or Company SAR). The Company shall cause any
Company Option with an exercise price that is greater than the Merger
Consideration to be canceled for no consideration at the Effective Time.

 



11 (b) At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right with respect to the
shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Company SAR_ ") outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by
virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company SAR, shall be
canceled, and each Company SAR with a grant price that is less than the Merger
Consideration shall be converted into the right to receive promptly following
the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Option Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company SAR, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, immediately before the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Company SAR with a grant price that is greater than
the Merger Consideration will be canceled for no consideration at the
Effective Time.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit in respect of shares of
Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU_ ," and together with the Company
Options and Company SARs, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the
Effective Time and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder of that Company RSU, shall be, to the extent not already vested,
vested and each Company RSU shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock underlying such Company RSU.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of Section 2.3(a), Section
2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c). For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the
amounts set forth in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c) is
subject to Section 2.2(f).

(e) Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event not later than
the first payroll date thereafter) the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each
applicable holder of a Company Equity Award the amount due and payable to such
holder pursuant to this Section 2.3. Any such amounts may, at Parents
election, be made through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, through
the Paying Agent or otherwise.

 

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.4), any shares of Common
Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented to it in writing, and (ii) has properly demanded the appraisal of
such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with,
the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled and cease to exist, and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL.

 



12 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if after the Effective
Time any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such
appraisal rights (through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or
otherwise), then that holders shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted
automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such
shares or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures
set forth in the letter of transmittal, in each case in accordance with

material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable Law, and (b) did not, at
the time they were filed, or if amended or restated, at the time of such later

16  the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary relating to the Company SEC Reports and, to the Knowledge
of the Company as of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Reports is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.

 

Section 3.10 _Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries included in the Company SEC Reports:

 

(i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the rules and regulations of the SEC;

 

(ii) were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis (except as
may be expressly indicated in the notes to those financial statements); and

(iii) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their consolidated results of operations, where included,
consolidated statements of stockholders equity and cash flows for the
periods then ended.

(b) The Company maintains a system of "internal controls over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and
expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Company Board, and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Company Assets that could have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.

 

(c) The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the date hereof,
the Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting, and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees, all information
with respect to which has been made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that
the Companys outside auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when required.

 



17 (d) Since January 1, 2014, each of the principal executive officer and the

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to
the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications
were true and correct on the date such certifications were made. For purposes
of this Section 3.10(d) "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding "extensions of credit"
or has arranged any outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or
executive officers in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.

of business consistent with past practice;

Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, on the other
hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC).

Section 3.12  _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, since the Balance Sheet Date through the date
hereof, (a) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have conducted their
business, in all material respects, in the ordinary course, (b) there has not
been any Company Material Adverse Effect, and (c) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement, would require the prior written consent of Parent under Section

extent related to subclauses (d) and (k) thereof).

 



18 Section 3.13 _Litigation_. There are no legal actions, arbitrations,
litigations, suits or other civil or criminal proceedings (collectively, "
_Legal Actions_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect if any such Legal Action were determined adversely
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no investigation or review pending or

Parent and its Representatives access at reasonable times upon prior notice
to the officers, senior employees, properties, books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish promptly such information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including the immediately preceding sentence), the Company shall not be
required to provide such access or information if it reasonably determines
that (x) such access may unreasonably disrupt or impair the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) such information
relates to any competitively sensitive written formula, recipe or code book
specification for any products manufactured, packaged, labeled, marketed,
sold and/or distributed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (z) such access

privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or would violate
any applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop an alternative to providing such information
that would not result in such disruption, impairment, waiver or violation of
Law, as the case may be.

any Legal Actions commenced, or to such partys knowledge, threatened, against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, that are related to the Transactions, and (iv) the material
failure of any party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement, in each case such that the conditions set forth in Article VI
or Exhibit A would not be satisfied or would give rise to a right a
termination set forth in Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.4(b), as the case may be.
In addition, the Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall notify the Company, promptly of any change or event having,
or which is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or which would reasonably be
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article
VI or Exhibit A to be satisfied. In no event shall (x) the delivery of any
notice by a party pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) limit or otherwise affect
the respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement, or (y) any such disclosure be deemed to amend or
supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty.

(c) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 20, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company with respect to the information
disclosed under this Section 5.3.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time. Before the Effective Time, the
Company shall, subject to and consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, exercise complete control and supervision over the operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.4(b), the Company shall not,
and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the making of any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry relating thereto, (ii) enter into or participate in
any discussions with any Person regarding a Takeover Proposal (other than to
state that the Company is not permitted to have discussions), (iii) execute or
enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
agreement in principle providing for or relating to a Takeover Proposal (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 5.4, or (iv) furnish to
any Person any non-public information with respect to or in connection with
any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any existing
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation heretofore conducted by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives with
any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) with respect to or in
connection with any Takeover Proposal and shall promptly request the return
from, or destruction by, all such Persons of all non-public information

 



36  previously furnished or made available to such Persons by or on behalf of
the Company within the last twelve (12) months in accordance with the terms of
any confidentiality or similar agreement in place with such Person. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on
the Company set forth in this Section 5.4 by any Subsidiary or Representative
of the Company shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.4 by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), prior to the Acceptance Time, following
the receipt after the date hereof by the Company of a written Takeover
Proposal that has not resulted from a breach or violation of Section 5.4(a),
(i) the Company Board shall be permitted to clarify the terms of such Takeover
Proposal, and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law, then the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal and upon
prior written notice to Parent, (x) provide access and furnish non-
public information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to
the Person or Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal (and their potential
sources of funding) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
_provided_ that any non-public information provided under this clause (x)
shall have previously been provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent
substantially concurrently (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
with the time it is provided to such Person or Persons (or any of their
potential sources of funding), and (y) participate or engage in discussions
and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company Board shall be permitted, to the
extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, to modify, waive, amend or release any
existing standstill or similar obligations owed by any Person to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
(but in any event within one Business Day) notify Parent in writing of the
receipt of any bona fide Takeover Proposal, or any bona fide request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Person with respect to or in connection with a
Takeover Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions thereof (and
including a copy thereof, if such proposal is in writing) and the identity of
the party making the proposal, and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and terms of
such Takeover Proposal or any changes to the material terms and conditions
thereof (and the Company shall as promptly as practicable provide Parent with
copies of any material written materials relating to such Takeover Proposal or
any changes to the material terms and conditions thereof) and of the status
of any substantive discussions or negotiations relating to such Takeover
Proposal.

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, qualify,
modify or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend)
the Company Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, (B) approve,
endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend,
or submit to the vote of any stockholders of the Company, a Takeover Proposal,
or authorize, resolve or agree to take any such action, or (C) fail to include

 



37  the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to recommend
against any Takeover Proposal that has been made public within ten (10)
Business Days after a request to do so by Parent (any of the foregoing, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or allow the
Company to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into following compliance with
this Section 5.4) or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any
such action.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), the Company Board may, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Company Board after the date of this Agreement and not resulting from a breach
of this Section 5.4, (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a)
to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such
action or (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only if:

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company shall have first provided written notice to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days prior to any such proposed termination or Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal that it is prepared
to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or
make an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any material change to the financial or other
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require an additional
notice to Parent and a new two (2) Business Day period), which notice
shall include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal, the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal and a copy of the agreement or proposal with respect to such
Superior Proposal and all related material documents (including any financing
commitments) with respect to such Superior Proposal, and, if requested by
Parent, shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have,
negotiated with Parent in good faith during such four (4) Business Day period
or two (2) Business Day period, as the case may be, to propose a modification
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal
is no longer a Superior Proposal; and

 

(iii) Parent does not make, within four (4) Business Days or two (2) Business
Days, as the case may be, after the receipt of such notice, a binding and
irrevocable written proposal to modify the terms or conditions of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that, upon
the acceptance thereof, would cause such Takeover Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
before the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, in response to an Intervening Event (that is not, for
the avoidance of doubt, related to a Superior Proposal), if (i) the Company
Board has concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that its failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) at
least four (4) Business Days prior to such Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall have

 



38  provided to Parent notice stating that an Intervening Event has occurred and
describing such Intervening Event, (iii) if requested by Parent, given Parent
during such four (4) Business Day period the opportunity to submit a binding
and irrevocable written proposal to modify the terms or conditions of this
Agreement or the Transactions and (iv) the Company Board shall have considered
in good faith any such proposal by Parent and shall have concluded in good
faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it would
continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law not
to make such Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.4(g) shall not be deemed
to permit the Company or the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change except in accordance with Sections 5.4(e) or 5.4(f).

 

Section 5.5 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to, provide to each individual who, immediately before the
Effective Time is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including any individual on short-term disability leave immediately before the
Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ ") and who is not covered by the terms
of a collective bargaining agreement, with (i) at least the same salary or
hourly wage rate provided to such Employee immediately before the Effective
Time, (ii) at least the same short-term (annual or more frequent) cash bonus
or commission opportunity provided to such Employee immediately before the
Effective Time, (iii) at least the same benefits under the Company 401(k) Plan
provided to such Employee immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the benefits provided under this subclause (iii) shall be provided
until December 31, 2016 and (iv) other compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided (x) to such
Employee as of the date of this Agreement or (y) to similarly situated
employees of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, after the Effective Time, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Employee for any lawful
reason and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans (including all
severance, change of control and similar plans, policies, practices and
agreements disclosed to Parent) in accordance with their terms as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan,
program, policy, practice or agreement, or interfere with Parents, the
Surviving Corporations or any of their respective Affiliates rights or
obligations to make changes as are necessary to comply with applicable Law,
this Agreement or any Company Benefit Plan.

 



39 (c) For all purposes under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, including
severance, benefit and vacation or other paid-time off benefits (but not for
accrual of pension benefits), made available to any Employee after the
Effective Time (other than any defined benefit pension plan) (the " _New
Plans_ "), Parent shall provide that (i) each Employee shall receive credit
for such Employees years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any
other entities) for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting
thereunder (but not benefit accrual) (except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of accrual of benefits or with respect to New Plans
created after the Effective Time for which similarly situated employees of
Parent or the applicable Affiliate do not receive past service credit), (ii)
at the Effective Time, any waiting time limitation in any New Plan is waived
to the extent such waiting time was satisfied under the similar or comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (iii)
all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work
requirements of each New Plan be waived or satisfied for such Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the
analogous Old Plan as of the Effective Time, and (iv) eligible expenses
incurred by each Employee and his or her covered dependents in respect of the
plan year in which the Closing shall have occurred be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for
such applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.5, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former director, officer, employee, independent contractor or
consultant of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or
kind whatsoever. No provision of this Section 5.5 is intended to modify, amend
or create any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

Section 5.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing
in favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in (i) the Company Organizational Documents or (ii) agreements between
an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (in effect as
of the date of this Agreement) to survive the Merger and to continue in full
force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years (plus ninety (90)
days) after the Effective Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth
in any applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

 



40 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or
relating to their services as directors, officers or employees of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was
serving as a director, officer or employee of such other Person at the request
of the Company, whether asserted or claimed before, at or after, or occurring
before or at, the Effective Time (including in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise). If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in
any Legal Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, advance as incurred any costs or expenses (including legal fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities ("
_Damages_ ") arising out of or incurred in connection with such Legal Action,
subject to Parents or the Surviving Corporations, as applicable, receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the
DGCL, to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable
Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the
event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Legal Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal Action
pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party
(and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified
Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Legal Action.

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after the Effective Time the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous with respect to claims
arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise) so long as
Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay an annual premium
in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to
obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than
or equal to the Maximum Premium, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section
5.6(c), before the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase
a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy, with an annual
premium not to exceed the Maximum Premium, covering the matters described in
this Section 5.6(c) and, if the Company elects to purchase such a policy
before the Effective Time, then Parent and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this Section 5.6(c) shall be satisfied so long as Parent and
the Surviving Corporation cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time.

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 



41 (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary
action so that the successors or assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

Section 5.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the other terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the Offer
Conditions and the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall be required to (i) vigorously
contest (including by means of litigation) (x) any Legal Action brought, or
threatened to be brought, by any Governmental Authority or any other
Person seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or make illegal the
consummation of any of the Transactions or seeking damages or to impose any
terms or conditions in connection with the Transactions, and (y) any Order
that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the
consummation of any of the Transactions or imposes any damages, terms or
conditions in connection with the Transactions and (ii) resolve any objections
as the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority may assert under any Law
with respect to the Transactions and to obtain any clearance required under
the HSR Act or any other approval, consent or authorization necessary under
applicable Law for the consummation of the Transactions (including agreeing
to and making divestitures, entering into hold separate arrangements,
terminating, assigning or modifying Contracts (or portions thereof) or other
business relationships, accepting restrictions on business operations and
entering into of commitments and obligations); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any such action with
respect to any material assets, material categories of assets or material
businesses.

statement, to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or
making any such public statement and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ that

and in compliance with Section 5.4(g) or relating to an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

43 Section 5.11 _Section 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall

Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 _Compensation Arrangements_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into, establish, amend,

lenders under the Company Credit Agreement, the payment and satisfaction of
all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder and the release
of all Liens on the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties and assets

waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or
other fees or bear or reimburse any expenses or make any payment to obtain
consent or to incur any liability with respect to or cause or permit any Lien
to be placed on any of its assets prior to the Effective Time, unless in each
case it has received prior reimbursement or is otherwise indemnified by or on
behalf of Parent, (ii) enter into any definitive agreement with respect to
the Financing prior to the Effective Time or (iii) provide any indemnity in
connection with the Financing unless the effectiveness thereof is not
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement will
require (A) any directors, officers, employees, agents and other
representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action
in connection with the Financing that would reasonably be expected to result
in personal liability to such director, officer, employee, agent or other
representative or (B) the Company Board as of the date hereof to approve any
financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the parties agree that any road
shows, rating agency presentations, preparation of documents (including bank
information memorandum or high yield debt offering

 



44  memorandum in connection with the Financing) and provision of information
with respect to the prospects and plans for the Companys business and
operations in connection with the Financing remains the sole responsibility
of Parent and none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives
shall have any liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties with

in this sentence shall reduce the Companys cooperation obligations under

rules and policies of the Applicable Exchange to enable the de-listing by the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock from the Applicable

event no more than ten (10) days thereafter.

Section 5.16 _Merger Without a Stockholders  Meeting_. As promptly as

necessary and appropriate actions to cause the Merger to become effective,
without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance
with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

Section 5.17 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall not agree (nor permit the Borrower to agree) to or permit any
amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights
under, the Financing Letters, in each case, without the Companys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would, or could
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing,
including by changing the amount of fees or original issue discount payable
pursuant to the Financing Letters (unless the representations in Section 4.7
remain true and correct after giving effect to such reduction), (ii) impose
new or additional conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the Financing in a manner that would be more
onerous than those conditions to funding contained in the Commitment Letter
on the date hereof, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, the Borrower
or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or
(iv) prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Financing or the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
that Parent and the Borrower shall be permitted, without the prior consent of
the Company, to amend the Financing Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners and syndication agents or similar entities. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall not (nor shall permit the Borrower to) release or
consent to the termination of the Commitment Letter or of any Lender, except
for replacements of the Commitment Letter with alternative financing
commitments pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 5.17. Upon any such
amendment, supplement or other modification of the Financing Letters in
accordance with this Section 5.17(a), the terms "Financing Letters,"
"Commitment Letter" and/or "Fee Letter," as applicable, shall mean the
Financing Letters, the Commitment Letter and/or the Fee Letter, as the case
may be, as so amended, supplemented or modified.



 



45 (b) Parent shall (and shall cause the Borrower to) use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange the Financing and obtain the financing contemplated
thereby as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under the
Commitment Letter, (iii) as promptly as practicable, negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding
that are applicable to Parent or the Borrower in the Commitment Letter and
the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (and not take any action that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially impair the consummation of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter), (v) enforce its rights
pursuant to the Commitment Letter, (vi) consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Closing, including by causing the Lenders to fund the Financing at the
Closing, and (vii) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the
Financing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event
that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter or it becomes reasonably likely
that it would become so unavailable, Parent shall (or shall cause the Borrower
to), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources in an amount at least equal to the Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be and that does not contain any
condition to funding that would be more onerous than those contained in the
Commitment Letter on the date hereof or any terms that would reasonably be
expected to delay or impede the consummation of the debt financing thereunder
beyond the date set forth in Section 1.6 (the " _Alternate Financing_ "), and
(ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such
Alternate Financing (each, a " _New Commitment Letter_ "), in each case which
New Commitment Letter(s) will replace the existing Commitment Letter in whole
or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a correct and
complete copy of any New Commitment Letter, together with any related
exhibits, schedules, supplements and term sheets, and a correct and complete
copy of any fee letter in connection therewith (it being understood that such
letter will be redacted in a customary manner). In the event that any New
Commitment Letter is obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing Letters," the "Commitment Letter" or the "Fee Letter" shall mean
the Commitment Letter and/or the Fee Letter, as the case may be, to the extent
not superseded by one or more New Commitment Letters (and/or any related fee
letter(s)) at the time in question, and any New Commitment Letter (and/or any
related fee letter(s)) to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Financing" will mean the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

(c) Parent shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing or any
applicable Alternate Financing, and (ii) promptly provide the Company with
copies of all executed amendments, modifications or replacements of the
Commitment Letter (it being understood that any amendments, modifications or
replacements shall only be as permitted herein). Without

 



46  limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company (A) of any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing, which breach or
default would reasonably be expected to cause the representations in Section
4.7 to no longer be true and correct, (B) of the receipt by Parent or the
Borrower of any oral or written notice or communication from any Lender with
respect to any (1) actual or threatened material breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to a Financing Letter or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing of any provisions of any Financing Letter or such
definitive agreements, (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to a Financing Letter or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing or (3) failure by a party to the Financing Letters to fund the
Financing or the reduction of any amount of the Financing, and (C) if for
any reason Parent at any time believes in good faith that it or the Borrower
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that their obligations under this
Agreement are not contingent or conditioned in any manner on obtaining any
financing.

(e) Upon request of Parent or Merger Sub, the Company shall provide
reasonable cooperation and assistance to Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or Merger Sub and that is necessary, customary or advisable in connection with
Parents and Merger Subs efforts to obtain the Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation and assistance does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing business of the Company), including the following actions by the
Company: (i) participating in a reasonable number (taking into account the
nature of the Financing) of meetings with (including using its reasonable best
efforts to participate in a reasonable number of one-on-one meetings with) the
Financing Sources and prospective lenders and purchasers of the Financing
(and using its reasonable best efforts to cause the members of senior
management and Representatives of the Company to participate in such
meetings), rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions,
and cooperating reasonably with the marketing efforts of Parent and Merger
Sub and their Financing Sources, in each case in connection with all or any
portion of the Financing; (ii) assisting Parent and Merger Sub and their
Financing Sources in the preparation of rating agency presentations, offering
documents, bank information memoranda, business projections, lender and
investor presentations, prospectuses and other similar materials for any bank
or other debt financing and similar documents required in connection with any
of the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to cause the
execution and delivery of reasonable and customary representation letters in
connection with the bank information memoranda; (iii) cooperating reasonably
with the Financing Sources customary due diligence; (iv) using reasonable
best efforts to take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (to the extent the satisfaction
of such conditions requires actions by or cooperation of the Company); (v)
requesting its independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to
Parent and Merger Sub consistent with their customary practice (including to
provide consent to Parent and Merger Sub to prepare and use their audit
reports relating to the Company and, in the event that any portion of the
Financing takes the form of a bond offering, issue any necessary "comfort
letters," in each case, on customary terms in connection with the Financing);
(vi) executing and

 



47  delivering, at and effective as of the Closing, such definitive financing
documents, as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub and are
required in connection with the Financing, and cooperating reasonably in
connection with the pay-off of existing indebtedness and the release of
related encumbrances, and Parents and Merger Subs efforts to effect the
replacement or backing of any outstanding letter of credit maintained or
provided by the Company at and effective as of the Closing; and (vii) at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing, providing all documentation and
other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
USA PATRIOT Act, that has been requested in writing at least 10 Business Days
prior to the Closing.

 

(f) The Company shall provide to Parent the Required Bank Information prior to
the commencement of a period (the " _Bank Marketing Period_ ") of at least 10
consecutive Business Days prior to the Closing ( _provided_ , that the Bank
Marketing Period shall not commence prior to January 4, 2016 and shall exclude
January 18, 2016 and February 15, 2016) or such shorter period as Parent
otherwise specifies in writing. The Company agrees that it shall give Parent
notice if it becomes aware that the Required Bank Information taken as a whole
is or becomes incorrect in any material respect. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its logos in connection with the Financing, provided that such
logos are used solely in a manner that does not harm or disparage the Company
or any of its Affiliates or their reputation or goodwill. All non-
public information regarding the Company and its Affiliates provided to any
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources or their respective
Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.17 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except for disclosure to
potential lenders and investors and their respective Representatives that is
reasonably required in connection with the Financing subject to customary
confidentiality protections. The term "Required Bank Information" means,
collectively, (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries included in the Company SEC Reports for the
most recent three fiscal years ended at least 90 days prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries included in the Company SEC Reports for the most
recent fiscal quarter (other than the final quarter of the fiscal year) ended
at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date and (iii) the information relating
to the Company described in clauses (ii) and (iv) of Section 5.17(e), to the
extent reasonably available to the Company and customarily required with
respect to a target company in the preparation of customary rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, business projections or lender
presentations by an acquiring company in connection with the arrangement
of loans similar to the loans contemplated by the Commitment Letter. It is
hereby agreed that the Company may notify Parent in writing when the Company
reasonably believes that it has provided to Parent the Required Bank
Information and any such delivery of written notice shall be deemed
conclusive evidence that the Company has provided to Parent the Required Bank
Information unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes that the Company
has not completed providing the Required Bank Information and objects in
writing (stating with specificity the Required Bank Information that has not
been provided) within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such notice.

 

(g) Parent shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and it
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from and against
any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties, damages, interest, awards,
liabilities or obligations directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any
such person or entity in connection with their cooperation and assistance
obligations set forth

 



48  in or related to Section 5.13 and/or this Section 5.17, except and only to
the extent such costs, expenses, judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties,
damages, interest, awards, liabilities or obligations are finally determined
in a judicial proceeding (and not subject to further appeal) to have resulted
from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, any
such Subsidiary or such Representatives, (ii) reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and such Representatives in
connection with their cooperation and assistance obligations set forth in or
related to Section 5.13 and/or this Section 5.17, and (iii) reimburse the
Company for all fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Companys independent
registered accounting firm or its other Representatives incurred in
connection with the cooperation and assistance obligations of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives as set forth in Section 5.13
and this Section 5.17.

OFFER CONDITIONS

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or this Agreement, but
subject to applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, Merger Sub shall not be required to
accept for payment or pay for any shares of Common Stock if:

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Common Stock
which, when added to the shares of Common Stock, if any, already owned by
Parent and its Subsidiaries, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures
that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee, would represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares
(the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

(b) the waiting period applicable to the purchase of shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act
shall not have expired or been terminated (the " _Antitrust Condition_ ");

 

(c) any of the following conditions have occurred and be continuing at the
time of expiration of the Offer or immediately prior to such payment:

(i) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order which is then in
effect that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger;

(ii) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

(iii) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 3.12(b) shall not be true and correct in all respects, at and as of
such date, as though made on and as of such date (except for representations
and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which shall
be determined as of that specified date), (B) any of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.8 (other than
3.8(d)), 3.27 or 3.28 shall not be true and correct in all material respects,
without regard to any "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications contained in them, at and as of such date, as though
made on and as of such date (except for representations and warranties made as
of a specified date, the accuracy of which shall be determined as of that
specified date) or (C) any of the other representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all
respects, without regard to any "materiality," "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifications contained in them, at and as of such date,
as though made on and as of such date (except for representations and
warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which shall be
determined as of that specified date), with only such exceptions as would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



Exhibit A-1 (iv) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect its
obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or before
such time;

(v) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or

(vi) Parent shall have failed to receive from the Company a certificate,
signed by an executive officer of the Company, certifying that none of the
conditions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph (c)
shall be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.

 

The foregoing conditions set forth in clause (c) are for the sole benefit of
Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent
or Merger Sub (except for the Minimum Tender Condition), subject in each case
to the terms of the Agreement and applicable Law. Any reference in this 
_Exhibit A_ or in the Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied
shall be deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived. The
foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver
of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not
be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

" _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means, as of any time, the sum of (A) all shares
of Common Stock then issued and outstanding; and (B) all shares of Common
Stock that the Company may be required to issue upon the vesting (including
vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion,
settlement or exercise of all then outstanding in-the-money options, warrants
or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Common Stock, or
other in-the-money rights to acquire or be issued shares of Common Stock,
regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions
thereof.

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached.

 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_

 



Exhibit B-1 EXHIBIT B

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

BOULDER BRANDS, INC.

_FIRST_ : The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the " _Corporation_
") is Boulder Brands, Inc.

 

 _SECOND_ : The address, including street, number, city and county, of the
registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange
Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, 19801, and the name
of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State of Delaware at such
address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

 _THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

_FOURTH_ : The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share.

_FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon
it by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized
to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

 _SIXTH_ : The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provisions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and this Certificate of
Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon stockholders and directors
herein, are granted subject to this reservation.

 

 _SEVENTH_ : A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the
directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal
or modification of this Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any
limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing
at the time of such repeal or modification.

_EIGHTH_ : Section 1\. The Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent
then permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it
exists or as it may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (whether or not by or in the right of the  Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually, and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create
a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which
he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Section 2\. The Corporation shall indemnify any person, to the full extent
then permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it
exists or as it may hereafter be amended, who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation except that no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action
or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 

Section 3\. To the extent that a person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or a director, officer, employee or
agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise with which he is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit
or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article EIGHTH, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection therewith.

Section 4\. Any indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 of this Article EIGHTH
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances
because he has met the applicable   standard of conduct set forth in said Section 1 or 2. Such determination
shall be made (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (ii) if
such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of
disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders.

 

Section 5\. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition
of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Corporation pursuant to this Article EIGHTH.

Section 6\. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to the other sections of this Article EIGHTH, shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under
any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or
otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article
EIGHTH shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
a person.

 

Section 7\. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance (and pay the
entire premium therefor) on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the
provisions of this Article EIGHTH or of Section 145 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 8\. For the purposes of this Article EIGHTH references to "the
Corporation" include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation
or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation so that any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent
corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this section with respect to the resulting
or surviving corporation as he would if he had served the resulting or
surviving corporation in the same capacity.

 

Section 9\. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Article EIGHTH shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Article EIGHTH. _NINTH_ : Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation
shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.
